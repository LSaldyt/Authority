10.2307/1216557| The Botanical Institute of the University of Coimbra has been interested in the floristic study of the Portuguese overseas territories ever since the time of Jlio Henriques. His successor, Lus Carrisso, made a botanical expedition to Angola in 1927 and on his return became convinced that it would be of advantage to correlate the material in both Portuguese and foreign herbaria in order to carry out his plan for a "Conspectus Florae Angolensis". He therefore asked for the collaboration of the British Museum, a request favourably received by Dr. J. Ramsbottom and sanctioned by the Trustees of the Museum. As a first result of this, Vol. I, fasc. 1 ("Ranunculaceae-Malvaceae") was published in 1937 by the Agncia Geral do Ultramar under the authorship of A. W. Exell and F. A. Mendona. In 1937, Carrisso led a further expedition to Angola during which he unfortunately lost his life. The second world war interrupted the work for more than ten years but in 1951 Vol. I, fasc. 2 ("Malvaceae-Aquifoliaceae") was published by the same authors under the aegis of His Excellency the Minister for Overseas, through the Junta de Investigaes do Ultramar. Both the British Museum and the Instituto Botnico de Coimbra are greatly interested in the regular progress of the work and it is confidently expected that His Excellency the Minister for Overseas will continue to give it his valuable support. 
10.2307/1216548|The relation between the number of genera and the number of species in the "Nomenclator Florae Italicae (Pars I)" has been studied. The method proposed by Fisher, based on logarithmic series has been applied. The obtained curves agree with the observed data; this means that the description of the flora, as given by the Authors, is very accurate and that the method has a good validity.
10.2307/1216360|Directions are given for storing herbarium specimens with the needed quantity of p-dichlorobenzene for the destruction of insect, mite and related pests in sealed Saran film pouches or envelopes. These pouches are durable, transparent, easy to seal, and possess a low gas transmission rate so that the pesticidal vapors will be retained sufficiently long to kill any pests present. The method is recommended for the worker with a small herbarium, and for those who receive herbarium specimens on loan, and who do not have access to the standard facilities for herbarium pest control.
10.2307/1217782|It has been shown that under the International Code, the original type element of the name, Amaryllis belladonna L. (1753) is the American Belladonna: (1) the 15 direct and indirect literature citations that support the phrase-name under it, including two detailed descriptions, one mentioning the detail of a hollow peduncle that separates it from the Cape Belladonna; and three unmistakable figures, one a colored plate, constitute the elements that Linnaeus definitely studied up to the time the taxon was published and included in it when published in 1753; (2) no manuscript notes or annotated herbarium specimens have been found that have any bearing on this case; (3) the epithet, belladonna is not in the class of typicus, genuinus, etc., and cannot be used to read the Cape Belladonna into Species Plantarum 1753, because Linnaeus had before him the colored plate of Merian, 1705, t. 22, of the American Belladonna, which unmistakably could be matched with the plant that was growing in the Clifford garden in 1735-37; (4) the phrase-name used by Linnaeus does not fit the Cape plant better than the American Belladonna because the terms, "multiflora" and "campanulatis" as used by Linnaeus and the contemporaries cited in England and France, include the American Belladonna; (5) under the Code, the Cape Belladonna, Brunsvigia rosea (Lamarck) Hann. (syn.-Amaryllis rosea Lamarck, 1783) was added by Linnaeus in 1762 to the original type element of Amaryllis belladonna L. 1753, as a discordant element and remained there until Lamarck in 1783 proposed the first valid name for the species as indicated under synonymy in the first part of this sentence; (6) the lectotype chosen, which had to be selected from among the elements that Linnaeus had definitely studied and included in the species up to 1753, is plate 194, Hermann, 1798; and (7) the typification of the genus Amaryllis L., will be reviewed in another article prepared for Taxon.
10.2307/1217774| The American plants collected by Humboldt and Bonpland were deposited in the Musum d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris, except for a large set given by Humboldt to Willdenow, who engaged to study the collection and write it up for publication. At Willdenow's death in 1812 this task devolved upon Kunth, who worked almost entirely with the collection at Paris, upon which the descriptions in the Nova Genera et Species of H.B.K. were based. Willdenow's herbarium was controlled for a time by Schlechtendal, who permitted Roemer and Schultes, and others, to use and publish Willdenow's manuscript names and brief descriptions. This resulted often in multiplication of synonymous names because of nearly simultaneous publication, particularly by Kunth in the Nova Genera and by Roemer & Schultes in the Systema Vegetabilium. The most critical dates of publication, from the standpoint of priority in nomenclature, are those of Volume 3 of the Nova Genera, and Volumes 4 and 5 of the Systema. It is shown that Volume 4 of the Systema was probably published after Fascicle 10, and before Fascicle 11, of the Nova Genera. It is also shown that Volume 5 of the Systema was probably published after Fascicle 12, and before Fascicle 13, of the Nova Genera. Numerous species described in the Systema were not identified by Kunth with any of his own species, and it is concluded that these were based on unique specimens represented in the Willdenow herbarium only. 
10.2307/1216643|1. Three species of Oxalis have been involved in the application of the two Linnean names "O. corniculata" and "O. stricta". These species are described and temporarily designated Sp. I, Sp. II, and Sp. III. 2. "O. corniculata" is shown to have at least three specimens of original material, there thus being no unique holotype. Two are of Sp. I and one is of Sp. II. 3. The specimen of Sp. II had previously been chosen as lectotype, but the choice is rejected as a misinterpretation of the original description and of what Linnaeus clearly meant. One of the specimens of Sp. I is chosen as lectotype. 4. "O. stricta" has two elements as original material, there thus being no unique holotype. One is a specimen of Sp. III that Linnaeus probably never saw, and the other is a cited figure of Sp. II. 5. The specimen of Sp. III had previously been chosen as lectotype but the choice is rejected as being clearly against Linnaeus' conception. The figure of Sp. II he cited is chosen as lectotype. 6. The view that literature citations in Linnaeus' Species Plantarum that occur joined with the diagnosis are primary for purposes of typification over those that occur on separate lines is rejected. 7. Some history of the names for the three species is given. 8. The conclusions are: Sp. I, the creeping, wide-stipuled, pantropical species, gets the name "Oxalis corniculata L.". Oxalis repens Thunb. is a synonym, a variety of it, or a separate species, depending on taxonomic judgement. Sp. II, the tall, cymose, nonstipulate, white-stoloniferous species, native to North America and widespread in Europe, gets the name "Oxalis stricta L.". The East Asian Oxalis fontana Bunge is a synonym, a variety or a separate species, depending on taxonomic judgement. Oxalis europaea Jord. is a taxonomic synonym. Sp. III, the hoary, cespitose species, native to North America and very rare in Europe, gets the name "Oxalis Dillenii Jacq.". This is the "Oxalis stricta L." of present American authors. O. Navieri Jord. is a taxonomic synonym.
10.2307/1217317|1. The present paper deals with the "Hydnaceae," which are defined in a purely artificial manner. 2. The typification of Grandinia Fr., Hydnum L. ex Fr., Irpex Fr., Martella Endl., Odontia S. F. Gray, Radulum Fr., Xylodon (Pers.) ex S. F. Gray, and several other names, is discussed at some length and the conclusions submitted for consideration. 3. Xylodon (Pers.) ex S. F. Gray is reduced to a synonym of Odontia S. F. Gray. 4. Cerophora Rafin. and Priapus Rafin. are considered synonymous with Lycoperdon Pers. (Gastromycetes), and Radulum Fr. with Eutypa Tul. or Xenotype Petr. (Sphaeriales).
10.2307/1216647|Although commonly attributed to 'H.B.K.' (Humboldt, Bonpland and Kunth), the "Nova Genera et Species Plantarum" was the work of Carl Sigismund Kunth. This paper outlines its history, contrasts the characters of Bonpland and Kunth and gives details of fasc. 6-12 (quarto) taken from parts in original wrappers as issued. It summarises new information about the contents of Kunth's "Mimoses", fasc. 1-9, derived from overlooked reviews in the Swiss Naturwiss. Anzeiger. Some names in this book were first published on the plates ahead of the relevant text.
10.2307/1217865| 1. This seventh part deals with the Thelephoraceae as traditionally conceived, not with the family in its modern strongly emended sense. 2. The correct name for the genus often referred to as Hypolyssus Berk. (or Podostrombium G. Kunze) seems to be Caripia O.K. (as already previously accepted by some authors). 3. The typifications of Gloeotulasnella Hhn. & L., Hypochnus Fr. (non Ehrenb.), Lyomyces P. Karst., and several other names are recommended for consideration. 4. Two proposals for conservation are repeated: Craterellus Pers. against Craterella S. F. Gray and Hymenochaete Lv. against Hymenochaete [P. Beauv. corr.] Nees. 
10.2307/1215980| A new project to write a Flora of Europe is announced by a committee of British and Irish botanists. Emphasis is laid on the great wealth of taxonomic data concerning the flora of Europe already published. These data are to be found in scores of Floras and in innumerable papers published in very diverse journals and periodicals, many of these works being expensive or difficult to obtain. Attention is drawn to the difficulties experienced by taxonomists, phytogeographers, evolutionists and other biologists in gaining access to this vast body of information and in making sense of it once the requisite facts have been ascertained. The discrepancies in taxonomic merit and completeness between the Floras of the different European countries and the inevitable nomenclatural and technical inconsistencies to be found in them are stressed. The ways in which it is planned to overcome these difficulties in the new Flora are outlined. The Flora will cover Europe in the generally accepted sense of the word and will link up with the area covered by Komarov's "Flora of the URSS". All the major taxa of Angiosperms and Gymnosperms growing spontaneously in Europe will be keyed and briefly described and the intention is to produce within a period of 15 years a Flora of the greatest possible use to biologists in general, both pure and applied. There is a discussion of the policy which will be adopted concerning the following points: nomenclature, synonymy, taxonomic categories, geographical distribution, hybrids, aliens, apomicts, chromosome numbers. An appeal is made to taxonomists for reprints of their papers. Details of the present organization of the Flora are given. /// [French] Un comit de botanistes britanniques et irlandais annonce son intention de rdiger une Flore d'Europe.

On trouve ces donnes dissmines dans une quantit de Flores et d'innombrables articles publis dans des revues et des priodiques trs divers et qui sont, pour la plupart, de prix lev ou d'accs difficile. Ces botanistes soulignent les difficults que rencontrent les taxonomistes, phytogographes, spcialistes de l'volution et autres biologistes dans leurs efforts de prendre contact avec cette documentation considrable et de l'interprter aprs identification des lments requis. Ils insistent sur les diffrences de valeur taxonomique des Flores des diffrents pays d'Europe, leur caractre plus ou moins complet et les variations invitables de nomenclature ou de technique qu'on y trouve. Les procds auxquels on a recours pour surmonter ces difficults dans la nouvelle Flore sont indiqus dans leurs grandes lignes. Cette Flore embrassera l'Europe dans l'acceptation ordinaire du nom et rejoindra la zone comprise dans la Flore de l'U.R.S.S. de Komarov. Tous les taxa les plus importants des Angiospermes et des Gymnospermes qui poussent naturellement en Europe y seront indiqus et brivement dcrits, le but des compilateurs est de publier dans un dlai de 15 ans une Flore qui soit de la plus grande utilit pour tous les biologistes.

Der ausserordentliche Reichtum an bereits erschienenen taxonomischen Unterlagen zur Flora Europas wird betont. Diese Unterlagen finden sich in einer Menge von Floren und in zahllosen Abhandlungen in den verschiedensten Zeitschriften. Viele dieser Arbeiten sind teuer und schwer erhltlich. Es wird auf die von Taxonomen, Pflanzengeographen, Genetikern und anderen Biologen festgestellten Schwierigkeiten hingewiesen, Zugang zu diesem weitlufigen Informationsgebiet zu erlangen und es nach Ermittlung der erforderlichen Tatsachen auszuwerten. Die Unterschiede im Wert und in der Vollstndigkeit, die zwischen den Floren der verschiedenen Lnder Europas bestehen, werden betont und die unvermeidlichen nomenklatorischen und technischen Widersprche, die sich in ihnen finden, hervorgehoben. Es wird angezeigt, wie diese Schwierigkeiten in der neuen Flora berwunden werden sollen. Die Flora wird den Bereich bearbeiten, den man gewhnlich unter "Europa" versteht, und dieser wird unmittelbar an das Gebiet anschliessen, das von Komarovs "Flora der U.d.S.S.R." behandelt wurde. Die wichtigsten Taxa der in Europa wildwachsenden Angiospermen und Gymnospermen sollen aufgeschlsselt und kurz beschrieben werden, und es besteht die Absicht, innerhalb von 15 Jahren eine Flora zu schaffen, die von grsstmglichem Nutzen sowohl fr Vertreter der reinen als auch der angewandten Botanik sein wird. Es wird ber das Verfahren diskutiert, das bei folgenden Punkten zu befolgen sein wird: Nomenklatur, Synonymik, taxonomische Kategorien, geographische Zuordnung, Bastardformen, eingeschleppte bzw, eingebrgerte Pflanzen, Apomikte, Chromosomenzahlen. Ein Aufruf ergeht an Taxonomen mit der Bitte um Separata ihrer Abhandlungen. Einzelheiten ber die gegenwrtige Organisation der Flora werden mitgeteilt. 
10.2307/1216093| [German] Seit der Ersetzung des als jngeres Homonym regelwidrig gewordenen Gattungsnamens Krascheninnikowia Turcz. ex Fenzl 1840 durch Pseudostellaria Pax 1934 hat sich der neue Name vllig eingebrgert. Insbesonders wurde eine Revision der Gattung auf ihm aufgebaut und eine Reihe neuer Art- und Variettsnamen wurde verffentlicht, so dass nun die Rckkehr zum frheren Gattungsnamen mehr nomenklatorische Umstellungen erfordern wrde als seinerzeit die Einfhrung des neuen. Die beantragte Konservierung von Krascheninnikowia Turcz. wrde sich daher nicht empfehlen. Angeschlossen werden literaturkritische und nomenklatorische Ausfhrungen ber Krascheninnikowia. 
10.2307/1215998|The post-Linnaean names that have been applied to bamboo genera are listed, with authorship, place of publication and typification. Notes have been added in some cases where questions have arisen as to the status of the genus or of the type species. For completeness, especially in the interest of beginners, the pertinent data concerning generic names that were not validly published (according to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature), as well as those whose spelling requires correction or interpretation, are included. The typification of names not validly published may, by some, be deemed unnecessary, but I believe that the reader's perspective may be improved by the addition of this detail in such cases. The author will be grateful to be informed of any case where a different type species than the one here designated for any given genus has been proposed elsewhere.
10.2307/1216212|A second, post-Linnean, edition of Hill, "A history of plants", is described. For purposes of botanical nomenclature Wiggers, not G. H. Weber, should be considered as the author of the "Flora holsatica". The names published as "species naturales" by Necker are to be considered as validly published generic names. A lectotype species is chosen for the genus Conicephala Hill and the genus Conocephalum Wiggers, a substitute name for the former. The common lectotype species of these genera, and the species Marchantia conica L., are in turn provided with a lectotype, the same lectotype serving for both. Conocephalum Wiggers is proposed for conservation against Conicephala Hill.
10.2307/1217504| 1. This eighth part deals with the four families mentioned in the sub-title and which may be united under the common denomination of hymenomycetous Heterobasidiae. 2. Seven new combinations are proposed. The name Septobasidium couchi Donk will be validly published. 3. Ditangium P. Karst. should be retained for the imperfect stage of Craterocolla Bref., the latter name being the correct one for the perfect stage. Achroomyces Bonord. is the correct name for Platygloea J. Schroet.; and Ductifera Lloyd, for Seismosarca Cooke sensu auctt. and Gloeotromera Ervin. Musciclavus Velen. is identified with Eocronartium Atk. 4. Kriegeria Rabenh. is impriorable, which makes Kriegeria Bres. (Xenogloea H. & P. Syd.) a legitimate name. Tremiscus (Pers.) Lv. is considered validly published and should replace Phlogiotis Qul. 5. Basidiodendron J. Rick is based on a species of Tremellaceae. 6. Xylissus Rafin. might well be a validly published name for Myxomycetes. 
10.2307/1216400| The following names are recommended for conservation: 424 Bambusa Schreb.; 899 Murdannia Royle; 951 Chionographis Maxim.; 952 Heloniopsis A.

The proposals to change the citations of Pterolobium R. Br. and Suaeda Forsk., nom. cons., are recommended for adoption. The proposed retypification of 7250 Plectranthus l'Hr. is recommended for adoption. The status of 9304 Actinella Pers. is clarified for the benefit of the subcommittee for diatoms. Removal of the following names from the list of nomina conservanda is recommended: 1050 Nothoscordum Kunth; 5600 Agonis Lindl.; 5625 Verticordia DC. The committee is opposed to conservation of the following names and recommends that the proposals be rejected: 11 Pherosphaera Hook. f.; 18 Nothotaxus Florin; 73 Elisma Buch.; 204 Baldingera Gaertn., Mey. & Scherb.; 209 Lasiagrostis Link; 1028 Apicra Haw.; 1964 Conocephalus Bl.; 2691 Enneastemon Exell; 3990 Zanthoxylum Mill.; 5408 Malacocarpus Salm-Dyck; 7000 Astrochlaena Hall. f. The committee finds conservation of the following names unnecessary and recommends rejection of the proposals: 32A Sequoiadendron Buchh.; 87 Elodea Rich.; 1048 Gagea Salisb.; 1402 Herminium R. Br.; 1410p Gennaria Parl.; 2896 Aethionema R.

The committee is opposed to the proposals that seek to establish the following orthographies: 87 Helodea Rich. corr. Reichenb.; 788 Ambrosinia L.; 891 Vriesia Lindl.; 1401 Chamaeorchis L. C. Rich. corr. Koch; 7484 Chaenorrhinum Lange (this spelling may be maintained by simple correction without legislative action). 
10.2307/1217268|Changes in legislation concerning the determination of names of families and orders are proposed.
10.2307/1216027|(1) Gossypium barbadense, in the original sense of Linnaeus, is merely a broad-leaved variety of G. arboreum L. It must bear the name G. arboreum L. var. nadam (Watt) Prokh. Thus, the name G. barbadense L. becomes a synonym of G. arboreum L., and in practice has to be eliminated. (2) The specific epithet barbadense is due here to its arbitrary transference by Linnaeus from a former collective species of Plukenet. No cotton of the South American group was ever described by Linnaeus. (3) The species of Gossypium, up till now erroneously named G. barbadense and representing the South American group, must bear, as its proper name, Gossypium peruvianum Cav.
10.2307/1217350|The following generic names are recommended for conservation as proposed: 2968 Ricotia L.; 3657 Lotononis (DC) Eckl. & Zeyh.; 5278 Erythrospermum Lam.; 6208 Pernettya Gaud.; 6212 Arctostaphylos Adans.; 6361 Manilkara Adans.; sub 6368 Planchonella Pierre; 7665 Anemopaegma Mart.; 7669 Phaedranthus Miers. The committee recommends the conservation of 7250 Dracocephalum L. with the type D. moldavica L. The committee is opposed to the conservation of the following names and recommends that the proposals be rejected: 402 Lepturus Trin.; sub 2201 Tiniaria Reichenb.; sub 2429 Krascheninikovia Turcz.; sub 2731 Himantandra Diels; 4626 Maytenus HBK; 6729 Chlorocodon Hook. f. The committee finds conservation of the following names unnecessary and recommends rejection of the proposals: sub 410 Hordelymus (Jessen) Harz; 2428 Anredera Juss.; 5159 Schima Reinw. 1825; 5943 Molopospermum Koch; 7096 Nonnea Medik.; 7584 Wulfenia Jacq.; 8561 Wilbrandia Silva Manso. The proposal to add, under 4190 Guarea (nom. cons.) Samyda L. to the list of nom. rej. was found unnecessary; it may, however, be added automatically. The committee noticed and verified the change of authority of the name of the type-species of 2066 Stenocarpus (nom. cons.) (this being a matter of fact and needing no action).
10.2307/1217857|Conservation of the following generic names is recommended as proposed: 2691 Enneastemon Exell; 3424 Rourea Aublet; 3753 Clianthus Solander; 5215 Hopea Roxburgh; 6914 Dregea E. Meyer; sub 7604 Agalinis Rafinesque; 7645 Bartsia Linnaeus sensu Bentham; 8428 Gaertnera Lamarck; 9712 Heteropyxis W. H. Harvey. It is also recommended that 22 Agathis R. A. Salisbury and 3753 Clianthus Solander be maintained as nomina conservanda (the latter by adding Sarcodum Loureiro to nomina rejicienda). The Committee recommends rejection of the proposals to conserve the following names: 3528 Piliostigma Hochstetter; 3830 Hymenolobium Bentham (which stands without conservation); sub 3899 Moghania Jaume Saint-Hilaire; 4606 Juliania Schlechtendahl; 4648 Rhacoma Linnaeus; 5331 Idesia Maximowicz; 7604 Gerardia "Bentham"; 7631 Castilleia Mutis ex Linnaeus (which stands because of recommended retention of Bartsia Linnaeus sensu Bentham); 9343 Allardia Decaisne ex Endlicher. The Committee recommends that Veitchia joannis H. Wendland be designated the type of Veitchia instead of V. storckii. In the view of the Committee no action is necessary to add Colocynthis P. Miller to nomina rejicienda in favor of Citrullus. The Committee finds no obstacle among names of flowering plants to the conservation of the algal genus Microchaete.
10.2307/1216002|Monocarpus sphaerocarpus Carr is renamed Carrpos sphaerocarpos. Certain aspects of the homonym rule are discussed. Attention is drawn to the lack of provisions in the Code concerning the correctability of generic names when used as substantive epithets.
10.2307/1217806|The International Organization of Biosystematists has been established to promote co-operation in the study of biosystematics and to facilitate the publication and exchange of information on this subject. The I.O.B. constitutes the Committee on Biosystematics of the International Association for Plant Taxonomy (I.A.P.T.-B) and is open to all persons working or interested in the field of biosystematics. Membership fees are the annual fees to the I.A.P.T. since all members of I.O.B. are at the same time regular members of the I.A.P.T. Existing regular members of the I.A.P.T. are invited to apply to the Secretary-General for membership in the I.O.B. if their interests lie in the field of biosystematic studies. Biosystematics is interpreted in a broad sense to include subjects such as experimental taxonomy, genecology, cytotaxonomy, micro-evolutionary studies and speciation. Autecologists, comparative phytochemists, developmental physiologists and others interested in any field relevant to biosystematics are also invited to apply for membership. It is emphasized that the I.O.B. is concerned with such studies in all groups of the Plant Kingdom so that it is hoped that algologists, mycologists, microbiologists and bryologists will play a full part in the Organization. A report is given of the first meetings of the I.O.B. Executive Committee, at which the following activities were planned: 1) The establishment of a registration centre at which biosystematic data and details of work in progress can be assembled and made available to all members. 2) The establishment of a system to expedite the acquisition of living plant materials for biosystematic work. 3) The preparation of a glossary of biosystematic terms. The Bureau is at Liverpool, and correspondence should be addressed to the Secretary-General, International Organization of Biosystematists, The University, Liverpool, 3, England.

10.2307/1216021|1. This Part deals with the generic names based on imperfect states of Hymenomycetes, exclusive of the Sporobolomycetaceae. 2. Asterophora Ditm. per Fr. (and its typonyms) as well as Ditangium P. Karst. and Syzygospora G. W. Mart. are evaluated as nomina anamorphosium and thus as of restricted priorability. The correct names for the basidiferous and 'complete' fungi corresponding to Asterophora and Ditangium are Nyctalis Fr. and Craterocolla Bref. respectively. 3. Special attention has been paid to those names that are based on imperfect forms of Botryobasidium Donk and related genera and of Nyctalis. 4. Isaria sphaecophila Ditm. is selected as type species of Ceratonema Pers. (non Roth).
10.2307/1216726|The Committee for Spermatophyta recommends conservation of the following names, as proposed: 4303 Breynia J. R. et G. Forster; 65 Aponogeton Linnaeus f.; 7897 Columellia Ruiz et Pavon; Carrichtera A. P. de Candolle; 4666 Turpinia Ventenat. The Committee is opposed to the proposals to conserve 5513 Lecythis Loefling; 8364 Laugeria J. D. Hooker; 4464 Gelonium Roxburgh. Without a formal proposal to examine, the Committee has studied the desirability of the conservation of 8598 Citrullus Schrader (nom. cons.). The sense of the Committee is that the conservation should be maintained.
10.2307/1217221| Die Autoren typisieren die Gattung Filago L. 1753 durch die Art Filago pygmaea L. 1753; auf Grund dieser Typisierung ist die Gattung Evax Gaertner 1791 synonym mit der Gattung Filago L. 1753; fr die jetzt bliche Verwendung des Namens Filago in der heutigen botanischen Literatur schlagen die Autoren den Gattungsnamen Gifola Cass. 1819 mit dem Typus Gifola vulgaris Cass. vor. 
10.2307/1217562|The tremendous advances in electronic data processing are likely to result in revolutionary changes in the theories and practices of taxonomy. The process of classification is being removed from speculations regarding the origin of the taxa being classified. A natural classification is one whose taxa share the largest number of properties and which is most useful for a wide range of purposes. The principles of numerical taxonomy are stated briefly and illustrated by means of diagrammatic examples. The relative roles of the taxonomist and computer are discussed and estimates given of computer time and costs involved in numerical taxonomic work. The numerical taxonomic work done in botany so far is discussed and the paper concludes with a brief mention of several problems of numerical taxonomy with regard to botanical work. These are: scarcity of characters, correlations between cytogenetic work and phenetic similarities, and problems raised by hybridization.
10.2307/1217563|Two amendments are proposed to Article 13, to clarify problems arising out of the decree of different nomenclatural "starting point" dates for different groups of plants. The name of the moss genus Mnium Hedwig is proposed for conservation over Mnium L., which is technically the name of a genus of liverworts.
10.2307/1216918|The Committee recommends the conservation of the following names: Piliostigma Hochstetter, Geophila D. Don, Sorghum Moench, Harrisonia R. Brown, Enallagma Baillon, Campsis Loureiro. It is opposed to the conservation of Schima Blume (1825), Phyllocharis Diels; and finds conservation of Cyanastrum Oliver against Cyanastrum Cassini and Peripterygium Hasskarl against Sioja Buchanan-Hamilton unnecessary.
10.2307/1216327|It is proposed that the Code of Botanical Nomenclature should include a provision that where a species of fossils is assigned to an extant genus, the diagnosis of that genus should be deliberately emended to include a time-range circumscription, adequately substantiated. The inclusion of the "special provisions concerning fossil plants" into the body of the Montreal (1961) Code of Botanical Nomenclature was an important advance. These provisions have as yet only been distributed by the editors, and have not really been digested, as is illustrated by the slightly imperfect wording of Art. 3, Note 1 on form-genera. The inclusion of fossil plants has scarcely begun to have the effect it should and will have on the whole Code. The proposal made below is of course advanced with a systematic and taxonomic purpose, but it appears that the most satisfactory way to achieve this purpose is to improve the Nomenclature Rules in the Code for the guidance of palaeobotanists; it is a "provision for the future" as suggested in the Preamble to the Code.
10.2307/1216311| Der bereits in mehreren Bnden vorliegende B.A.S.I.C. erlaubt es nicht, das Schrifttum engerer Arbeitsbereiche in wnschenswerter Vollstndigkeit zu erfassen, weil allein die titelbildenden Wrter bercksichtigt werden. Diese Titel sind oft nicht zweckentsprechend abgefasst. Es wird daher vorgeschlagen, die Titel wissenschaftlicher Arbeiten so zu gastalten, dass sie den Inhalt dieser Arbeiten erkennen lassen und knapp umreissen. Weiters wird angeregt, die fr B.A.S.I.C. angelegte IBM-Kartei weiter auszubauen und zum Erstellen von Schrifttumslisten auszuwerten. 
10.2307/1216139|The Committee recommends the conservation of the following names, as proposed: 2074 Loranthus; 4621 Microtropis; 3252 Pittosporum; 846 Cryptanthus; 7854 Sarmienta. The Committee is opposed to (or fails to recommend) conservation of 3471 Erythrophleum and 51 Pandanus as superfluous.
10.2307/1216692|The remains of secondary wood from "Araucarian type" (without centripetal secondary wood) have been described under the following generic names: Araucarites, Pinites, Cordai(o)xylon, Cordaites, Araucar(i)oxylon and Dadoxylon. They all should be assigned to the genus Dadoxylon Endlicher 1847. The generic name Araucarites Presl 1838 was first applied to impressions of foliage-shoots and cones. But it cannot be used for specimens with secondary wood which do not have an organic connection to those remains. The generic name Pinites Lindl. et Hutt. 1832 was first employed for woods only (Lindley et Hutton, Witham). Then for (other) woods and foliage-shoots and cones (Goeppert); at last for foliage-shoots and cones only (Endlicher). Corresponding with the modern authors the name Pinites should be rejected as "nomen dubium" (Code Art. 69). A clarifying division (Felix 1883, 1887) of the genus Dadoxylon Endl. s.l. in Cordaioxylon Gr.'Eur. 1877 ex Felix 1883, Dadoxylon Endl. s.str. (emend.) and Araucarioxylon Kraus 1870 presently is impossible. So the names of Cordaioxylon and Araucarioxylon are younger synonyms of Dadoxylon Endl. 1847, and for that they are illegitimate.
10.2307/1216705|This paper discusses the relationships between the closely allied dimeriaceous genera Dimeriella (Wentiomyces), Episphaerella, and Epipolaeum. It attempts to justify the retention of the validly described, distinctly typified taxa Dimeriella, Epipolaeum, and Episphaerella, and to demonstrate that Wentiomyces is a doubtful genus, which cannot be identified with any of the other three genera. Habit or biology is considered a more reliable diagnostic character than ascospore color in the classification of these genera. Epipolaeum is an epiphytic genus, whereas Episphaerella and Dimeriella penetrate the leaves. Episphaerella differs from Dimeriella solely in lacking ascocarp appendages; the validity of this characteristic in separating the two genera is not yet clearly established.
10.2307/1216294| Die Benennung der Echten Kamille ist auf zweierlei Weise mglich; sie beruht nicht auf der Auslegung der Artikel des Kodes, sondern auf der taxonomischen Interpretation der Originaldiagnosen und auf deren subjektiver Bewertung. 1) Matricaria recutita L. Sp. Pl. ed. 1: 891, Nr. 5, 1753; dieser Name ist nmlich lter im Vergleich mit den weiteren Namen M. chamomilla L. Fl. suec. ed. 2: 296, Nr. 764, 1755 und M. suaveolens L. l.c., Nr. 766. In diesem Falle sollte dem homonymen Namen M. chamomilla L. Sp. Pl. ed. 1: 891, Nr. 3, 1753 der Vorzug gegenber dem jngeren Synonym M. inodora L. gegeben und dieser bei der bertragung in eine andere Gattung als Basionym verwendet werden. 2) Die Verfasser betrachten jedoch diese Lsung als ungeeignet und halten die Stabilisierung des Namens der Echten Kamille M. chamomilla L. 1753 (exkl. diagn.) emend. L. 1755 fr die annehmbarste. Es wre zweckmssiger, die aufklrenden Ergnzungen, wie sie z.B. von Hylander (1945) direkt in der Zitierung eingereiht wurden, in die Synonymik einzuschliessen, wo es geeigneter wre, die ganze Problematik des Namens zu schildern. Durch die Stabilisierung des Namens M. chamomilla L. 1753 (excl. diagn.) emend. L. 1755 wre jedoch der Name M. recutita L. 1753 zum Synonym geworden, demgegenber der Name M. inodora L. 1755 erhalten wre. Zur Begrndung der erwhnten Emendationsart weisen die Autoren auf die traditionelle Anwendung dieses Namens in einer ganzen Reihe von Gebieten (auch nichtbotanischen) hin; ausserdem ist der Name auch in breiten Kreisen der Arzneipflanzenzchter eingebrgert und allgemein bekannt. 
10.2307/1217048|A randomization test of Sokal and Sneath's (1963) hypothesis of nonspecificity is described and applied to several sets of data. The test procedure consists of counting the number of random partitions of the characters in a study into subsets which result in differences equal to or greater than that observed in the original data. In only one of the eight comparisons made could the hypothesis be accepted.
10.2307/1217532|A brief account of the gel acrylamide electrophoretic method for the detection of plant proteins is given, particularly as this might relate to systematic problems. Such methods do not entail immunoserological techniques, the usual approach associated with protein detection by taxonomists; in fact gel electrophoresis permits the acquisition of useful pattern data (protein bands) within hours of the direct extraction of protein types from plant materials. In the several comparative studies for which data are available, gel acrylamide techniques reveal as many protein bands, and often more, as are detected by immunoelectrophoretic techniques. Examples of such data, using legume seed proteins, are presented; consideration is also given to the systematic potential of comparative studies of isozymes in which presumably homologous enzyme systems are compared.
10.2307/1216478| Jungermannia leiantha Grolle n. sp. is proposed for J. lanceolata auct. (non L. 1753). The author has selected as type (lectotype) of J. lanceolata L. emend. Mller: 'Dill. musc. 486, t. 70, f. 10, Fig. A' [Herb. fol. 156, n. 10; caespites duo ad sinistrum; J. riparia Tayl. c. coles.; Oxford (Dillenius-Herbar)]. J. lanceolata L. emend. Mller is put in synonymy of J. tristis Nees (1836) beceause of art. 69 of I.C.B.N. (1961). J. lanceolata L. emend. Mller is established as lectotype of the genus Jungermannia L. (1753) emend. Dum. (1835). This typification enables to retain the customary use of Jungermannia L. and makes conservation of Solenostoma Mitt. (1865) against Gymnoscyphus Corda (1835) unnecessary, since both names become synonyms of Jungermannia L. emend. Dum. 
10.2307/1216887| A neotype has been selected for Psilophyton princeps, the type species of Psilophyton. An emended diagnosis has been provided for the genus. The plant will continue to be a spiny axis bearing terminal sporangia. A second species of the genus from the same Gasp area will, when published, differ in having naked stems. Spiny axes from Gasp described as Psilophyton princeps var. ornatum by Dawson will be transferred to a new genus on the basis of new evidence. The so-called rhizomes of Psilophyton can usually be referred to Taeniocrada. 
10.2307/1216897| The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (1966) gives the following possibilities for formal stabilization of the nomenclature of fossil plants: (1) The starting point for valid publication of names of fossil plants (all groups) is 31 Dec. 1820. "Schlotheim, Petrefactenkunde, 1820, is regarded as published before 31 Dec. 1820." (Article 13 j). (2) "When a taxon of lower rank than genus is transferred to another taxon... the author who first published this as a legitimate... epithet (the author of the basionym) must be cited in parentheses, followed by the name of the author" of the new combination. (Article 49). (3) "In order to avoid disadvantageous changes in the nomenclature... this Code provides... lists of names that are conserved... These lists... will remain permanently open for additions." (Article 14). It is necessary that several names of genera used by Brongniart (1828 b) and others be proposed for conservation. These names are illegitimate if the rules are strictly applied. (cf. Sternberg 18221825). (4) Nomina conservanda proposita (detailed statement of the cases for conservation see text): (198) Sphenophyllum Brongniart 1828, (199) Asterophyllites Brongniart 1828. 
10.2307/1216382|The explanation of distributional disjunctions may shed light not only on the disjunct plants themselves, but also on the more general processes of evolution at work in the botanical world. Specific examples of disjunction from the malvaceous genera Gossypium and Cienfuegosia are discussed. Emphasis is placed not only on their geographical characteristics but on features of their life cycles as well. Two distinct types of disjunction may be noted. On the one hand are found bicentric species wherein the disjunct populations show no demonstrable evolutionary divergence. The distance separating such disjunct populations is generally great, implying long distance dispersal. On the other hand, disjunction is found among pairs or groups of vicarious taxa, wherein the vicariads are clearly differentiated at a specific or infra-specific level. The distances separating such populations may be great or small. The disjunction may thus have arisen either from long-distance dispersal or from isolation following range restriction. The role of biosystematic analysis in either case is to evaluate the possible existence of biotypic differences or isolating mechanisms that may exist. The basic question underlying all of this concerns the role of geographic isolation in speciation. It may be a necessary but not a sufficient cause for evolutionary divergence. The disjunction of higher categories (sections, genera, tribes), where direct biosystematic study is more difficult, is also discussed briefly. One example from Gossypium is presented as suggesting possible austral relations among certain of the sections of the genus, in conformity with patterns known in other ancient groups, and in support of an austral origin for the Angiosperms.

10.2307/1216408|1. The Icones plantarum of K. C. Schmidel were published in numerous fascicles over a period of 50 years. 2. The first edition was edited by G. W. Knorr. It consisted of 9 copper engravings with accompanying text and was published between Easter 1748 and Easter 1751. 3. J. Ch. Keller continued the work. This continuation, with a wholly revised text, consisted of plates 1-xix and pages [1]-72, published between 1762 and 1766. 4. Manipulus 1 was finished by V. Bischoff. By 1771 plates 1-xxv and pp. [1]-94 were available. 5. Manipulus 2, also edited by Bischoff, was published between 1775 and 1777 (tt. xxvi-1 plus text). Manipulus 1 was reprinted at the same time. 6. The "editio secunda" (manip. 1 and 2), by Bischoff, was published in 1782 and 1783. 7. Manipulus 3 was edited by Schreber after Schmidel's death and published, by Palm, in 1796-1797.
10.2307/1216409|Achras zapota L. (1753) is to be typified by Sapota fructu ovato, majori Plumier (1703), which is shown by Plumier's unpublished description and drawing to be a form of the sapodilla or naseberry. If a broad generic concept is adopted, the correct name for the sapodilla is Manilkara zapota (L.) P. van Royen, for the sapote Pouteria sapota (Jacq.) H. E. Moore & Stearn. If a narrow generic concept is adopted, the correct names are respectively Achras zapota L. and Calocarpum sapota (Jacq.) Merrill.
10.2307/1216411|A proposal is made to amend Article 35 of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature dealing with names published without clear indication of rank. Such names published before 1953 should be treated as validly published but inoperative in questions of priority. If taken up later in a definite rank the new name should be regarded as a new combination with the original name as the basionym.
10.2307/1216412|Nuttall's article entitled "Descriptions of Plants collected by Mr. William Gambel in the Rocky Mountains und Upper California" was first published in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (volume 4) between 21 March and 4 April 1848. This article subsequently appeared also in the Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (ser. 2, vol. 1) between 1 and 8 August 1848. Almost without exception current literature attributes the Nuttall names to the later publication. A list of the 144 names proposed by Nuttall in both articles, with present nomenclatural alignments, is appended.
10.2307/1216414|The generic name Walkera Schreb. (1789) (Ochnaceae) must be typified by Meesia serrata Gaertn. (1788). In view of past and present confusion Walkera Schreb. must be considered a later homonym of Walkeria Mill. ex Ehret (1763) under Art. 75 of the present Code of Nomenclature. The holotype of Meesia serrata Gaertn. is at L. The generic name Gomphia Schreb. (1789) must be typified by Ochna zeylanica Lamk (1797), a taxonomic synonym of Meesia serrata Gaertn. The name Campylospermum van Tieghem (1902) is a nomenclatural synonym of Gomphia.
10.2307/1216951|Problems in the use of electronic data processing (EDP) in biological collections are explored. To accomplish this, the uses of EDP, actual and potential, are first set forth. The uses are divided into three groups, depending on the source from which the relevant information is obtained. The problems themselves are then grouped into nine mutually exclusive categories. Each problem is discussed in detail. The concept of a decision context is introduced. Its use in making the overall decision as to whether or not EDP should be used in a particular situation is explained. A questionnaire on the problems of EDP in biological collections was returned by 22 curators. Their comments are incorporated into the appropriate places of the text.
10.2307/1216952|John Hill's "The British Herbal" was published in 52 parts between 24 January 1756 and 28 January 1757. Each part normally consisted of two sheets (8 pages) and three plates or of three sheets (12 pages) and two plates. A detailed list of contents of the parts and of the precise dates of publication is given, based on announcements in a London daily newspaper, the "Public Advertiser". Hill's nomenclature and taxonomy, and especially the status of his names under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, are briefly discussed.
10.2307/1216953|A phylogenetic evaluation of the genus Monarda is presented, based upon biological divergence including anatomical, chemical, cytological and morphological characters. The evaluation is patterned after the "Wagner Divergence Index" which is based on two main assumptions: first, since there is no logically tenable way of measuring objectively the value of various characters, they are treated as of equal value; second, any character that occurs in most taxa of a given group is probably the norm and therefore unspecialized; a character appearing only in a few of the taxa of a group is considered to be specialized. Of 118 classical taxonomic characters found in the genus Monarda, only 31 were considered to have recognizable evolutionary tendencies, and of 26 chemical oil constituents only 9 were judged to have evolutionary significance.
10.2307/1216954| L'examen microscopique du plan ligneux secondaire des Lgumineuses actuelles des espces d'Afzelia et d'Intsia et plus spcialement la prsence ou l'absence de vritables fibres septes dans leur bois, ont des consquences importantes sur la systmatique des bois fossiles correspondants. Les auteurs donnent une rvision des bois de Lgumineuses rangs dans le genre Pahudioxylon Chowdhury, Ghosh et Kazmi, 1960. 
10.2307/1216955|Caldesiella Sacc. is placed in synonymy with Tomentella Pat. nom. cons. on the basis of past and recently acquired evidence. Three new combinations are proposed, Tomentella crinalis (Fries) M. J. Larsen (= Caldesiella ferruginosa (Fries) Sacc.), Tomentella calcicola (Bourd. & Galz.) M. J. Larsen, and Tomentella italica (Sacc.) M. J. Larsen.
10.2307/1216143|A 3-dimensional model based upon a modified discriminant function analysis is considered to be a valuable aid to concepts of evolutionary relations between Froelichia (cottonweed; Amarantiiaceae) species. To test whether the model's configuration is a reflection of multivariate relationships rather than merely an artefact, a computer program was designed to simulate the kind of evolutionary change which characterizes Froelichia and many other "closely related" taxa. A 3-dimensional discriminant function model based upon five simulated taxa accurately portrayed the relationships programmed. This result, plus others not cited here, are taken as initial support for the validity of such models when applied to real biological objects.
10.2307/1216145|The term 'furuncle' (Lat. swelling; adj. furunculate) is proposed for use in describing plant organs having 'cystoliths' or 'raphids' as cell-inclusions, discernible in herbarium specimens as elevated areas on the surfaces of leaves and other organs.
10.2307/1216146|The determination of the stem of generic names ending in -is is a special task for each particular case. In the future it is preferable to avoid such names, except for quite obvious cases, viz. names having a second (final) part of either Greek or Latin origin ending in -is, or a Greek stem, with the widespread Greek element -itis (itidis), -yllis (ellidis) and so on. For existing names one should be guided by the following criteria: 1. the grammatical form of the ancient word (Latin or Greek). 2. the existing tradition (which in most cases does not contradict 1). 3. the formation of the stem by analogy.
10.2307/1216147|The genus Racodium Persoon was lectotypified as early as 1829 by E. Fries by the species R. rupestre Pers. This is a species belonging to the imperfect Lichens. The well-known cellar fungus Racodium cellare Persoon does not belong to the genus Cladosporium because of the different structure of the conidiophor, but to the genus Zasmidium Fries (1849) for which it is the type species [Z. cellare (Pers. ex Fr.) Fr.].
10.2307/1216148|A brief historical review of the genus Hexagona Fr. and discussion of its typification are presented. The indication of Hexagona crinigera Fr. as lectotype is considered to be the most suitable. The genus Hexagona Fr. should be restricted to the group of species included by Fries in 1838 in his first section, around which allied species should be grouped.
10.2307/1216149|Hibiscus L. was first typified by Ph. Miller who restricted the genus to the single species Hibiscus malvaviscus L. In order to retain present usage it will be necessary to conserve Hibiscus L. with the type H. syriacus L. and to conserve Malvaviscus Cav. with the type Hibiscus malvaviscus L. as proposed in Taxon 15: 43. 1966.
10.2307/1216150|In 1753, Linnaeus recognized three species of Chelone in Species Plantarum. The first of these is the type of the genus and does not concern us here. The two remaining species are actually members of the genus Penstemon as here understood. Although Francis W. Pennell designated types for these names in 1935 (Mon. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philad. 1: 217, 239), the discussion below attempts to show that the original usage by Linnaeus has not been preserved, and indeed has been switched one with the other. Since such names are empty of meaning, it is proposed that they be rejected as nomina transmutata.
10.2307/1216151|Formal recognition is given on the varietal level to the wild and cultivated forms of Capsicum baccatum L. Both C. microcarpum Cav. and C. pendulum Willd. are brought under the synonymy of C. baccatum L. The cultivated chili pepper of South America is now named C. baccatum var. pendulum (Willdenow) Eshbaugh.
10.2307/1216152|The correct name for the plant commonly cultivated and escaped in tropical areas currently known in horticulture as "Clerodendrum fragrans" is Clerodendrum philippinum Schauer. The name is here lectotypified; the main synonymy is listed.
10.2307/1216155|During the past seven years, while collecting plants in Venezuela, the author has resorted, whenever deemed necessary or expedient, to the use of formaldehyde. By using this liquid, it has been possible, within the confines of a limited budget, to devote more time in the field to the task of collecting plants, as well as to prepare a much greater number of specimens in greater quantity for the herbarium in a relatively shorter time, and at the same time to cut down on the bulk of equipment and labor costs for transportation of this equipment. In the course of preparation of specimens by the formaldehyde method, the author has made use of certain techniques and practises which he has found convenient. These methods may be of interest to his botanical colleagues in other areas, and are explained in the following paragraphs. Finally, some observations have been made on the subject of the preservation of specimens prepared with formaldehyde and the deterrent effects on herbarium beetles.
10.2307/1216166|The Committee recommends the conservation of the following names as proposed: 565. Metroxylon Rottboell, 804 Restio Rottboell, 2961 Barbarea R. Br., 3756 Lessertia DeCandolle, 5013 Hibiscus Linnaeus (with type H. syriacus Linnaeus); it recommends the removal of Hoorebekia Cornelissen from the list of nomina rejicienda; it regards the conservation of 5009 Malvaviscus Cavanilles as unnecessary; it does not recommend the conservation of 3656 Phaenohoffmannia O. Kuntze; it does not recommend the typification of 3709 Dalea, nom. cons. as proposed.
10.2307/1216498|Though there is no absolute distinction between the systematics of wild and cultivated plants, cultivated plants in general do differ in many respects from typical wild species. These differences are considered and their implications for the systematics of cultivated plants are discussed. It is concluded that while formal botanical categories can successfully accomodate both wild and cultivated plants down to the species level (i.e. the level of the binomial), they are inapplicable to the infraspecific levels of the systematics of cultivated plants. A flexible hierarchal system based on grouping of cultivars is proposed as a practical alternative.
10.2307/1216499| The naming of hybrids is insufficiently solved by the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. Terrell (1963) proposed to use the signs < and > in naming the products of introgressive hybridization. When there are hybrids with three components the number of signs is high. It is now proposed to use the Greek letter  (symbol for a double arrow) in naming introgressive hybrids (e.g. Betula pendula  Betula pubescens; B.  aschersoniana). In the case of dominance of one parent in the hybrid, this may be shown by an arrow (e.g. B. pendula  B. pubescens, in the case of dominant B. pendula). 
10.2307/1216500|Certain taxonomic problems of long standing within the heterobasidiomycete complex are reviewed and recommendations for a rearrangement in the classification of tremellaceous fungi (sensu lato) are suggested whereby the subclass Heterobasidiomycetidae is modified to exclude the Dacrymycetaceae. A new subclass, Metabasidiomycetidae, is erected and includes the holobasidiaceous Dacrymycetaceae and Ceratobasidiaceae as well as the Tulasnellaceae, the latter embracing such genera as Metabourdotia and Pseudotulasnella, which have incompletely divided basidia. The Ceratobasidiaceae as newly constituted, includes besides Ceratobasidium the genera Oliveonia, Thanatephorus, and Uthatobasidium.
10.2307/1216501| Rind oil components (excluding terpenes) of diploid and tetraploid selections of seven Citrus varieties comprising four species were compared by gas chromatography. The tetraploids were autotetraploid, asexual derivatives of the diploids. Percentages of the oil constituents were markedly similar between diploids and their respective tetraploids. Those significant differences which were found tended to occur at the same peaks among different varieties; the direction of the differences between diploids and tetraploids also tended to be the same for a given peak. 'Royal' grapefruit which may be a natural hybrid, showed several conspicuous differences between its diploid and tetraploid forms, and showed many differences from a more typical grapefruit, the 'Hall'. The diploid and tetraploid forms of 'Lisbon' lemon both had high percentages of oil in the regions of geranyl acetate, geranial, and nerol. The components ocatanal, linalool, nonanol, and -terpineol were present in substantial quantities in most of the varieties. Each variety could be distinguished from the others by the overall percentages of its various oil components. 
10.2307/1216502|The results of the flavonoid analysis of thirty representatives of the Hamamelidaceae, Myrothamnaceae, Platanaceae, Cercidiphyllaceae, Eupteleaceae, and Eucommiaceae are compared with the corresponding morphological, anatomical, caryological and palynological data. The study reveals the homogeneity of the group Hamamelidaceae-Myrothamnaceae-Platanaceae and its undeniable affinities with the Saxifragaceae. The Eupteleaceae and the Eucommiaceae do not belong to this group; the Cercidiphyllaceae, although close to the Magnoliales, have certain morphological and biochemical features in common with the Hamamelidaceae.
10.2307/1216503|In order to establish the reliability of the betalains as criteria for circumscribing the Centrospermae, taxonomists are requested to forward to the authors one or two voucher specimens of red pigmented species which might belong to the Centrospermae but which are not listed in the table of betalain-containing species.
10.2307/1216504|Fabricius' "Enumeratio methodica plantarum horti medici Helmstadiensis" of 1759 is essentially a list of names of species grown in the Helmstedt botanic garden. These names of species are often uninominal and should not be considered generic names.
10.2307/1216506|The nomenclature of the sporophylls and leaves of Carboniferous arborescent Lycophyta is very confused. These specimens are described under various names which may "throw science into confusion" (Code, Preamble). It is, therefore, necessary to give a detailed study of the problem. A proposal for a new and precise denomination of the sporophylls and leaves is made utilizing the possibility created by the code to conserve certain generic names: 1. Lepidostrobophyllum Allen. nom. cons. prop. Sporophylls. 2. Lepidophylloides Snigirevskaya. Structurally preserved leaves with simple bundle. 3. Sigillariopsis Scott. nom. cons. prop. Structurally preserved leaves with double bundle. 4. Sigillariophyllum Grand'Eury ex Arcangeli. nom. cons. prop. Compressions (and impressions) of leaves. The generic names Poacites and Cyperites used by several authors for phylloids of Carboniferous plants are to be applied only to Monocotyledoneae (Proposal for conservation with new type-species).
10.2307/1216507|The correct name of the Common Reed, usually called Phragmites communis Trin. is P. australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steudel. The Common Reed is rightly regarded as based upon a Linnaean species (Arundo phragmites Linn., 1753), and one is inclined to forget that, owing to the operation of the tautonym rule, the current name (Phragmites communis Trin.) dates only from 1820. This may explain why the existence of an earlier name has been overlooked.
10.2307/1216509|The correct name for the single species of Freycinetia occurring in Tahiti is F. impavida (Gaudichaud ex Hombron) B. C. Stone, comb. nov. based on Victoriperrea impavida Gaudichaud ex Hombron.
10.2307/1216510|The common unarmed pantropical species of Solanum traditionally known as S. verbascifolium L. must be called S. erianthum D. Don. The Linnaean type specimen of S. verbascifolium is no 248.1 of the Linnaean herbarium (LINN) and belongs to the prickly subgenus Leptostemonum.
10.2307/1216512|In December 1966, several new taxa from the Cenomanian of England were validly published and named as part of larger study on Mesozoic and Cainozoic dinoflagellate cysts (papers by Davey, Downie, Sarjeant and Williams in Bull. Brit. Mus. Nat. Hist., Supplement 3, 1966). A subsequent publication on dinoflagellate cyst assemblages from the Chalk of the Isle of Wight, England (Clarke and Verdier, 1967) included independent descriptions of these same taxa under different names: these latter names are junior synonyms and must be rejected, under Article 57 of the "International Code of Botanical Nomenclature". These names are here listed. In certain other cases, the diagnoses of certain genera and species are closely comparable but it is not at present considered that they are synonymous. These cases are noted and the reasons for retaining different names are discussed.
10.2307/1216517|Aims and scope of the "Flora Reipublicae Popularis Bulgaricae," of which three volumes have so far appeared (1963, 1964, 1965), are discussed with reference to herbarium collections, previous literature and general organizational questions. The fourth (Cactaceae-Crassulaceae) and fifth (Rosaceae-Leguminosae) volumes are in preparation.
10.2307/1217702|The technique of Key Communality Cluster Analysis developed by Robert C. Tryon is introduced into the biological literature. The value of this technique to biosystematics is illustrated by a study using taxa of the dicotyledonous family Limnanthaceae. Cluster analysis of characters emerges as an efficient way to comprehend the relationships not only among individual characters but among clusters of characters. Five major clusters were found among the 35 characters employed. The method can be used as a context for the generation of ideas and hypotheses on the origin and selective role of the observed character-clusters. Such hypotheses could then be verified or disproved by subsequent experiments. It can also be used to understand results obtained from a complementary taximetric analysis. Its relationship with other methods of character analysis is discussed.
10.2307/1217704| The recognition of infraspecific chemical differentiation and the existence of several infraspecific taxa at a definite moment of the metabolism, has resulted in some differences in scientific concepts. The author sets forth his suggestions in connection with some of these problems. The polychemism known to occur now in more than 600 species and the recognition in general of chemical taxa, makes compulsory a wider application of the rules of nomenclature as put forward e.g. by Ttnyi in 1958 and 1960. 
10.2307/1217705|The following proposals for stabilization of the nomenclature of Carboniferous plants are made: (1) Conservation of the generic name Sigillaria Brongniart (1822), taxonomic synonym of Rhytidolepis Sternberg (1822), and Euphorbites Martius (1822), (2) Citation of the generic name Sigillariostrobus as follows: Sigillariostrobus Schimper (1870) ex Feistmantel (1871). Type-species: S. goldenbergii Feistmantel (1876) ex Zeiller (1884). The nomenclature of Sigillariostrobus is very confused. If the rules are strictly applied, the name Sigillariostrobus Schimper (1870) is not validly published (unitary designation). Valid publication dates from 1871 (Feistmantel) or 1873 (Geinitz). The type-species of these authors, S. cordai and S. bifidus, must be transferred to other genera (Sporangiostrobus, Gomphostrobus). The name Sigillariostrobus used by subsequent authors (e.g. Grand'Eury, Zeiller) for species such as S. goldenbergii is, therefore, illegitimate. The species S. goldenbergii proposed as new type-species is described by Schimper (1870) but not designated as "species" (Feistmantel 1876: nomen provisorium, Zeiller 1884: valid publication). Nevertheless, the citation of S. goldenbergii as type-species seems to be the most reasonable solution of this problem. It would also be possible to reinstate the name Sigillariostrobus for Sporangiostrobus or Gomphostrobus. The species described by most subsequent authors under Sigillariostrobus must then be renamed. This solution, however, is not acceptable because it throws "science into confusion" (Code, Preamble).
10.2307/1217706|Five species of Sisyrinchium (Iridaceae) are of common occurrence in northeastern North America. A sixth species is endemic to Bermuda. Their rather similar morphology has led to differing applications of the names given the various species. Examination of materials available to the original authors indicates the correct names for these species to be as follows: S. angustifolium Mill. (= S. graminoides Bicknell, S. bermudiana sensu authors), with branched, relatively broad stems, broad leaves, and small blue flowers; S. atlanticum Bicknell, with branched, narrow stems with many geniculate nodes, narrow leaves, usually drying pale green; S. arenicola Bicknell, a provisional name, with branched, narrow stems and few or no geniculate nodes, narrow leaves, drying dark, and often with a fibrous base; S. mucronatum Michx., with very narrow leaves, unbranched and non-geniculate stems, often purplish spathes, and large violet flowers; S. montanum Greene (= S. angustifolium sensu Bicknell), similar but with somewhat broader leaves, larger capsules, and green spathes; and S. bermudiana L. (= S. iridioides Curtis), the coarse and ornamental, branched, Bermuda endemic.
10.2307/1217707|The type of Cristella is that one of the (unnamed) species from which the generic description was drawn up, and which Patouillard indicated merely as "Crist. cristata." It is known from Patouillard's subsequent work that the species indicated by this nomen nudum belongs to the (holobasidious) Corticiaceae. Selecting a (heterobasidious) tremellaceous fungus as type of Cristella is incorrect because it conflicts with the protologue of Cristella Pat.
10.2307/1217708|The common acceptance of Holmskjold as the original author makes typification of Ramaria Holmskjold per S. F. Gray with R. coralloides var. alba apicibus purpurascentibus advisable. Ramaria (Fries) Bonorden is then simply a later homonym and need not be conserved.
10.2307/1217726|The Committee recommends the conservation of the following names as proposed: 612. Prestoea, 631. Euterpe, 2551. Decaisnea, 3201. Vahlia, 3864. Glycine, 4244. Thryallis, 5256. Warburgia, 5384. Eucnide, 7421. Goetzea. It recommends the proposed changes in the citations of the conserved names 3718. Tephrosia and 4995. Malvastrum. It does not support the proposals for conservation of 280. Danthonia, 1540. Josephia, 3113. Thylachium, 3812. Lourea, 3910. Dolichos, 6505. Crawfurdia, 8874. Lagenophora.
10.2307/1217392|New chromosome counts on material of wild origin from the Magnoliales: Winteraceae, Himantandraceae, Annonaceae, Myristicaceae and from the Laurales: Austrobaileyaceae, Amborellaceae, Monimiaveae, Lauraceae, Hernandiaceae, and Chloranthaceae substantiate the assumption that primitive Angiosperms (woody Polycarpicae) are mostly ancient palaeopolyploids, ranging tot 24-ploidy (table 1). Chromosomal data point to the parallel and reticulate evolutionary patterns of woody Polycarpicae (fig. 2) and give important hints for phylogenetic affinities and improved systematic arrangements on family and generic levels. Remarkable chromosomal similarities with Amentiferae strongly suggest a monophyletic origin of Angiosperms from progenitors with x = 7.
10.2307/1217423|The Committee recommends the conservation of the following names as proposed: 690, Culcasia; 1399, Himantoglossum; 2923, Goldbachia. It does not recommend a change in the conserved type of 3444, Calliandra. It does not recommend the conservation of any of the following: Sub 1396, Galeorchis; sub 2201, Tiniaria; sub 2354, Torrubia; 3889, Pueraria; 3896, Cylista; 3899, Flemingia; 4224, Banisteria; 4279, Mundia; 4299, Reidia; 4445, Galearia; sub ?5024a, Bombacopsis; 6200, Chamaedaphne; 7338a, Dysophylla; 8002, Haplanthus.
10.2307/1216042|Computer programs are being developed and tested for editing dichotomous keys, particularly to meet the challenges offered by the Flora North America Project. An elementary editing system is available for revising previously prepared keys; the new versions are then printed in conventional indented form. An advanced editing system currently being tested improves the efficiency of the process and offers a choice of output formats. For this latter approach the data are stored in three files: a taxon list, a descriptor list, and a numeric representation of the key. A variety of editing procedures are possible, including additions and deletions of taxa, changes in descriptors, and even translation of the key from one language to another. The system is designed for compatibility with the first author's experimental programs for constructing keys and making direct identifications.
10.2307/1216043|A very particular flavonoid content, compared with the classical systematic data, allows to attribute a relatively isolated place in the order of the Rosales, to the family of the Bruniaceae, chemically studied for the first time.
10.2307/1216044|The results of a chemical study concerning 7 species of Cunoniaceae show the heterogeneity of the family. The classical systematic data and chemical features suggest that the Cunoniaceae are closely related to the Saxifragaceae and that the former are austral vicariants of the latter. The relationships of Bauera and Eucryphia to Cunoniaceae is confirmed.
10.2307/1216045| Details are given of the publication of Dennstedt's "Schlssel" giving "Linnaean" names for the taxa described in Rheede tot Draakestein's "Hortus indicus malabaricus". Dennstedt's work was published in two editions: in the Fortsetzung des Allgemeinen Teutschen Garten-Magazins (Oct. and Nov.-Dec. 1818) and as a separate with independent pagination (Oct. 1818). The nomenclatural evaluation of the new taxa is discussed and lists are given of validly published new combinations and of nomina nuda. 
10.2307/1216046|Issue is taken with the proposal by McVaugh and Bullock to deprive arbitrarily certain substitute names of their status of valid publication. A proposal is made to correct misuse of the word "orthographic" in the Code.
10.2307/1216047|A 'new taxon' is not, or only rarely, a newly evolved taxon whilst a new species is new only in a nomenclatural sense or, as it was phrased in earlier generations "new to science". The indication "nom. nov." must be regarded as a technical term indicating a new name replacing an old one which is illegitimate under the Code.
10.2307/1216048|The possibilities to typify the several hundred species in Linnaeus's "Systema naturae" ed. 10 (1759) which do not figure in the "Species plantarum" (1753) are analyzed. Many of these species can be typified because they were published by Linnaeus between 1755 and 1759 in other publications, others on the basis of the subsequent treatment in the second edition of Species plantarum (1762-1763). A small number of species (29) are difficult to typify and require further investigation. Some may have to be treated as nomina dubia or provided with a neotype.
10.2307/1216049|Gaterau's publication "Description des plantes qui croissent aux environs de Montauban..." of 1789 contains 73 names by Gaterau of which 50 are not listed in the "Index kewensis". These names are all validly published but illegitimate because proposed as new names for earlier legitimate ones which were considered inappropriate. The fifty names not taken up by the "Index kewensis" are here listed in accordance with their nomenclatural status (later homonyms, earlier homonyms, earlier publications of the same name and names totally absent from the "Index kewensis").
10.2307/1216050| An examination of the type specimens of two of the most widely distributed species of Acrochaetium growing in Liagora clarifies the status of A. liagorae Brgesen (which includes A. collinsianum) and A. barbadense (Vickers) Brgesen (including A. liagorae of Hamel and A. vanbosseae Papenfuss). Remarks are also made on A. laxum which has been confused with A. liagorae. 
10.2307/1216051|For some years there have been uncertainty and disagreement as to which name, Stilbella Lindau or Stilbum Tode ex Fr., more properly designates a genus of the Fungi Imperfecti and whether Stilbellaceae or Stilbaceae should be used as the family name. In view of the recent conservation of the latter family name for a taxon of phanerogamic plants (30) having as its type the genus Stilbe Bergius (1767), it seems appropriate to review the fungus nomenclatural problem.
10.2307/1216052|The genus Phragmographium Morris, is illegitimate and must be rejected because it is a later homonym of Phragmographum P. Henn. (Ascomycete). Morrisographium is proposed as a new name and the fungus must be named Morrisographium pilosum (Earle) Morelet.
10.2307/1216053| The genus Gymnocarpium Newman should be typified by the species Polypodium robertianum Hoffm. Then Phegopteris Fe, as typified by Polypodium phegopteris L., is legitimate. 
10.2307/1216055|The selection of Cuphea P. Browne as the correct name and author for the genus over the names Parsonsia and Melanium is discussed. The identity of the type species is established as C. decandra Ait. by comparison of the morphology and distribution of possible candidates with the original description of the genus.
10.2307/1216056|Dolichos lignosus L. (1753) should be assigned to the genus Dipogon Liebm. (1854). Psophocarpus palustris Desv. is a West African species characterized i.e. by short bracteoles and different from P. scandens (Endl.) Verdc. comb. nov. which occurs throughout tropical Africa and Madagascar.
10.2307/1216059|The generic name Cephalophorus Lemaire 1838 (before May) is without any possible doubt a provisional name, not validly published under Art. 34 of the Code. It should not be taken up in preference to the generally accepted Cephalocereus Pfeiffer (5 May 1838).
10.2307/1216063| In continuation of the history, nomenclature, and systematic of some mesozoic genera the genus Otozamites will be discussed. The name of this genus is an illegitimate synonym of Otopteris Lindley & Hutton. A conservation is proposed. There are given some remarks on the systematic position, anatomical features, nomenclature, and the oldest species. 1843 Otozamites Fr. Braun in Mnster: 36, nomen conserv. prop. (240) 1834 Otopteris Lindley & Hutton: 142, pro syn., sed cum prior. 
10.2307/1216064|Doliostrobus Marion should be separated from the apparently heterogenous form-genus Araucarites Presl. In keeping with palaeobotanical practice the latter should be retained for uncertain araucarioid remains. Doliostrobus, on the other hand, should be considered as a distinct, fairly natural taxon of generic rank with the type species D. sternbergii (Corda) Marion sensu Marion.
10.2307/1218001|A character for a group under study embodies the notion of "similar with respect to a basis for comparison" by inducing a partition of the group into classes called character states. Objects which are members of the same state are considered similar. The information in a character can be measured. This enables us to determine that i. Some characters share information with other characters. ii. Some properties may be predicted from knowledge of other properties. iii. Conventional notions of character "equality" and "weighting" are often misleading. iv. In a very real sense, a classification is a character and may be measured for its information preserving capacity. The information in selected characters of the genus Arceuthobium was analysed in this manner; the results of this analysis are presented.
10.2307/1218002|It is not possible to define a phragmobasidium or a holobasidium rationally without analysing whether the types of septa present in metabasidia and sterigmata are primary or adventitious. The type of septum formed is related to definite cytological changes. The occurrence of adventitious septa in metabasidia and sterigmata is reported in several species. It is not considered possible to use any combination of Patouillard's criteria of the subclasses Heterobasidiomycetes and Homobasidiomycetes to formulate a new classification of Basidiomycotina into mutually exclusive classes; nevertheless, these criteria remain important at lower levels of classification. Lowy's recent classification is not accepted (Lowy, 1968). Two alternative classifications are suggested.
10.2307/1218003|Lindane and dichlorvos vapors are effective in protecting herbarium specimens against insect infestations without associated deleterious effects to humans. Methods of application are simple, protection is long-lasting, and the toxicants are easily obtainable and relatively inexpensive.
10.2307/1218004|In the course of an investigation on several exotic species of Amelanchier naturalized in Europe, it proved to be necessary to make some corrections in the nomenclature. The most important is the establishment of a new name, Amelanchier lamarckii, for a species widely cultivated and often naturalized in the Netherlands and N.W. Germany, which has been confused hitherto with some other species (such as A. canadensis (L.) Med., A. laevis Wieg., or A. confusa Hylander). An extensive discussion of the problems mentioned here is to be found in the publication cited at the end of the article.
10.2307/1218005|An historical review of the genus Frullania Raddi and discussion of its typification are presented. Frullania tamarisci (L.) Dum. is selected as the type species and a type collection is designated. Thus the proper application of the subgeneric name Frullania is clarified.
10.2307/1218006| Considerable confusion has arisen over the validity and content of the genera Zonalapollenites and Tsugaepollenites. The problem is discussed and it is concluded that the latter generic name is junior synonym of the former. Since no type species was proposed for Zonalapollenites it is proposed that Zonalapollenites igniculus Potoni ex Pflug 1953 be regarded as type species. 
10.2307/1218007|It is proposed to accept as the correct spelling of generic names in Linnaeus's "Species plantarum" ed. 1 and "Genera plantarum" ed. 5 the spelling appearing in Linnaeus's "Philosophia botanica" (ed. 1, 1751) and to delete Article 74 from the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature.
10.2307/1218008|Under the present provisions of Articles 19, 22, and 26 of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, various taxa between the ranks of family and genus and genus and species and below the rank of species can have two equally correct names without any change whatever in circumscription, position, or rank. This circumstance, which is in direct contradiction to Principle IV and Article 11 of the Code, has come about through too broad extension of the tautonymic principle whereby the names of various taxa which include the nomenclatural type of the next higher taxon must be based either on the same stem as that name or must repeat the name or epithet of the next higher taxon unaltered. This principle works excellently for the names of taxa which include the nomenclatural types of families, genera, and species, respectively, but when extended to all taxa between the ranks of family and genus, to all subgenera and sections, and to all subspecific categories, it results in the possibility for two correct names for some taxa (without change in circumscription, position, or rank), depending solely upon whether or not the next higher rank is used in the taxonomic classification. Since the Code clearly specifies that a taxon can have only one correct name in a given circumscription, position, and rank, proposals are made to restrict the tautonymic principle to the taxa which include the nomenclatural types of families, genera, and species, thereby eliminating this conflict within the Code.
10.2307/1218586|Taxonomy is defined as a technique of systematics, which in turn is an aspect of evolutionary biology. The thesis is developed that, among scientists dealing with life, systematists are in a unique position to appreciate the reality of evolutionary processes and to help interpret them. The primary questions propounded by students of historical evolution delimit the area of systematic biology as the study of organisms in time and in space. While systematics is completely dependent upon other disciplines for its basic data, those data derived from observational approaches remain essential in providing the outline of the probable course of events in the past. Speculation, hypothesis, and cumulative circumstantial evidence are all valid parts of these approaches. Data derived from experimental approaches are also essential in clarifying matters of detail and in defining unexplored areas of endeavor. The systematist, to perform effective research, is required to adopt an external philosophical viewpoint in his contemplation of life on this planet and the prior phases of atomic evolution. This viewpoint, rejecting any but natural causes, is that of the cosmic optimist. Within the limits imposed by time, intellectual competence, and the currently available evidence, this viewpoint can most satisfactorily lead to a comprehension and an appreciation of reality.
10.2307/1218587|Recent trends in numerical taxonomy, with special reference to the classification of flowering plants, are reviewed. These advances are discussed under the following broad headings: the choice and scoring of characters and OTU's; the estimation of taxonomic resemblance; the representation of taxonomic structure; cladistics; and discrimination and identification. There is considerable activity on problems involving homology, numerical coefficients of resemblance, and clustering methods. The numerical study of cladistics is also of special interest, but it poses some very difficult problems. It is now evident that numerical methods can yield acceptable classifications, and they much increase taxonomic understanding of the groups that are examined. They are also valuable in many other branches of systematics.
10.2307/1218588|A discussion of speciation subsumes that we know what a species is, which operationally is true. Populations that are physiologically incapable of gene exchange and are phenotypically distinguishable pose no problem at the species level. When barriers are not absolute or when they are complete but the phenotypic differences are inconspicuous one must consider the quantitative and qualitative nature of the barriers to gene exchange relative to the number and conspicuousness of the phenotypic differences. In this context barriers to gene exchange and their origin are discussed with special emphasis placed on ecological differentiation and its role in the maintenance of the distinction between species. Speciation involving chromosomal alteration differs markedly from that resulting from genetic divergence alone and the products of the two modes are compared. The argument is made that an understanding of the mode of speciation can be of help in the interpretation of patterns of variation.
10.2307/1218589|The pattern of evolutionary phylogeny has been highly reticulate mainly on account of hybridization (crossing between individuals belonging to populations which have different adaptive norms) followed by stabilization and perpetuation of some of the hybrid derivatives. The significance of hybridization in obtaining a picture of evolutionary relationships is discussed. First the evolutionary advantages that might result from hybridization are considered, second the drawbacks; finally the ways and degrees to which such drawbacks may be overcome are discussed.
10.2307/1218590|Attention is called to the need for more systematic studies of cultivated plants. Various difficulties in the study of domesticated species are discussed with examples particularly from Capsicum and Lagenaria. Special attention is devoted to the problems of determining the wild ancestor and the original homeland of cultigens.
10.2307/1218591|The geographical distribution of the more primitive Hepaticae (subclass Jungermanniae) exhibits the same patterns of endemism and disjunction, and highly specific and restricted ranges as found in many groups of vascular plants. The subantarctic region is shown to have an unduly high preponderance of primitive genera present (ca. 50% of all known unspecialized types), of which very many are strictly endemic there. Many of these groups are cold-adapted types which seem to have exhibited only limited displacement northward as a result of late-Tertiary and Pleistocene deterioration of the climate; others (Blepharostomataceae) have shown some striking dispersal to the cold regions at the opposite side of the globe, but the bulk of taxa remain Antipodal. Other families (Gymnomitriaceae, Scapaniaceae) that seem to lack tolerance for warm climates are today very preponderantly Arctic subarctic (and Alpine-subalpine), but the most primitive taxa are still strictly subantarctic, leading to the conclusion that these largely Holarctic families are originally Panantarctic. From the evidence given it is concluded that many but probably not all major groups of the Jungermanniae may have originated in this Panantarctica (Gondwanaland). The recent overwhelmingly "in phase" data corroborating the theory of continental drift, plus the relatively late times for separation of the Australian-Tasmanian-New Zealand area from Antarctica (ca. 40-60 m.y. ago; perhaps somewhat earlier in the case of New Zealand) suggest much of the dispersal (of older, unisexual taxa) may have been overland during late Mesozoic and early Tertiary times. Ranges of some taxa on islands near or on the Mid-Atlantic and Indian-Ocean ridges, islands which vary from 1-20 million years in age, clearly indicate some taxa (especially bisexual ones) may have wider powers of spore-dispersal than sometimes assumed. Present evidence does not, often, allow us to distinguish between ancient "overland" dispersal, and more recent dispersal via spores.
10.2307/1218592|It is plant taxonomists, not taxa, that make distinctions between the formal disciplines of ecology, evolution and systematics. For populations and species in the real world, however, there is an integrating attribute: discontinuity leading to isolation. How the ecologist can contribute to the study of disjunction is the central theme of this paper. The several areas of interaction between ecology, systematics and evolution are discussed. The contribution of ecological approaches to problems in taxonomy is illustrated with recent examples in each of the following subject areas: genecology (ecotypic variation), ecology of isolating mechanisms, ecological influences on hybridization and polyploidy, ecological bases for diversification in plant genera and families, and the use of ecological data in plant taxonomy.
10.2307/1218671| Many of the diverse floral characteristics used by taxonomists in assessing relationships among taxa represent adaptations to specific pollinators or pollinating methods. Therefore, the diversity of reproductive methods that occurs within a phylad has a strong influence on the number of taxa that are generally recognized in the phylad. Such evolutionary phenomena as convergence and adaptive radiation of floral patterns influence the taxonomic status of various phylads or the relationships that are seen among them. Incompatibility systems are generally unassociated with morphological distinctions, but are of practical importance in crossing programs designed to test the presence and nature of genetic isolation between species, since an unawareness of their existence may lead to erroneous taxonomic conclusions. Similarly, unilateral incompatibility is discussed in relation to certain practicalities in hybridizaton programs. Morphological features associated with dioecism and heterostyly are disscussed as a generally overlooked source of potentially very useful taxonomic characters. The importance of adaptations to different pollinators as a basis of interspecific isolating mechanisms is stressed, as are the possible positive evolutionary (and taxonomic) consequences of a breakdown in this isolation. Floral and other characters associated with autogamy are discussed and examples are given where the relationships of autogamous taxa are uncertain because of their highly specialized reduced flowers. It is suggested that taxonomists should make an attempt to understand the reproductive methods of the plants with which they work, since such an understanding will strengthen the foundation upon which taxonomic judgments are made. 
10.2307/1218672|Recent developments in chemosystematics are reviewed with the conclusion that micromolecular data (essentially monomeric compounds such as flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, amino acids, etc.) will prove most useful in resolving taxonomic problems at the generic level and lower while macromolecular data (polymeric compounds such as RNA, DNA, proteins, etc.) will prove most useful in resolving phyletic problems at the generic level and higher. Examples are given in which the two kinds of data have contributed to the resolution of such problems. Particular emphasis is placed upon the use of gas liquid chromatography in micromolecular studies, especially at the populational level. It is also concluded that protein-band data and isoenzyme studies, as determined electrophoretically, because of the difficulty in establishing homology in the former and because of exceptional polymorphism in the latter, will be useful primarily at the specific level or lower. Developments have lagged in the application of serology and DNA hybridization to evolutionary problems in higher plant systematics and it appears that the most fruitful approach for unraveling phylogenetic problems at the familial level or higher is that of animo-acid sequence studies of metabolically important enzymes such as cytochrome c.
10.2307/1218673|The extracellular metabolic end-products that accumulate on the outer surface of the cell walls of the fungal hyphae in lichens have long been used in taxonomy. Although most morphological species of lichens are chemically uniform with regard to these substances, many others are differentiated into chemical races having distinct geographic distributions. The commonest type of chemical variation, noted in hundreds of examples, is a replacement series of the main constituent substances of the medulla. The fact that major chemical races in apparently sexually reproducing, morphologically uniform or nearly uniform lichens maintain their complete identity in places where they are sympatric suggests that such races are perhaps better regarded as distinct species. Such interpretation is further supported by the recent demonstration that where six such races are sympatric in an environmentally telescoped maritime community in Britain, the chemically different plants select different habitats, resulting in conspicuous zonation but with no alteration of plant characteristics where zones overlap. Examples of the use of lichen chemistry in genus-level taxonomy are also given.
10.2307/1218674|The first serious flora written in America (Thomas Walter's "Flora Caroliniana," 1788) was essentially a local flora, written by a plantation owner. Many subsequent early botanists were diverted away from local floras by the need of a general work (Thomas Nuttall, Amos Eaton, John Torrey, Asa Gray), but important local ones were also written (W. P. C. Barton, Jacob Bigelow, William Darlington). A majority of early botanists were Doctors of Medicine; smaller numbers were teachers, or belonged to other professions (e.g. Stephen Elliott, banker). Tabulation of state and local floras listed in Jackson's "Guide to the Literature of Botany" (1881) and Blake and Atwood's "Geographical Guide to Floras of the World, Part I" (1942), and of works published since the 1939 closing date for entries in the latter, shows that more and better ones are being produced in mid 20th Century than ever before in American history, but coverage of the country is still very incomplete and uneven. Despite current dominance of non-floristic approaches to systematics, of other fields than systematics within botany, and of physical sciences over botany itself, the immediate future is likely to see continuation of the trend to more and better floras. The possible future history of local floras will end only if the entire human race is transported into outer space. General cultural conditions, economic factors, and world political problems will be important influences, but the surprising vigor of the anima naturaliter botanica in the face of difficulties in recent decades augurs very well for its future.
10.2307/1218675|If the taxonomic system is to reflect the totality of similarities and differences among organisms, it must have an evolutionary foundation. Too rigid an adherence to the rule of monophylesis, however, would wreak havoc with our system. Similarities due to evolutionary parallelism provide some evidence of relationship, because the greater the genetic and phenetic similarity between two groups, the greater the likelihood that they will produce similar mutations, have similar evolutionary potentialities, and undergo parallel evolutionary change. A workable taxonomic system can provide only a muddy reflection of phylogeny. If the evolutionary diversification of any large taxonomic group were profoundly influenced by the nature of the supply of mutations, if the supply of mutations differed in the various subgroups, if the fixation of many of these mutations did not depend wholly on survival value, and if the evolutionary barriers between different ecologic niches or adaptive zones were in general low, then we might expect that group to show ecological and adaptive correlations most commonly at the lower taxonomic levels such as genera and species, whereas the higher taxa would tend to embrace a wide array of ecological types. These ecologically varied higher taxa would tend to be characterized in large part by features of doubtful adaptive significance, and the critical taxonomic characters for many of them would be so beset by exceptions that the recognition, characterization, and definition of the groups would often be difficult. The taxonomic pattern of the angiosperms, especially the dicotyledons, is precisely that which would be expected under the foregoing set of postulates.
10.2307/1218676|The angiosperms are treated as a division Magnoliophyta, with two classes, the Magnoliatae (dicotyledons) and Liliatae (monocotyledons). Takhtajan's six subclasses of Magnoliatae are accepted with only minor alteration. These are the Magnoliidae, Hamamelidae, Caryophyllidae, Dilleniidae, Rosidae, and Asteridae. His four subclasses of Liliatae -- the Alismatidae, Arecidae, Commelinidae, and Liliidae -- are also accepted, but with a major transfer of the Zingiberales, Bromeliales, Juncales, and Cyperaceae from the Liliidae to the Commelinidae. The aquatic ancestry of the Liliatae has had a profound influence on the subsequent evolutionary history of the group. Loss of cambium, loss of vessels (except for some vestiges in the root), and reduction of the leaf to a phyllode are all probably associated with the ancestral aquatic habitat. The fact that habital differences are often taxonomically more important among the monocots than they usually are among the dicots reflects the evolutionary difficulties under which monocots labor. The single cotyledon of monocots is considered to have arisen by lateral fusion of two, followed by reduction of one of the lobes, and the sheath-blade structure of the leaves is considered to reflect the cotyledonary structure.
10.2307/1218677|Since the precise origins of a type or critical collection and its subsequent history at the hands of persons who have annotated a specimen are critical in making taxonomic decisions, closer attention must be made to historical problems. Suggestions are offered apropos of four problems: (1) locating the literature, (2) locating the type, (3) establishing the type-locality as precisely as possible, and (4) deciphering handwritings on labels. Library details include the (a) need to verify dates of issue, (b) need to check translations which may provide valuable annotations and supplement the original, (c) need to search for ancillary materials which may be nursery catalogues or other ephemera: these may help fix the date of a discovery or give other taxonomic history. In the search for the type the life and travels of an author may be important. An author like A. A. Heller who kept a personal herbarium, but who moved from city to city, or an author like A. W. Chapman who assembled two or more herbaria, each destined to lodge in a different institution, presents special problems. Destruction of a type necessitates the search for an isotype. This search should not be forsaken without a thorough canvass of collections which may contain an isotype. Precision in fixing a type locality may be lost when insufficient attention is paid to the collector's travels. Endemic taxa, for example, restricted to certain soils, or to particular geographic features may be involved. Travel narratives of other members of an expedition may also elucidate obscure place names which are possibly wanting on modern maps. Sequences of collector's numbers may or may not be significant in tracing routes since one must consider the possibility of mixed collection numbers. Handwriting is an important consideration, and there are several guides kept by prominent herbaria, and some maintain sample files. The practice of copying collection labels with each exchange of a specimen often has involved miscopying or abbreviating the original information, and so presents a common source of erroneous records. It must be recognized that handwriting modifies during the lifetime of the collector, and this necessitates checking against letters or contemporary holographic records. Fallacious and inaccurate conclusions may follow hasty research.
10.2307/1218678|In response to skeptics who feel that the contribution of paleobotany to phylogeny is minimal, I have presented a number of examples where the fossil plant record has played an important role in demonstrating origins and relationships of various plant groups. Work on Precambrian thallophytes is one area where knowledge of earliest plant forms is taking on a definite form. New finds on the origin and evolution of Devonian land plants are presenting a clearer picture of early vascular plant evolution. Existence of such plants as the Progymnospermopsida has made it possible to understand the steps leading to the origin of gymnosperms. We now have important new knowledge concerning the evolution of the seed habit, as well as subsequent seed plant evolution. These are but a few examples of the contribution of paleobotany to phylogeny. This increasing sophistication in understanding phylogenetic events is indispensible for a system of plant classification that reflects relationships. Such a system of classification, I maintain, is much more meaningful than any other.
10.2307/1218824| The taxonomic entities called genus and species are, though very much in use, still vaguely defined. Through the study of different modern authors one can approximate their meaning to a sufficient degree of precision to allow the formulation of a mathematical model. The species will be defined as the set of all genetically similar individuals, barring differences that reside at the allele level. We will then consider the "species such as in nature" to be the union of certain vital neighborhoods in a multi-dimensional space, the said intervals obviously being those that correspond to the given species. This concept will be used to define, with an evolutionary tree pattern, the genus. The genus will then be the set of species, linked by monophyletism, that form an evolutionary peak in the space of "conditions of life". /// [French] Les entits taxonomiques que l'on appelle genre et espce sont encore sujettes  l'arbitraire, quoique ces mots soient dans la bouche de tous les biologistes. En se basant sur les rflexions d'auteurs modernes, il est cependant possible d'en venir  des dfinitions de genre et d'espce qui cernent d'assez prs le problme, dans l'tat actuel des connaissances, et de btir sur elles un modle mathmatique. L'espce sera d'abord dfinie comme l'ensemble des individus gntiquement similaires,  des diffrences d'allles prs. Puis l'on considrera qu'cologiquement, l'espce telle qu'elle existe dans la nature sera l'union des "voisinages vitaux", dans un espace multi-dimensionnel, de ces individus gntiquement similaires. Cette notion sera utile dans la dfinition du genre, qui sera base sur le modle de l'arbre volutif. Le genre est dfini comme l'ensemble des espces, relies par monophyltisme, qui, dans l'espace multi-dimensionnel des conditions de vie, forment un agglomrat appel un sommet volutif. 
10.2307/1218825|A 'large' family of flowering plants is here defined as a family for which a taxonomist would need ten or more years to complete a monographic treatment, or a revision for one of the major floras. The number of such families increases because of the increase in materials and secondary literature. The only possible way of completing monographs or revisions of such major groups seems to be by means of team-work.
10.2307/1218826| In October, 1967, a symposium entitled "Systematics of the family Gramineae" was held in Kbe, Japan, as a part of the 32nd Annual Meeting of the Botanical Society of Japan. Besides the introductory remarks given by the present author, the following three papers were presented: Systematic significance of underground organs of grass seedlings, by K. Hoshikawa; Amino acid pattern of grass seed and systematics, by H. Taira; Temperature responses and systematics of the Gramineae. by S. Kawanabe. All these three speakers have their own field of research outside of systematics, but they have attempted to combine the results of their investigations with systematics. The present paper aims to discuss the positions of these contributions in modern grass systematics. 
10.2307/1218827| Some of the taxonomic problems concerning continuous variation referred to by Bcher (1967) are exemplified in the snow gum of south-eastern Australia, Eucalyptus pauciflora Sieb. ex Spreng. A taxonomic study of this species was carried out in connection with an investigation of altitudinal variation in the Brindabella Range, near Canberra, where continuous though not pure stands occur between 4,000 and just over 6,000 feet (Green 1967). The species is here discussed over its whole range of distribution in south-eastern Australia, although special emphasis is placed on the forms considered to occur in the study area. 
10.2307/1218828|Recent taxonomic treatments of the cultivated species of Capsicum are discussed and divergent opinions on the names to be employed for some of these demonstrated. It is concluded that five species are widely cultivated and that the correct names for these are C. pubescens R. & P., C. annuum L., C. baccatum L., C. frutescens L., and C. chinense Jacq.
10.2307/1218829|The term isopleths is proposed as a general term for specimens bearing the same collector's or collection number. Examples are given of isopleths of holotypes which are not isotypes, i.e. which were not seen by the original author of the name in question.
10.2307/1218830|New chromosome counts based on collections of Winteraceae have strengthened the conclusion, suggested by morphological and anatomical study, that the two Sections (Tasmannia and Drimys) traditionally treated in the genus Drimys J. R. & G. Forst. are very distinct and merit full generic status. Consequently Tasmannia R. Br. ex DC. is herewith reinstated and a number of required new combinations are proposed.
10.2307/1218831| The determination of the species of the moss genus Plagiothecium Br., Schimp. et Gmb. is difficult owing to the great morphological variability of these taxa. With a view to smooth things down for the bryologist and to reduce errors in identification, Fisher's discriminant functions (1951) are applied to seven belgian species of Plagliothecium: P. latebricola, P. laetum, P. curvifolium, P. denticulatum, P. sylvaticum, P. succulentum, P. roeseanum. The functions are based upon five quantitative characters concerned in the classification of that moss genus: length of the leaf, of the median leaf cells and of the four cells long propagula, width of the leaf and of the median leaf cells. From the measurements of these morphological features, it is easy to determine any specimen with a minimum probability of mistakes. 
10.2307/1218832|Vitaliana primuliflora Bertol. is based on the same type as Primula vitaliana L. Linnaeus in Sp. Pl. 143 (1753) included two geographical elements in his Primula vitaliana, one, from Italy based on a plate of Sesler and the other from the Pyrenees on a specimen in the Burser Herbarium. Recent authors have typified the name differently. It is proposed here that the name Primula vitaliana L. and therefore Vitaliana primuliflora Bertol. be based on Sesler's plate.
10.2307/1218465|A fairy story on biosystematics making the point that there do not exist in nature groups of individuals which must be grouped in only one way as objective, uncontestable species. On the other hand, species are not purely subjective groupings, carved out of an amorphous welter of varying populations. The organized systems of populations, forming an irregular variation pattern, is characterized by modes of similar variants separated by larger or smaller gaps of discontinuity. The best system for any group is one synthesized from data of all kinds.
10.2307/1218466|It is almost unanimously agreed that the Ranales s.l. (= Polycarpicae) constitute the universal basic group for at least all dicotyledons. Cronquist, for example, derives from them the two principal lines of his system, his Rosalean branch and his Guttiferalean branch. Attention is called to the fact that phytochemical evidence is inconsistent with such a view: some alkaloids highly characteristic for the Polycarpicae (protoaporphines, aporphines as well as berberin and other quaternary bases) are absent from both the Rosales and the Guttiferales. They are present, however, in the Rutaceae, other chemical as well as morphological features of which support the conjecture of a direct link with the Polycarpicae. On the other hand, the Rosalean and Guttiferalean branches (at least their more primitive members) coincide in the possession of biogenetically obviously related trihydroxylated phenolic substances like ellagic acid, gallic acid, myricetin, and leucodelphinidin. These substances are absent from the Polycarpicae. A similar pattern of distribution is exhibited by the iridoid substances (aucubin etc.), which constitute in all probability a homologous series of plant products. Also, morphological characters are mentioned which link the Rosiflorae with the Guttiferales but remove them from the Polycarpicae. On this basis the idea is advanced that the Polycarpicae represent an odd lateral branch of the evolution of the dicotyledons which appears wholly fixed and has remained primitive in different respects, and which has only given rise to a limited number of more modern groups like Papaverales (s. str.) and Rutaceae. The Rosiflorae and the Guttiferales must have had a common origin, but one different from the Polycarpicae; it is from them that most of the choripetalous and all sympetalous groups were derived.
10.2307/1218467|Serially dependent attributes arise when a primary attribute controls a string of secondary attributes, so that the system takes the form (X or not-X; if X, then Y or not-Y, Z or not-Z; otherwise question inapplicable). Kendrick (1965) pointed out that in numerical classifications, unless steps are taken to apply differential weighting to primary and secondary attributes, the secondaries may over-ride the primaries, and that this may result in unacceptable classifications. His suggestions are re-examined in the light of modern metric and information-statistic programs; it is concluded that the suggestions are numerically sound, but require modification in the context of modern programs. Essentially, the revised suggestions consist in reducing the contribution of secondary attributes by dividing by the number of secondaries in the string, and then taking the number of secondaries as zero when consolidating into an overall similarity measure.
10.2307/1218468|It is shown that a group may be made up of subgroups all of which are relatively compact or homogeneous. Another group may have one or more subgroups scattered among comparatively diverse members. These scattered sets are called here sibling groups. The possibility that the ranks with the prefix 'sub-' arose to meet an unwritten need to accommodate sibling groups is suggested. Their use for this is briefly examined. Giving the same rank to the sibling gorup and its allies is shown to be misleading. A simple nomenclatural device is proposed to show the presence of sibling groups.
10.2307/1218469|A new approach for sampling taxonomic circumscriptions by estimating intrataxon variability yielded some noteworthy data. The data are presented for the phenetic distances computed between plant specimens which had been determined in the classical taxonomic manner. The paper complements one to appear in the American Journal of Botany in which summary statistics support the hypothesis that the phenetic distances (phenetic affinities) and their variances can quantify taxonomic circumscriptions by providing estimates of the similarity between various members of the same taxa. The names of the taxa are listed and the phenetic distances between specimens of a large number of taxa at various levels in the family and the respective variances are presented in nine tables.
10.2307/1218470| Chemical studies on the type specimens of species of the lichen genus Alectoria Ach. have been used to clarify the nomenclature of several species. The following nomenclatural changes are made: A. capillaris (Ach.) Cromb. (= A. implexa auct. mult., non (Hoffm.) Nyl.; barbatolic acid), A. implexa (Hoffm.) Nyl. (= A. zopfii Asah., A. catharinae Rs.; psoromic acid), A. pseudofuscescens Gyeln. (= A. subtilis Mot., A. norsticta Mot.; norstictic acid). The identity of A. furcellata R. Sant., A. patagonica R. Sant., and A. subsarmentosa Stirt. and the nomenclature of A. nidulifera Norrl. ex Nyl. have also been investigated. 
10.2307/1218471|In the 1780's J. P. B. von Rohr (1737-1793) intensively studied the cottons of the West Indies. His observations are recorded in a book that not only is a basic source of knowledge of the cottons of the 18th century, but which also provides the descriptions used by C. S. Rafinesque as the basis for 38 names of species and varieties in Gossypium. The present paper reports observations on 52 specimens of Gossypium collected by von Rohr and preserved in the Copenhagen Museum. From these specimens, lectotypes have been chosen for 12 of the Rafinesquian names (Table 2). The remaining names (Table 1) must thereupon be typified by the published descriptions. Lectotype species are also designated for the three subgenera of Gossypium published by Rafinesque (Table 3), the earliest available names in that rank. The presence of symptoms of the bacterial blight disease, caused by Xanthomonas malvacearum (E. F. Smith) Dows., on two of von Rohr's specimens, is noted as perhaps the earliest known occurrence of this disease. A review of the nomenclature of the kidney cottons is appended.
10.2307/1218472|The new names, epithets and combinations published by Gandoger in his "Flora Europae" are not validly published because: 1. 'genera' are subordinated to genera in the sense of the "International Code of Botanical Nomenclature." 2. 'Species' are subordinated to species in that same sense. 3. names of second category genera are used as the first part of binary combinations. 4. epitheta of second category species are used as the second part of binary combinations. 5. names and epithets of unequal rank are used as the first part of binary combinations thus creating the impression of genera of the first, second and third order (category). All these names are inadmissible because not validly published as provided for by Articles 5, 12, 23 and 33 of the Code.
10.2307/1218473| A biographical sketch of the botanical activities of the Swiss physician Frdric Allamand (1735-?). Allamand visited Suriname in 1756 and 1760 and put his botanical annotations of those trips at the disposal of Linnaeus. In later years, when in St. Petersburg, he sent the remainder of his collections (part of them had been lost) to Linnaeus. 
10.2307/1218474|Fewer than half of the Scott-Elliot specimens from the northern boundary of Sierra Leone originated in Sierra Leone itself. The greater part of his itinerary, and his collecting localities, lay in the French territory of the present Republic of Guinea. In consequence, the type localities of some species based upon Scott-Elliot specimens are properly in Guinea, and not in Sierra Leone as stated in the Flora of West Tropical Africa.

10.2307/1218377|A review of some of the most recent developments in systematic biology. The present abundance of symposia in the field reflects the systematists' attempt to master an explosive development of knowledge in which many techniques and methods are used which formerly found little, if any, application in comparative biology. The information challenge is discussed with reference to modern processing methods and to abstracting. A shift in systematics from direct and visual characters to indirect, non-visual data is apparent in many fields. The relation between numbers of known and possibly unknown taxa is illustrated by means of examples from the recent literature showing the rate of growth of our knowledge in various groups. The contributions by ultrastructural research, chemosystematics and molecular systematics are projected towards the future; other modern approaches in systematics (from ethology, ecology, micropaleontology, caryology, genecology) are mentioned briefly. The term biosystematics is used for evolutionary systematics of all living beings in the widest sense.
10.2307/1218378|The results of research concerning 87 mostly herbal shoots permitted us to divide a complex of essentially African Aristida's into two Linnaean species and sub-specific units. The criteria of differentiation proposed were submitted to statistical tests. The seeds were brought to Marseille in order to cultivate them in a homogeneous environment (greenhouse and botanical garden). This latitudinal translation of seeds over a distance of 2300 to 2800 kilometers in a single hemisphere eliminates unstable specific characteristics retaining only those adequately differentiating the taxa. The ecological upheaval (Bourreil 1967-b1) affecting the same lineages, permitted us to establish a biometrical test value of homogeneity (t = Z/Sd) for one characteristic, by comparing the averages between the native and the cultivated samples. This value, resulting from the maximal plasticity of the taxon, can be compared to a standard test for the purposes of our work. The same calculations applied to the herbarium samples give a value clearly superior to that of this standard, thus guaranteeing the specific differentiation. The results show the advantage of making use of ecological and statistical criteria in taxonomic research.
10.2307/1218379|The specimen of Martynia annua [Houstoun in Martyn] L. in the Linnaean herbarium does not correspond with the original description of that species but is instead a specimen of Proboscidea louisianica (Miller) Thellung. Examination of the nomenclatural history of these two species, which are the type species of the genera Martynia and Proboscidea, indicates that the names can be maintained in their current usage. No type specimens were indicated by the describing authors, but illustrations provided by them can serve as lectotypes.
10.2307/1218380| The correct name of the common western North American lichen species which has been known as Letharia californica (Lv. ex Nyl.) Hue is Letharia columbiana (Nutt.) Thomson. 
10.2307/1218381|The basionym of Oleandra articulata (Sw.) Presl, namely Aspidium articulatum Sw. must be typified as indicated by Maxon (1914) thus continuing current usage. Morton's arguments (1968) to change the lectotype are rejected.
10.2307/1218382|A specimen from the Miller herbarium (BM) is selected as the neotype of Sisyrinchium bermudiana L. Another specimen from the same herbarium is designated as the lectotype of S. angustifolia Miller. Photographs of both specimens are provided.
10.2307/1218383|The genus Grammosciadium as circumscribed by Boissier (1844, 1872) should not be divided by splitting of Caropodium and Stenodiptera. A review of the nomenclature of the seven species is given, followed by a key to the four sections.
10.2307/1218915|This paper presents suggested sequential steps for biological species delimitation, applying several taximetric computer-aided methods. The process constitutes two phases: 1) synthesizing all the available intrinsic phenotypic evidence, and extrinsic geographic and ecological evidence, thereby developing a "preliminary delimitation", and 2) designing cytogenetic and related investigations to discover / confirm intrinsic isolating mechanisms, thereby ratifying, modifying, supplementing or replacing the preliminary delimitation and giving shape to the final species delimitation. Such delimitations developed by methodical assimilation of the pertinent evidence, with the aid of electronic data processing equipment, will inspire much higher confidence levels than delimitations based on traditional methods. Cytogenetic and other evidence of intrinsic isolating mechanisms are not easily applicable in cases such as asexual species; in others, such as fossil species, it is impossible to apply these tests. But in the vast majority of sexually reproducing species cytogenetic evidence is significant in the context of the modern biological species concept. However, we do not have this evidence for most of the plant kingdom, and it will be slow in becoming available because cytogenetic methods are expensive in time, effort and money. Consequently, we develop classifications without the support of this evidence to meet the immediate needs. The methods outlined in this paper aid in developing, in the absence of cytogenetic evidence, delimitations which not only inspire greater confidence levels compared to the ones based on traditional methods, but also provide invaluable working hypotheses for efficiently designing cytogenetic investigations.
10.2307/1218916|A comparison is made between phenetic diagrams of the 13 genera of the tribe Aloineae (Liliaceae) based on the "intuition method" and on the use of a computer. The overall pattern is rather similar but the differences (especially that of the status of the genus Lomatophyllum) are a means of drawing attention to the weaknesses in the traditional method of assessing affinities. These differences force the systematist to look closer at his materials and methods and stimulate the pursuit of better botany.
10.2307/1218917|It is questionable whether an author of a scientific publication has the right to designate an arbitrary other person as the author of the name of a new taxon if it is clear that this other person is not a publishing author in the sense of Article 46 of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. The citation of "author's" names should be restricted to the true "publishing author".
10.2307/1218918|A further clarification of the author's interpretation of the problem of hetero-versus homobasidiomycetes in view of the counterproposals published by P. H. B. Talbot (Taxon 17: 620-628. 1968). The author's reclassification of the heterobasidiomycetous fungi (Taxon 17: 118-127. 1968) is upheld.
10.2307/1218919|The genus Tabebuia (Bignoniaceae) is now accepted, much as by Bentham and Hooker, in a very different sense than originally proposed by de Candolle. This paper traces its changing generic delimitations from artificial ones based on number of calyx lobes to biologically more meaningful ones based on vegetational as well as floral characteristics.
10.2307/1218920|Because of the great difficulties associated with the determination of the correct names of infrageneric taxa of vascular plants, the development of the concepts of subgenus and section (sectio) and the use of these terms are traced from the time of Linnaeus to the mid-nineteenth century. It is argued that the year 1805, which marked the mass introduction of subgenera (by Persoon) and of sections (by A. P. de Candolle) should be adopted as the starting point for the valid publication of names of taxa of vascular plants between the ranks of genus and species. (See Taxon 17: 659. December, 1968, for the formal proposal for the adoption of 1 January 1805 as starting point). A number of nomenclaturally important taxonomic works and floras of the nineteenth century which have become sources of confusion in regard to subgeneric and sectional names are also considered more or less in chronological sequence. Included are works by Persoon, S. F. Gray, Mertens, W. D. J. Koch, Dumortier, Link, Reichenbach, Torrey, A. Gray, Endlicher, K. Koch, Dippel, and von Post & Kuntze. It is concluded that subgeneric and sectional names must be interpreted in terms of the word actually used to denote the rank of the taxon to which the name is applied and not in terms of the author's concept of infrageneric categories: what the author actually "did" is of greater importance than his guessed "intentions". Hence, although Endlicher, for example, possibly intended to recognize several infrageneric ranks, his failure to indicate the rank of his generic subdivisions has to be decisive.
10.2307/1218921|Gymnocarpium Newm. should not be considered an orthographic variant of Gymnocarpos, Forsk. being different etymologically and sufficiently different in spelling and pronunciation not to be confused, since the genera concerned belong to different major groups. The lectotype of Gymnocarpium must be Polypodium dryopteris L. and not G. robertianum as proposed by Holttum. Phegopteris is a legitimate name and not superfluous when published.
10.2307/1218922|The author does not agree with M. E. P. K. Fidalgo's replacement of Hexagonia mori Pollini per Fr. as the type of Hexagonia Pollini per Fr. by Hexagonia crinigera Fr. Her arguments in favour of this substitution are scrutinized below and found to be untenable. The correct name for Hexagonia sensu K. Fid. is Scenidium (Kl.) ex O.K. For Hexagonia sensu Bond. & S. (not validly published) the new name Apoxona Donk is proposed.
10.2307/1218923|The generic name Medicago L. should by typified by M. radiata L. and not by M. sativa L. Acceptance of specimens in the Linnaean herbarium as types of certain Medicago species should not be 'automatic' but based on an analysis of each particular case showing that the specimen in question is indeed in accordance with the protologue and not a later addition to the herbarium.
10.2307/1218924|Hybrid formulas should only be used for indication of F<sub>1</sub> hybrids between different taxa. They should definitely not be used for relatively well established taxa even if those taxa are of hybrid origin, because of the unlikelihood of repetition of exactly all the conditions and all factors that have been involved in their creation, and therefore the improbability of their creation de novo.
10.2307/1218925|In 1910 Martelli published in Webbia vol. 3 an alphabetical listing of all binomials in the genus Freycinetia. This is now outdated, and many species have been described since then. Also many taxonomic changes have been made and will be made in the present writer's monographic studies. A chronological listing up to date can present in the briefest form many of the results of such work and can serve as a constant reference in subsequent numbers of the series, of which this list is the tenth. Total binomials to date: 261. Provisionally accepted species: 198 (including 10 ined., in sched.). Nomina nuda: 20. Species of other genera misplaced in Freycinetia: 2. Homonyms: 7. Illegitimate names: 6. Specific epithets originally published in other genera but pertaining to Freycinetia: 2.
10.2307/1218928|The monumental "Flora URSS" comprises 30 volumes and 2 separate indexes. Vol. I was published in the end of 1933, while the entire publication was completed in August, 1964. The "Flora URSS" numbers about 22000 pages containing the descriptions of all the higher plants of the Soviet Union (except Bryophyta), viz. 160 families, 1676 genera and 17520 species. Besides, many widespread cultivated species are described, although not listed. Over 10% of the species listed in the "Flora URSS" are new to science. The work is illustrated with 10000 original drawings on 1250 plates. The article deals with the following information about the "Flora URSS": the scientific characteristics of the work (the concepts of race, species and phylogenetic series; the scope and distribution of the material, the area embraced etc.); the general evaluation; the status and the prospects of the development of the Komarov's concept of species, etc. A special section is devoted to some results ensuing from the accounts of taxa published in the "Flora URSS". The data on the number of genera and species of each of the families described are presented in tables and so are the data on endemic genera and on the genera established by Soviet botanists.
10.2307/1217906|Biosystematics should not develop into a superior synthetic science; it should deliver material for the modern taxonomic synthesis. It should not only continue to produce chromosome numbers, but also to provide taxonomists with information about chromosomal behaviour during meiosis, ecotypical variation, sterility barriers, etc. However, it should not only act as a supporting branch of science, but it should keep its own face, stamped by experimental work. Specialisation in the field of evolution in plants is needed, thereby obtaining a deeper understanding of variation and evolution in relation to the environment. Divergent as well as convergent evolution must be understood just as well as the phenomenon of 'adaptation'.
10.2307/1217907|The necessity of microscopic examination of Composite flowers is reviewed. Results of observations include listing of generic distinctions for Stevia, Brickellia, and Liatris; description of a distinctive hair type in Flaveria; confirmation of characteristic pollen type in the Vernonieae; recognition of a characteristically keeled anther appendage in the Helenieae-Heliantheae complex; discovery of distinctive characters in anther appendages and exothecial cells of Eupatorieae, Astereae, Senecioneae, and Inuleae; discovery of characters of the anther appendage and exothecial cells that help show generic and sectional limits in Tridax; and description of distinctive corolla lobe structure in Inula, Marshallia, Flaveria, and Melampodium.
10.2307/1217908|The criteria for maximal efficiency in identification keys are briefly reviewed. Some techniques for meeting these criteria in a system using numerically coded data are described. The general structure of a key-forming program written for an I.C.L. 1301 computer is given. The performance of this program using a small set of data is briefly reported and some desirable refinements are noted. The results of this study were generally satisfactory and the system shows promise in the rapid production of keys for a variety of special uses.
10.2307/1217909|In 1891 W. A. Kellerman came to The Ohio State University as Professor of Botany, which position he held until his death in Guatemala on March 8, 1908. From January through March of the years 1905 through 1908, Kellerman made four collecting trips to Guatemala on which parasitic fungi and vascular plant material were secured. Prior to the 1908 trip Dr. Kellerman's Tropical School of Botany was organized with its first session scheduled for the winter of 1908. New taxa were described from Kellerman's Guatemalan collections, of which twenty-one fungus and forty-one vascular plant taxa are known. Itineraries and maps were constructed for each trip based predominantly on 1152 specimen labels in The Ohio State University Herbarium. The information from these itineraries will enable herbaria that have inadequately labeled material to supplement specimen labels with pertinent information of either place or date of collection.
10.2307/1217910|A review of the main results of the discussions on botanical nomenclature at the Eleventh International Botanical Congress at Seattle, 22-24 August 1969. The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature remains practically unchanged. Minor amendments include a restriction of the phenomenon of 'automatically created tautonyms' (to be called autonyms), a further precision of the rules concerning names of hybrids, and a loosening of the rule governing superfluous names.
10.2307/1217913|Some ideas about future problems of Botanical Gardens. -- Botanical Gardens should lay out special "conservation departments" in order to prevent the extinction of plant species. This program of conservation needs international cooperation. Conditions for success are regional specialization, restriction of the number of species in each garden, and utmost care in cultivation.
10.2307/1217914|Criticisms of the quality of Seed Lists issued by Botanic Gardens, have been directed towards failures either to identify accurately the seed offered, or to ensure its viability or to provide information on its origin. These shortcomings can be remedied only by spending more time on each seed sample than at present. One way of gaining this time is to prolong seed viability to a maximum by providing good storage conditions. This avoids the necessity for frequently repeated collections of seed with the advantage that documentation on any particular collection remains relevant for a long period. No single storage condition suits all species and experiments at Kew are directed towards establishing optimum needs of different species. with the aim of maintaining viability in store of seventy-five percent or more of the species involved for at least ten to fifteen years. This would allow the establishment of a bank of seed which could be built up from year to year with time for adequate documentation of every species.
10.2307/1217917|A critical reconsideration of the lectotypification of Medicago by Scofield (1908) has revealed that the designation of Medicago radiata L. as lectotype was not done correctly according to the Code when retroactively applied. The next choice, however, Medicago sativa L. by Britton and Brown (1913) is in accordance with the Code and must be followed. According to the combined criteria by Urban (1873) and Baum (1968) for delimitation of Medicago and Trigonella the choice of either of the two lectotype species will not affect the nomenclatural status of the generic name Medicago.
10.2307/1217944|A breach exists between the biosystematists, who deal with evolutionary processes, and the more classical 'conservative' taxonomists, who deal with the endproducts. While dealing with processes, the problem of a generalized species concept (referring in fact to the end products) is hardly relevant to the study of biosystematics. Biosystematics can be successful only when it overcomes the gaps between its approaches "at the cross-roads" to genetics and to systematics; biosystematics can thus become a true integral part of general systematics.
10.2307/1217945|The main pillars of plant evolution are the populations of normal species -- diploid, sexual, and outbreeding. These basic stocks represent the diversity which has resulted from millions of years of phylogenetic change. Hybrids have occasionally appeared, but most have been sterile or ill-adapted. Polyploids, apomicts, inbreeders, and hybrids are common today and we have no reason to believe that they did not occur even among early land plants. The fact, however, that normal species with normal life cycles still prevail today strongly indicates that such plants have always been responsible for the primary thrust of evolution. A kind of evolutionary noise is produced through the repeated origin of populations with deleteriously modified life cycles in which the advantages of diploidy, sexuality, outbreeding, and species purity are counteracted or cancelled. Such deviations persist for longer or shorter periods while the normal parental stock continues to evolve.
10.2307/1217946|Systematics in a broader sense, relating work in genetics, cytology, pollination, phytochemistry and autecology to the study of evolutionary diversity is very much alive. The need for the term biosystematics to describe this activity has nearly disappeared.
10.2307/1217947|Polyploidy -- both auto- and allo- -- may have dominated the short term evolution of plants because it increases "biochemical versatility" at the primary enzyme level. It actually creates new enzymes with different properties which may extend the range of environments in which normal and successful development may occur.. The new enzymes arise by oligomerisation of related polypeptides produced by related (homoeologous) genes ("hybrid" enzymes). Further study of polyploids may help us understand more about the control of development of the phenotype. There is evidence that the concentration of different isoenzymes changes with the development of tissues. Whether this denotes a causal connection between differentiation and enzyme production, we do not know. But the presence of isoenzymes generated by polyploidy may have allowed such controls to be made more refined and delicate and, thus, helped in ecological success. The determination of the actual amino-acid sequences of such enzymes may, in the future, perhaps contribute to a further understanding of the role of enzyme hybridization for biochemical versatility as a factor in evolution.
10.2307/1217948|Three groups of species can be distinguished in Ranunculus subgenus Batrachium with respect to their leaf form. The first group of species produce only entire leaves and are primarily terrestrial. The second group produce only dissected leaves and all species are submerged aquatics. The third group is heterophyllous and the species produce both entire and divided leaves. The heterophyllous species are adapted to fluctuating water levels. The control of heterophylly is complex. When heterophyllous species are crossed the F<sub>1</sub> offspring are unstable in leaf form, but in the F<sub>2</sub> stable, non-heterophyllous segregants are found which in one jump may be preadapted to terrestrial or submerged conditions. Such decreased epigenetic versatility in hybrids may be important in the evolution of higher plants.
10.2307/1217949|The interaction of divergent genomes as seen in the expression and stability of molecular, physiological and morphological characters may have a profound effect on the fitness of hybrids and bring forward new variations on which selection may act. The evolutionary implications of developmental interactions should prove to be a most rewarding area of inquiry for biosystematists.
10.2307/1217950|When attempts are made to use chromosome characters as independent indicators of the direction of evolution there are few upon which we can depend. On the other hand, if we adopt the synthetic approach and view the chromosome in conjunction with all other characters of organisms then we can indeed determine with greater certainty patterns and pathways of evolution. This is not to equate the chromosome with the other aspects of our plants for we know that chromosomes can inform in ways which neither genes nor phenotypes can, but we require to know not only the way in which genes are assembled and controlled in their inheritance but also their nature as expressed in the chemical and structural phenotypes. We do stand at a cross-road in the application of chromosome studies in plant biosystematics. We have arrived here not because we have been misled by the chromosomes but rather for the reason that they have been so frequently misused and misunderstood.
10.2307/1217951|Claytonia virginica L. has two morphological races and some fifty chromosomal cytotypes. Even though apparently unique this complexity may prove to be of more general importance in the future. Simplicity and the most obvious may not always be Nature's way. In C. virginica growth and development, cytoecology and evolution are in juxtaposition, interacting and awaiting understanding. -- The term biosystematics is now redundant because it has served its purpose to stress the importance of populational studies and cytogenetics for systematics.
10.2307/1217952|Evolutionary studies, one of the main aims of "biosystematics" frequently do not provide the practical information required for classification. A truly phyletic classification is probably unattainable in view of the sheer numbers of organisms systematists have to deal with. Chromosomal changes, however, are often of importance as characters in more conventional taxonomy. The evolutionary direction of the changes is mostly difficult to assess.
10.2307/1217953|The general evolutionary trend in seed plants from trees to perennial and further to annual herbs is paralleled by changes in evolutionary patterns and strategies, shaped by selection and adaptation. With abbreviated generation sequences we find on the average an increasing rate of structural and dysploid change, more genetic isolation and less hybridization, therefore reduced recombination rates, and more and faster evolutionary divergence, coupled with penetration into less favourable and less stabile habitats of the biosphere. Form patterns and "subpatterns" are conditioned by particular modes of reproduction, ecogeographical position, phases of diversification, stagnation or depletion, etc. There are probably no aspects of differentation and variation, which are not selectively coordinated within the framework of such evolutionary patterns and strategies. It will be an important task for future biosystematics to find out more about this by comparative approach and experimental analysis on our way to a better understanding of evolution.
10.2307/1217954|When trying to answer the question whether the effects of genetic drift have evolutionary significance, we must keep in mind that a local population is normally a dynamic system, changing in size, splitting into minor entities, or merging into larger complexes. Most populations have certainly been small for longer or shorter periods, and hence the role of genetic drift must not be neglected. The main role of genetic drift in the complex processes involved in the evolution of plants may be (1) the introduction of genetic factors, which are primarily non-adaptive, (2) the rapid fixation of genetic changes, and (3) the breaking down of rigid gene blocks. Generally speaking a population may be said to be in a selective phase when it is large and in a creative phase when it is small.
10.2307/1217955|Many 'accepted' evolutionary principles would benefit by a re-examination. Rather than focus systematics on interspecific and interpopulation phenomena, the stress should for some time be on intraspecific and intrapopulation problems. Systematists have easily accepted new methodologies, but have been reluctant to assimilate new concepts from sister disciplines. The character and importance of auto- versus alloploidy, the possible reversal of polyploidy, the too easily accepted conclusion of genetic isolation between diploids and tetraploids, the assumption that apomixis is an evolutionary dead end are examples of concepts in need of re-assessment.
10.2307/1217956|The distinctive feature of biosystematics is considered to be its emphasis upon the processes responsible for differences between taxa, rather than the differences themselves. A progress report on our knowledge of these processes can be summarized as follows. With respect to divergent adaptations to different environments, we understand well their genetic basis, and are now ready to analyze them in terms of gene action in development and metabolism. A valuable new tool for this purpose is the study of isozyme differences by gel electrophoresis. With respect to the origin of barriers of reproductive isolation that play a large role in the origin of species, we need further tests of the hypothesis that chromosomal repatterning is established through the action of natural selection, because of the different adaptive values of differing clusters of linked genes. A new hypothesis that also needs testing is that hybrid inviability or sterility may be produced by disharmonious interaction between genes that code for different subunits of the same multimer enzyme. Valuable studies of hybridization are directed toward determining the importance of transgressive segregation in the origin of new characters. Our understanding of differences in karyotypes must now be based upon the demonstrated fact that even diploid organisms contain large stretches of chromosomal DNA that is duplicated in tandem fashion. With respect to major trends of evolution, several examples are cited which indicate that the origin of genera and other higher categories can take place through an extension of the processes mentioned earlier. An important fact in this connection is that many natural populations of plants contain hidden genetic variation with respect to such basic characteristics as the number of parts of a flower.
10.2307/1217957|The rough lemon group was investigated as to its coherence and affinity to the true lemon group. The probable affiliation of the Moroccan rough lemon was scrutinized. The possible origin of the true lemons were studied with the help of genetic and essential oil analysis. A divergence diagram of these groups and of a few old-line species is presented based upon an essential oil discriminant computer analysis.
10.2307/1217959|Studies on type specimens show that the following nomenclatural changes are necessary: A. divergescens Nyl. (= A. acanthodes Hue), A. jubata (L.) Ach. (= A. prolixa sensu Mot.). The identities of A. fusconitida Lamb ex Mot. nom. nud., A. pacifica Stizenb., and Bryopogon hosseusianus Gyeln. are discussed; and A. lanea (Ehrh. ex Hoffm.) Vain. is shown to be a synonym of A. pubescens (L.) R. H. Howe and not the correct name for A. nitidula (Th. Fr.) Vain.. The name A. prolixa (Ach.) Nyl. is rejected in accordance with Articles 69 and 70; the combination A. sarmentosa subsp. vexillifera (Nyl. in Kihlm.) D. Hawksw. stat. nov. is made; and a new variety, A. sulcata var. barbata D. Hawksw. var. nov., is described from Formosa and Sikkim.

10.2307/1217963|Fifteen chromosome counts covering eleven species of Macaranga have 2n = 22, further species have 2n = 20. The significance of these counts is tentatively and briefly discussed.
10.2307/1217964| Pianella Radoii, 1962, according to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (1966), should be considered a later synonym of Salpingoporella Pia, 1918. Consequently, all species which have been assigned to Pianella should be included in the older genus Salpingoporella, which may be defined, essentially, as a Macroporella but with clearly euspondyl arrangement of the branches. /// [German] Pianella Radoii (1962) ist als ein jngeres Synonym des Salpingoporella Pia (1918) anzunehmen. Alle Arten die nach dem Jahre 1962 bis heute als Pianella beschrieben wurden sollten in die ltere Gattung Salpingoporella eingereiht werden, die im Grunde als eine Macroporella aber mit klar ausgeprgter euspondylen Anordnung der Wirtelste aufzufassen ist. 
10.2307/1217965|The study of a 1969 collection of probably the first known pistillate specimens of Archibaccharis prorepens Blake (Compositae) from Guatemala necessitates the transfer of this species to the genus Baccharis as Baccharis prorepens (Blake) Jackson. A redescription as well as morphological, ecological and medicinal notes are included. The chromosome count is reported as n = 9.
10.2307/1219053|The feasibility of using technicians untrained in taxonomy to collect data for use in numerical taxonomic studies was investigated. Two persons independently described twenty-five species of bees (given 6 specimens of each species, 3 of each sex). The results of the analysis of their descriptions were compared with the data of Michener and Sokal (1957). The data were processed using standard numerical taxonomic procedures (standardization of characters, computation of correlation and distance coefficients among species, cluster analysis, principal components analysis and 3-D models). The 3-D models revealed that the generic groupings were not nearly as distinct in the data obtained from the technicians as they were in the original data collected by Michener and Sokal, (M&S, used as a standard for comparison). When the data collected by both technicians were pooled, they yielded much better agreement with the M&S data than either one did by itself. A similar conclusion was derived from examination of the phenograms. While the phenograms made good sense overall, there were many discrepancies between those of the technicians and those of M&S. An analysis of the correlations among the 234 characters from both technicians as well as from M&S enabled a preliminary check for the matches asymptote hypothesis to be made. A cluster analysis of the character correlation matrix revealed that there were no characters which were obvious duplicates (no correlations equal to unity). The same morphological structures were examined but they were described in different ways. Rotation to an oblique simple structure of 17 factors obtained by factor analysis indicated that the character suites described in the three studies shared dimensions of variability. One of the technicians had not described characters loading highly on three of the factors and the M&S data lacked characters loading highly on one of the factors. An important feature of the data is the large number of unique characters (reflecting independent dimensions of variation). These ranged from 18% to 40%. We suspect that these unique characters indicate the presence of taxonomic "noise". The results of this study would seem to imply that characters defined by untrained technicians could lead to acceptable classifications if enough characters are considered. Consequently, we are encouraged about prospects for the eventual automation of the data gathering process in taxonomy.
10.2307/1219054|Six computer programs are discussed as they may be used in the resolution of the inter-relationships among plants.
10.2307/1219055|One new family, Siparunaceae, and one new subfamily, Peumoideae (Monimiaceae), are proposed from a reappraisal of the relationships between the families of the order Laurales and within Monimiaceae s.s. Siparunaceae comprise three genera, namely Siparuna Aubl., Bracteanthus Ducke, and Glossocalyx Benth., which were hitherto included in Monimiaceae; Peumoideae is monotypic. Notes on the characters and affinities of these taxa are given and Monimiaceae are redefined.
10.2307/1219056|The types of the names of taxa above the rank of species cannot, logically, be taxa (species, etc.) but only names of taxa (in the sense of the 'Code'). Accordingly, the type of the name Muscari Miller is the name Muscari botryoides (L.) Miller, as proposed by Britton and Brown in 1913, and is considered to be a neotype. The species currently included in Muscari belong to 4 distinct genera (one of which is new) with 3 additional sections. Full synonymies and latin diagnoses of all these taxa are given. The name Leopoldia Parl. 1845 (non Herb. 1821) is proposed for conservation.
10.2307/1219057|Melanthera panduriformis H. Cassini is designated as the type species of Melanthera Rohr.
10.2307/1219058|The compilospecies B. intermedia (R. Br.) A. Camus introgresses in nature with B. ewartiana (Domin) C. E. Hubbard, B. ischaemum (Linn.) Keng, Capillipedium parviflorum (R. Br.) Stapf, and Dichanthium annulatum (Forssk.) Stapf. The species that contribute towards the variability of the compilospecies are genetically isolated from each other, except across the bridging B. intermedia. Introgression is primarily in the direction of B. intermedia, and it is proposed that such hybrid derivatives be included in the compilospecies. It is suggested that the taxa Bothriochloa O. Kuntze, Capillipedium Stapf and Dichanthium Willemet be combined, with the generic name Dichanthium taking priority.
10.2307/1219059|Achlys californica, a tetraploid, distinct in morphology and ecogeographical distribution from the diploid A. triphylla is described below as a new species. The distribution of A. californica is mostly in the coastal region from northern California to southernmost British Columbia, while A. triphylla occurs predominantly in the Cascade mountain range.
10.2307/1219061|Esperanto is proposed, instead of Latin or English, for formal descriptions of extra-terrestrial taxa, if and when found.
10.2307/1219085| The monograph of the genus Oncidium, published by Krnzlin, in "Das Pflanzenreich IV. 50, Heft 80, 1922" has been found to be quite inaccurate and most unsatisfactory for identifications. Because accuracy is of paramount importance in taxonomy, and because this is the only available monograph of Oncidium, an attempt is made here to reappraise the whole work as well as to rearrange the species within the limits of the established sections. All existing type specimens have been studied and Krnzlin's illustrations reidentified with them. The nomenclature, whether pertaining to species or to supraspecific categories, is updated and brought in line with the requirements of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. For convenience, bibliographic references of omissions, as well as of species described since 1922, are added in the appropriate places. 
10.2307/1218947|The herbarium of Aylmer Bourke Lambert (1761-1842), British botanist, is of interest today because of its sale at auction after his death, and the consequent obscurity of its history. However, little known facts about its scope and fate can be found in manuscript material and published references. Lambert had many opportunities for acquiring the some 50,000 specimens, many of them types, from at least 130 collectors. The herbarium was freely consulted by many writers of the time, including Robert Brown, De Candolle, Martius, George Don and David Don. At the sale it was divided into 317 lots, bought by 16 buyers. There are today at least 18 institutions in Europe and the United States where specimens originally in the herbarium are now deposited.
10.2307/1218948|Beautiful coloured plates illustrate many of the new plant species described by Jacquin just about two centuries ago. For further detail than can be seen in the plates, it is necessary to find "Jacquin types," actual specimens used at the time by Jacquin. Today there is no single "Jacquin Herbarium" but his specimens are to be found at Vienna, in the Linnaean Herbarium, in the British Museum (N.H.), and some are dispersed in other European herbaria. Many botanists of that day exchanged materials very widely, and it is more likely that one can determine the type than the type locality for a Jacquin species. But in some cases it may be possible to show that Jacquin got his material through an official botanical expedition or through a specific individual. Good samples of N. K. Jacquin's handwriting are to be seen in the sheets of the Linnaean Herbarium which is available on microfiche. Many of the Jacquin sheets in the Natural History Museum in Vienna were relabelled by J. F. Jacquin, the son, in a characteristic left-hand corner script.
10.2307/1218949| The amino acid sequence of mung bean and sunflower cytochromes c have been determined on 3  moles of pure cytochrome by using a combination of high voltage paper electrophoresis and sequence analysis by the Dansyl/Edman method. These data have been compared with the wheat germ cytochrome c sequence. If the present potential of the method continues to be realised it is hoped to establish the major branches of a phylogenetic tree for the plant kingdom in the future. 
10.2307/1218950|The genus Cynodon was subdivided into C. arcuatus J. S. Presl ex C. B. Presl, C. aethiopicus Clayton et Harlan, C. barberi Rang. et Tad., C. dactylon (L.)

Schum.) Pilg., and C. transvaalensis Burrt-Davy. Cynodon arcuatus, C. aethiopicus, C. barberi, C. incompletus and C. plectostachyus are well isolated genetically from each other and the other species. The other taxa are closely allied genetically, but remain morphologically distinct in nature. Their classification is a functional one based almost exclusively on gross morphological discontinuities.

10.2307/1219279|Anomalous distribution of the Southern Hemisphere floras has long been recognized, and many explanations have been proposed. The occurrences of plants, modern or fossil, rarely point to a unique mode of distribution. A synthesis of pertinent information drawn from many disciplines (geonomy) is required to determine a most probable explanation. Recent studies of crustal mechanics by geophysicists show that sea-floor spreading can serve as an adequate mechanism for continental drift and can be important in explaining the distribution of ancient plants of the Southern Hemisphere. The Permian Glossopteris flora of southern continents contrasts strikingly with the Permian flora of the Northern Hemisphere. The identity of the northern flora that was contemporary with the Glossopteris flora was controversial for many years because of the great degree of isolation existing between the two floras. The botanical relationships of the glossopterids are still imperfectly established, particularly with reference to foliage occasionally found in northern areas or in deposits younger than Permian. Fertile structures of glossopterids seem to provide the only reliable basis for determining botanical relationship. The Glossopteris flora is, in general, extremely distinctive and consists taxonomically of a relatively small array of plants which occurs over an exceptionally large area. It represents an ecologic assemblage with both climatic and edaphic implications. A tentative Permian Gondwanaland reconstruction is presented that is somewhat more condensed than other reconstructions; the area thus reconstructed is more likely to have had a reasonably consistent, seasonal temperate climate in keeping with consistent similarities of the Glossopteris flora. According to this interpretation, most of the present area of the Indian Ocean seems to have been occupied by Permian Gondwanaland. The ridges and rises as recently mapped across the Indian Ocean floor are incompatible with foundered continents or isthmian links, but they can be interpreted as reflecting an historical sequence in sea-floor spreading that can account for the present dispersal of Gondwana continents.
10.2307/1219280|Geologically India is divisible into three units (1) Peninsular, (2) Extra-Peninsular and (3) Indo-Gangetic Plain. The Tertiary floras of India can conveniently be divided into two groups -- Palaeogene and Neogene. As known today, Palaeogene floras are found only in the Peninsular India, while Neogene occur in both the Peninsular and extra-Peninsular regions. They are predominantly tropical floras, made up of genera now largely confined to the Old World. A notable feature of the Indian Palaeogene is the occurrence of a few southern hemisphere taxa which may recall the pre-Cenozoic relationships between India and the Gondwana continents to the south. The London Clay flora shows noticeable general resemblance with the Indian Palaeogene. This feature is discussed taking into account the Tertiary plant fossils known from northern Africa. Phytogeographic comparison is also made with the Malaysian region. It is envisaged that there were large scale migrations and intermingling of floras over Malaysia, India, Arabia and Eastern Africa during Neogene time. Records of Dipterocarpaceae provide significant evidence. Water seems to have been a major factor in controlling the distribution of plants at low latitudes throughout the Cenozoic era. The palaeogeography of India during the Early Eocene and Miocene epochs has been reconstructed on the joint evidence of plant and animal fossils. Much work remains to be done before we shall have a clear understanding of the sources and migrations of the plants which have survived in southern Asia throughout Tertiary times to the present.
10.2307/1219281|Problems involved in the setting up of a systematic approach to the study of the geochemistry of landscapes for biogeochemical prospecting research in Canada have been described. Two aspects of the approach, 1) the establishment of a simple technique for the display of landscape geochemical data for purposes of comparison and 2) the setting up of a series of projects at different levels of detail needed to formalize the collection of information from landscapes for purposes of comparison, have been outlined and discussed by means of examples. Although the research described is at a relatively early stage of development it is believed that it is both feasible and practical to approach biogeochemical prospecting research along the lines described. It should be stressed that the aspects of the approach described here are essential preliminaries to detailed investigations involving comprehensive morphological, chemical and mathematical methods which together would provide basic information on the pattern and processes of the circulation of elements in landscapes including mineral deposits. Intensive investigations of this type are very costly in money, time and resources and would only be justified after very careful selection of sites along the lines described above.
10.2307/1219282|The development of botany in the tropics falls into four periods: (i) the age of the pioneer botanical explorers, which extended into the 19th century, (ii) the age from then to the First World War in which the plant resources of the tropics were developed mainly by colonial governments, (iii) the period between the two World Wars when improved hygiene and transport opened up new possibilities for scientific work in tropical countries and (iv) the present period which began at the end of the Second World War, in which even greater facilities for botanical research in the tropics have been accompanied by a continually accelerating destruction of the tropical biota. The present is therefore the best moment there will ever be for studying tropical botany.
10.2307/1219283|Tropical botanic gardens remain important for their records of local floras and as bases for continued monographic work. This work is still far from complete in the equatorial tropics, and it is the essential basis for all other study of plants, whether scientific or technological. The gardens also remain important as collections of living plants for botanical study of all kinds (especially for genetics and plant breeding) and for local education. A closer association of the gardens with universities is desirable, so that academic botanists may be fully aware of the range of local plants available for investigation. There is much still to be understood about the physiological adaptations of plants in the ever-wet tropics, a subject hardly dealt with in text-books of plant physiology published in temperate regions.
10.2307/1219284|Chromosome counts indicate that x = 9 in the aquatic genus Nymphoides (Menyanthaceae). New World species are tetraploid, but diploid species as well as tetraploid ones occur in the Old World. The pan-tropical N. indica is tetraploid in the New World and diploid in the Old World, but no consistent morphological characters have been found that separate these chromosomal races. The Eurasian N. peltata is hexaploid. Self-incompatible distyly, dioecism, and homostyly are present in the genus. The latter two breeding systems are believed to be derived from distyly. The Colombian N. flaccida seemingly occurs in the long-styled form only and because of its self-incompatibility may reproduce exclusively by vegetative means.
10.2307/1219285|Three taxa of the genus Abies occur in Eastern North America: A. balsamea (L.) Mill. var. balsamea, A. balsamea (L.) Mill. var. phanerolepis Fern., and A. fraseri (Pursh) Poir. The occurrence of "intermediate" populations in the Mid-Appalachians has resulted in a confused literature concerning the delimitation and distribution of these taxa. Data obtained from serological and electrophoretic investigation of seed protein are presented which support results of independent studies by Myers and Bormann (1963) and Robinson and Thor (1969). These data indicate that A. b. var. balsamea and A. fraseri are closely related and recently segregated taxa and that A. b. var. phanerolepis is more closely related to A. b. var. balsamea than to A. fraseri and is not of hybrid origin.
10.2307/1219286|Juniperus ashei Buch. was analyzed throughout its Texas distribution for areas of population differentiation and possible hybridization with J. virginiana L. and J. pinchotii Sudw. utilizing both morphological and chemical (terpenoid) characters. The volatile terpenoids of the foliage were analyzed by gas chromatography. Numerical methods included: analysis of variance; SNK tests; contour mapping of individual characters; differential systematics; and numerical taxonomy. Some peripheral populations of J. ashei show divergence of both terpenoid and morphological characters. This divergence is not, apparently, due to hybridization with J. virginiana or J. pinchotii. No evidence of hybridization was detected between J. ashei and J. virginiana or J. pinchotii. Differential systematics and numerical taxonomy were found to be of considerable value in the analysis of infraspecific variation.
10.2307/1219287|Rind and leaf oils of triploid Citrus hybrids from 5 crosses, and their diploid and tetraploid parents, were analysed by gas chromatography. Two-thirds of the chromosome complement of each hybrid was evidently contributed by the 4n parent. Overall, a wide range of percentages of the oil components occurred among hybrids and parents. There were differences significant at 1% in 80 of 90 parent-hybrid group comparisons. There was no regular, dominating effect of the 4n parents, and in many cases the influence of 4n and 2n parents seemed about equal. However, among hybrids involving 4n lemon there was often a tendency for leaf oil levels to follow those of that 4n parent. The general absence of such an effect in the rind oils, and in the leaf oils of the other crosses, parallels the implication of an earlier study in which autotetraploids of several Citrus species were usually similar to their parental diploids, in their percentages of rind oil components. Where 2 or 3 sets of hybrids had a common parent, either 2n or 4n, there was also no constant effect of that parent, from set to set, as compared to other parents involved. Variation in the percentages of any specific oil component was great among the 6 sister triploids in many crosses. Individuals sometimes approached the level of one parent, and sometimes that of the other. Transgression of one or more hybrids beyond either parent frequently occurred, and was particularly prominent with decanal, linalool, and linalyl acetate. Percentages of components in the leaf were often different from those in the rind. It is clear that these polyploid hybrids of rather closely related species show many inherited differences in oil components. These differences are principally quantitative and probably reflect genetic recombinations which have altered intermediate biochemical pathways.
10.2307/1219288|For a wider range of usefulness to buyers, merchants, breeders, and scientists, registers of cultivars should include the breeding history of each particular cultivar as far back as it can be traced. A cross reference of synonyms and translations of the cultivar names is also valuable. It is extremely laborious to find, select, interpret, record, and organize the pertinent information for such a register; compiling and updating the complete register is particularly tedious. This work can be greatly simplified through the use of an adequate computer system. This paper describes a system which has been developed for use with Oat cultivars (Avena) but which could be directly applicable in other areas as well. The system is completely automated throughout requiring only simple data input in the initial stages. Furthermore, the system is composed of several parts which can be used independently for specific purposes such as producing pedigree charts. A brief discussion concerning the benefits of such a register is also included.
10.2307/1219289|Eupatorium is redefined as a genus containing approximately 37 species and occurring in eastern North America, eastern Asia, along the western Asian mountains and in Europe.
10.2307/1219290|The species of Lycoperdon described by Bonorden are discussed and the authentic specimens of Lycoperdon cupricum, L. ericaeum, L. foetidum, L. fuscum, L. laxum and L. muricatum, already studied by Lloyd in G, are designated as neotypes. Most of Bonorden's names are synonyms of Persoonian ones, only L. ericaeum and L. foetidum should be used. It is established for the first time that L. ericaeum is the correct name of the species usually known as L. muscorum Morg.
10.2307/1219291|In recent years the genus Ascophanus Boud. has been segregated into a number of genera. One of these, Coprotus Korf and Kimbr., is typified by Ascobolus sexdecimsporus Cr. & Cr. (= Ascophanus sexdecimsporus (Cr. & Cr.) Boud., Ryparobius sexdecimsporus (Cr. & Cr.) Sacc., Coprotus sexdecimsporus (Cr. & Cr.) Kimbr. and Korf). Eckblad noted that the type specimen of Leporina multispora Vel., the basis of the monotypic genus Leporina Vel., was found to bear apothecia identical with those of A. sexdecimsporus. He implied that Leporina was the correct name for Coprotus. This paper attempts to clarify the nomenclatural problem, and concludes that Leporina cannot be successfully typified. The unambiguous generic taxon Coprotus may be retained.
10.2307/1219292|In current classifications of the Suboperculate Discomycetes, a single family, Sarcoscyphaceae, is almost universally recognized, with two tribes, Sarcoscypheae and Urnuleae. An older family name is available, and the correct name for the family as currently delimited must be Sarcosomataceae, and of the tribes, Sarcoscypheae and Sarcosomateae respectively. A new classification is proposed here, in which two families are delimited, each divided into two tribes: Sarcosomataceae (= Urnuleae sensu Le Gal), with tribes Sarcosomateae and Galielleae, and Sarcoscyphaceae emend. (= Sarcoscypheae sensu Le Gal) with tribes Sarcoscypheae and Boedijnopezizeae. Twenty-five genera are assigned positions under the families and tribes recognized in the new classification. The family name Sarcoscyphaceae, even with its emended circumscription, is technically a superfluous name, but arguments are advanced for retaining the name in its new concept and for non-application of Article 63 of the Code of Nomenclature.
10.2307/1219294|Conflicting interpretations of Allium descendens L. made it necessary to determine the original usage of this epithet in Linnaeus's "Species Plantarum" (1753). The single sheet (419.15) of this species in the Linnaean Herbarium, named by Linnaeus, is from SE. Russia, whereas Linnaeus quoted Helvetia as its area of distribution. Thus, the Linnaean specimen cannot be considered as the type. No illustration cited in "Species Plantarum" is adequate to serve as lectotype of the species. It is also possible that the species was based on a cultivated plant of unknown origin. As the name A. descendens L. was applied in later literature to several species, it is recommended that it be rejected as a nomen ambiguum.
10.2307/1219295|The name Tristachya Lilpop 1937 for an Upper Paleozoic plant similar to Sphenophyllum is a younger homonym to Tristachya Nees von Esenbeck 1829, a living genus belonging to the Gramineae. The new name Lilpopia is proposed instead of the illegitimate name.
10.2307/1219296|Sparganium simplex Hudson (1778) is a superflous name; the correct name for the simple-stemmed Bur-reed is Sparganium emersum Rehmann (1871).
10.2307/1219297|The name Euphorbia verrucosa L. is validly published since the publication in 1759 is to be regarded as a mere emendation of the description published in 1753. The original E. verrucosa L. comprised two different species, E. verrucosa L. 1753 emend. 1759 and E. stricta L. 1759. E. stricta L. is also a legitimate name; the species is different from E. verrucosa, being completely glabrous.

10.2307/1218297|Four opportunities in botanical history obtain: pressing the search for records, saving historically valuable materials before they are lost, compiling informational retrieval aids, and writing interpretive biographies and social histories. Details of these opportunities are discussed with comments on the state of our knowledge and the location of materials.
10.2307/1218298|Herbarium sets distributed by William A. Schipp to European and American institutions represent one of the most significant and extensive collections ever made of the coastal plain flora for the Stann Creek and Toledo Districts of southern British Honduras. Schipp (1933-34) compiled the first complete flora of these districts in the form of a Catalogue entitled, "Flora of British Honduras, Pricelist of Seeds & Herbarium Material". As a professional Botanical Explorer, Schipp's discrimination in the field yielded a total of 154 taxa new to science, including two new genera, Schippia Burret and Schizocardia Smith & Standley (= Purdiaea Planchon). Itineraries for collections made by Schipp from 1929 through 1935 are based on 1462 herbarium specimens found in the Forestry Department Herbarium, Paslow Building, Belize City, British Honduras. Schipp's specimens in the Forestry Department Herbarium include 115 isotypes which have been verified, restored, and placed in a type collection. Maps are presented to aid in the location of previously vague type localities.
10.2307/1218299|In this paper we suggest how quantitative attributes may most usefully and informatively be used in describing taxa, and point out certain inadequacies in the conventional ways in which quantitative attributes are used in taxonomic descriptions.
10.2307/1218300|Taxonomists generally recognize the value of collection dates in planning biosystematic research but do not always appreciate their usefulness in documenting migrations and introductions. A survey of several journals shows that many taxonomists fail to include collection dates in monographs and other taxonomic treatises. Correlation of collection dates for a particular taxon with dates of general botanical collecting in a particular locality has been used to document an eastward migration of Dyssodia tenuiloba (DC) Rob. in Texas and the introduction of Thelypteris dentata (Forssk.) E. St. John into the New World.
10.2307/1218301|In 1949 betalains were reported to possibly co-occur with an anthocyanidin (cyanidin) in Carpobrotus edulis; however, upon re-examination of this plant, only betalains and leucoanthocyanidins were detected. Thus, to date, all evidence indicates that the two classes of plant pigments, betalains and anthocyanins, are mutually exclusive. The detection of betalains in seven species belonging to the family Amaranthaceae and ten species of the Chenopodiaceae are also reported.
10.2307/1218302|Pollen grains of taxa representing the four described pollen types of Fagus and Nothofagus were observed with the scanning electron microscope to determine preparation effects. Pollen grains were observed before treatment with KOH, after treatment with KOH, and after acetolysis had been completed. The photomicrographs illustrate that the effect of various preparation techniques differ from species to species. Therefore, it is important in any systematic pollen research to ascertain the amount of change in the material so that the data can be placed in proper perspective for comparative interpretation.
10.2307/1218303|Studies of the vegetative morphology and anatomy of the genera Flagellaria and Joinvillea indicate that there are striking and highly significant differences between them, of such a nature that the current concept of the family Flagellariaceae seems artificial. Therefore Joinvillea is segregated into a newly proposed family, Joinvilleaceae.
10.2307/1218304|Androsace vitaliana (L.) Lap. (Primula vitaliana L.) has been typified differently by recent authors. The proposal to typify the name by Sesler's plate is rejected; instead the typification on the basis of the relevant specimen in the Burser herbarium is reiterated.
10.2307/1218305| According to Art. 53 of the ICBN the name Stipa pennata L. which is given as an example to the rule in the Code, must be used for S. joannis elak.; it was Mansfeld (1939) who reintroduced this name. Some recent authors abandon Mansfeld's lectotypification and propose to eliminate the example of S. pennata L. from Art. 53. The present author shows that there is no reason to do so because the alteration of the diagnosis given by Steven (1857) cannot be considered an emendation and Mansfeld's lectotypification was not based upon a misinterpretation of the original description. 
10.2307/1218306| The name Aconitum divergens Pani (1883) (see Seitz 1969) is a younger homonym for Aconitum divergens Rafinesque (1836) which is synonymous with A. uncinatum L. -- a species from North America. Therefore, A. divergens Pan. must be rejected according to article 64 of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN 1961). The legitimate name of A. divergens Pan. is "Aconitum pentheri Hayek (1917)" including the type subspecies "ssp. pentheri" and the new combination "ssp. burnatii (Gayer) Seitz comb. nov.". 
10.2307/1218307|Two species of Bonamia which have been confused with the genus Maripa are discussed. Typification for Bonamia trichantha is clarified and a new synonym given. The lectotype is chosen for B. maripoides with a plate of type labels showing handwriting samples of Choisy, Hallier, and Martius. Ecological data and exsiccatae derived from herbarium material and field studies in Brazil are provided.

The growth, significance, and ultimate fate of Delessert's herbarium and library are discussed against the background of the French cultural and scientific scene of the first sixty years of the nineteenth century. 
10.2307/1218529|In animals, adaptive radiation at the level of species is based to a large extent upon adaptations to survival in different climates, as well as to the occupation of different ecological niches in similar communities. In plants, adaptive radiation at the species level, as well as the origin of higher categories, depends to a large extent upon diversification of the methods of reproduction, both pollination and seed dispersal, as well as seed germination and the establishment of seedlings. With respect to the latter, evolutionary success depends to a large extent upon solution of three often conflicting problems: protection of the developing seed, dispersal to a new but similar location; and germination with sufficient seedling vigor to survive competition. In plants, the origin of higher categories is not associated with the appearance of distinctive characters that never serve to distinguish species. Evolutionary progress, here regarded as an increase in the amount and diversity of DNA-coded information, is based upon the bias in favor of mutations that increase rather than reduce the amount of genetic information already present.
10.2307/1218530|Born over 200 years ago the science of anthecology (pollination ecology) has developed new concepts in the last 50 years using quantified information from studies of insect sense perception and behavior. Flower-insect coadaptation is considered a continuing process in which changing interrelationships establish and remove reproductive barriers in breeding systems at the vital link of pollen transport. Convergent evolution is apparently reflected in the development of similar pollination mechanisms in unrelated plant taxa through pollinator sharing, floral mimicry, and synchronous anthesis of sympatric species. Reproductive isolation of plant taxa is suggested in diversity and versatility of pollinator behavior, unsynchronized anthesis, and functional as well as structural differences in pollination mechanisms. Contributions of anthecology to systematics are primarily useful for a fuller understanding of the origin of taxonomic entities and secondarily in defining criteria for their establishment.
10.2307/1218531|Polyploidy played a significant role in the origin and evolution of many plant species. The primary phylogenetic effect of polyploidy is to stabilize selected hybrid genotypes. It also provides a mechanism by which daughter and parental populations become immediately isolated from each other. Isolation, however, is rarely complete, and introgression commonly takes place across partially sterile hybrids. Polyploidy also buffers genotypes against the shock of absorbing foreign genomes, making hybridization possible between species that are otherwise genetically isolated from each other. Traditional taxonomy can usually not adequately indicate the extent of variability that characterize polyploid complexes.
10.2307/1218532|Phenotypic variation is as poorly understood as it is ubiquitous. Many biologists hold simplistic and even contradictory views of the relation between genic diversity and phenotypic variation. The correlation of electrophoretically detectable enzyme polymorphisms and morphological variation in island populations of lizards is described. A model explaining the different levels of genetic-phenetic variation among the populations is suggested by a multiple regression analysis. The principal conclusions are that gene flow between habitats significantly elevates variation, and isolation by distance results in a variation asymptote.

Populations of D. pseudoobscura from ecological margins are as heterozygous as those in the center and the allele frequencies are very similar in all the populations except in Bogota, Colombia, which is a complete isolate from the main body of the species. The Bogota population of D. pseudoobscura has reduced genetic variation and when Bogota females are mated to males of various populations from the United States and Guatemala, the F
10.2307/1218535|Certain structural changes have occurred repeatedly in the evolution of flowering plants. Evidence for these evolutionary trends is often in the form of character gradients or morphoclines, within which the direction of change can be inferred from paleobotanical, geographical, or ecological circumstances. No trends are more firmly established than those involving microscopic characters of the secondary xylem, trends for which the ancestral condition is known from fossil evidence. Recently, trends in the evolution of angiospermous pollen grains have also been convincingly demonstrated from the fossil record. Since postulated evolutionary trends in floral structure cannot be verified in the same manner, floral anatomy has always been a controversial subject. Despite the controversy, the anatomical investigation of flowers benefits systematics in at least two ways: by revealing characters of potential taxonomic value and, when floral vascular bundles of related taxa are united in varying degree, by indicating the direction of evolutionary change.
10.2307/1218536|The study of functional anatomy, biological roles of features, and adaptations is not a practical starting point for establishing a classification but the concepts derived from such studies may be powerful tools in solving difficult taxonomic problems. They also serve to modify or corroborate classifications and to make them biologically meaningful. The functional approach may be used at any taxonomic level. The biological species definition provides an important base line for comparison with other categories. Functional anatomy may play a role in ranking taxa into a hierarchy through its contribution to recognition of key adaptations, adaptive radiation, parallel evolution, convergent evolution, determining the direction of evolution, and determining the most closely related group. Ultimately we may understand the hierarchy of adaptations that forms the basis for natural groupings of organisms.
10.2307/1218537|A brief outline is given of the principal types of multivariate statistical techniques which have found use in taxonomy. Techniques such as correlation, principal components, canonical correlation, and factor analyses are described for problems dealing with analysis of covariation within a single sample. Techniques such as canonical variate, cluster, multidimensional scaling, and network analyses are described for dealing with analyses of among sample variation. The purpose of this account is to give an intuitive understanding of what the various techniques have to offer to research in taxonomy.
10.2307/1218538|Sympatric congeneric species of flowering plants are precluded from freely exchanging genes by reproductive barriers which are operative prior to pollination, between pollination and fertilization and after fertilization. The barriers may be the by-products of divergent evolution, or may have been selected for their ability to reduce hybridization and disruptive gene flow, or competition for similar elements of the pollinator fauna. Autogamy and hybrid floral isolation are included in a classification of reproductive isolating barriers. The origin of reproductive barriers is discussed in light of new information and insight on pollinator behavior and perception, the S-gene complex, pollen-tube competition, and population level selection. It is suggested that reproductive barriers are not inherent properties of species, but reside in the interface between species, and arise from the incongruities in the reproductive formats of species paired in nature or by the systematist.
10.2307/1218539|The breeding biology and host plant specificity of the Hawaiian Drosophila (Drosophilidae) are examined for evidence of sympatric speciation by comparing these attributes with those of the fugivorous flies Rhagoletis (Tephritidae). Since mate and host selection are directly correlated in Rhagoletis and since they are univoltine, this form of speciation is a real possibility. However, most of the Drosophila in Hawaii breed all year under proper conditions and the majority of closely related species utilize the same or very similar substrates for larval development thus species packing is high. Substrate specificity appears for the most part to be more important in the categories above the species level. On the other hand, even though mate and host selection are not correlated, the phenomenon of lek behavior in many species of Hawaiian Drosophila would be expected to force inbreeding and local isolation. Exactly how local the isolation is, remains for future investigation.
10.2307/1218540|It is suggested that the most meaningful problem for most systematists working at the graduate or doctoral level is that of monographic-type studies of relatively small genera, subgenera or sections (i.e., ca 20-40 species) in which the taxa are studied as populations in the field and with phyletic considerations as a conceptual basis for arrangements. A considerable degree of specialization is acknowledged as being desireable in one or more of the following areas: (1) classical systematics; (2) cytogenetical systematics; (3) chemical systematics and (4) numerical systematics. However, most workers will need a broad exposure to area (1) since this is fundamental to the other three; indeed, it is argued that classical monographic studies of poorly studied taxa in remote regions using populational data should be given priority-focus over the next 30 years. Relatively few systematists should become highly discipline-oriented with respect to approach (i.e., cytogenetic, chemical or numerical) since most workers will be employed as teacher-researchers at smaller institutions where time and equipment are minimal resources. As regards recognition of potentially successful doctoral candidates it is concluded that if a student's work gives him pleasure he will be successful, no matter what his training for the seventies.
10.2307/1218541|Current neglect of large groups and upper levels of the taxonomic hierarchy is undesirable. Computational approaches draw attention to the disorganised state of the descriptive literature, and it is suggested that in addition to the needs for teamwork and a more cosmopolitan outlook, there is a need for action to increase the availability and accessibility of comparative data suitable for large-scale monographs and world surveys.
10.2307/1218542| The present paper suggests that, despite its conceptual weakness, the cladistic approach to the delimitation of genera contains a valuable logical formalism. This logic could be applied to the dendrogram of the informational (genetic) similarity between the taxa to be classified. Even if this leads to a departure from a purely phyletic model of classification -- that cannot be always maintained in a classification because of the internal limitations of the concept of classification -- this approach corresponds much better to what we want a classification to be. A logical justification is given to phenetic taxonomy, when properly done. /// [French] Malgr la faiblesse de son concept de base, le cladisme contient dans sa logique interne des lments trs valables.

10.2307/1218543|A review of the development of the International Union of Biological Sciences (IUBS) since its establishment in 1919, preceded by some remarks on the origin of 'biology' as a discipline and on nineteenth century international cooperation in the natural sciences. After a rather slow start in the years before the second World War in which the activities were mainly centered upon the section of botany, IUBS developed fully after 1945 into a truly representative international forum for biology. The most pressing problems facing biology and IUBS in the early seventies -- documentation and the environment -- are briefly discussed with special reference to the change of attitude apparent in biology, as well as in biologists from 'pure' and 'detached' to a social and cultural 'engagement'.
10.2307/1218877|A considerable number of instances are discussed where parallel developments outside family relationships occur, restricted in geographical distribution: 1) divaricate shrubs in New Zealand, with 51 species in 23 families, 2) the Eucalypt leaf type in Australia, occurring in 12 families, 3) terete and holly-type leaves in Western Australia, 4) red autumn leaf coloration in Northeastern America and Japan, 5) leaf convergence in Mediterranean climates, 6) the cushion plants in Southern Patagonia, 7) parallels in anatomical structure in the Southwestern United States, 8) red tubular hummingbird flowers of the Southwestern United States. This is contrasted with cases of convergent characters on the genus or family level, or geographically unrelated parallel development. In the discussion it is argued that such parallel development might well represent rare-nonsexual transfer of chromosomal segments. It is obviously one of the major evolutionary mechanisms in the development of the multitude of dicotyledonous species.
10.2307/1218878|The use of vegetation in interpreting geological phenomena is becoming an important tool in the search for ore deposits that are buried under thick soil cover or layers of unmineralized rock. Species assemblages and plant density are useful in mapping geologic strata of different chemical composition and reservoir capacity. Hidden ore deposits can be located through chemical analysis of plant tissue, by mapping the distribution of species, and by observing toxic effects caused by an excess of metals as well as signs of faulty nutrition or deranged metabolism in plants whose roots are in contact with ore. Plant indicators of ore deposits may be species that are adapted to living exclusively on rocks or soils that supply unusual amounts of a particular element, or they may be species of wide distribution that favor mineralized ground under certain local conditions because of a change in acidity or availability of major plant constituents. Plants that are not highly tolerant of metals in an ore assemblage may exhibit toxicity symptoms or be completely absent over ore. Geobotanical techniques of mapping indicator plant species and communities, combined with observation of changes in plant appearance can aid the geologist in prospecting for hidden ore deposits.
10.2307/1218879|In this paper I argue in favor of the use of the "biological" species concept rather than either a "typological" concept or a "morphological" concept. In simple form my argument is as follows: Biologists are not merely interested in storing data but in finding satisfactory explanations for that data. Taxonomy is an integral part of this theoretical enterprise. The most satisfactory theory at present for understanding (providing explanations for) biological phenomena is the synthetic theory of evolution. Development of this theory requires use of the biological species concept rather than the other species concepts. The basic limitation on the use of this concept is noted and some objections to the use of the concept are considered.
10.2307/1218880|Current methods of specimen identification are surveyed, and algorithms are given for constructing dichotomous keys and for identifying specimens directly with a polythetic polyclave procedure. Although usable without computers, these techniques have been automated as Fortran programs on a time-sharing system. Taxon/character data are encoded as a hierarchy of data matrices for use with the various programs. Largescale taxonomic information systems are also briefly discussed.
10.2307/1218881|A new course covering major aspects of the use of computers in systematics was recently offered at Michigan State University. The course consisted of lectures delivered by 12 speakers, discussion sessions, and reports on student projects. Topics included computers and systematics, the Flora North America Program, specimen identification and key-construction by computer, parallels between specimen identification and medical diagnosis, plant disease diagnosis by computer, information problems in paleontology, distribution mapping by computer, biometrics and statistical studies with computers, probabilistic approaches to specimen identification, computers as aids to teaching systematic biology, numerical taxonomy, the modeling of genetic and evolutionary systems, possible computerized nomenclatural aids, and biogeographical analysis with computers.
10.2307/1218882|Known chromosome numbers in the Loranthaceae are reviewed and 102 new records added. The basic number of the family is x = 12 and there has been progressive aneuploid reduction to x = 8. The early development of the family has been under temperate conditions in the Southern Hemisphere, where stocks with x = 12 and 11 became established in temperate South America and Australasia. Rapid aneuploid reduction continued after the establishment of strong continental isolation, establishing numbers of x = 9 and 8 in the Old and New Worlds respectively. Massive secondary radiation in the tropics has followed, involving the 12-, 9- and 8-paired stocks. Increase in chromosome size occurred during the tropical radiation, perhaps compensating for loss of recombination potential due to aneuploid reduction. Polyploidy is a rare and recent phenomenon in the history of the family, being documented in only two Central American taxa. One of these may be an autoploid.
10.2307/1218883| Known chromosome numbers in the Viscaceae and Eremolepidaceae are reviewed and 73 new records added. No basic number is presently evident for either family as a whole. In the Vicaceae two fundamental chromosome groups are apparent. The first is characterized by x = 14 and is itself composed of two subgroups, one with large chromosomes (Dendrophthora-Phoradendron), and the other with medium sized chromosomes (Arceuthobium-Korthalsella). The second chromosome group is composed of Viscum and its close relatives which possess numbers of x = 10, 11, 12, and 13 and which have large chromosomes. In the x = 14 group, the Dendrophthora-Phoradendron alliance is strictly New World. The Arceuthobium-Korthalsella alliance, however, has both Old and New World representation. Arceuthobium is present in both the Old and New Worlds and Korthalsella has an Old World and Pacific distribution. The Viscum alliance is strictly Old World. Some infra-generic aneuploidy is known in Viscum and Dendrophthora. Polyploidy is apparently rare, known only in Phoradendron from the Galpagos Islands and in Viscum from New Guinea and northern Australia. A northern origin is postulated for the Viscaceae, with subsequent widespread radiation into the tropics of both the New and Old Worlds. The Eremolepidaceae, a group of three New World genera, does not appear to be karyologically related to other mistletoe families; it is postulated they may be aerial parasites in the Santalaceae, which is primarily a family of terrestrial root parasites. 
10.2307/1218884|One of the most pressing problems facing a worker in any scientific discipline is that of having a guide to the huge and ever-expanding literature in his field. This is especially important for the systematic botanist who not only must keep abreast of the literature and names of the present, but must also have a reference to those of the past -- at least as far back as 1753. Fortunately there exist a number of indices which provide a guide to names of plants in groups of greater or lesser extent. To botanists dealing with vascular plants, there are available the Index Kewensis, the Gray Herbarium Card Index, the Index Nominum Genericorum, the Index Filicum, and others dealing with fern-allies.
10.2307/1218885|Of 762 new species described by Ducke ten belong to the genera Thiloa, Ramatuella and Buchenavia (Combretaceae). They were described in two series of articles, containing respectively ten and six papers. Type specimens should be located in MG and RB respectively, but only one of the six species described in the first series is in fact represented in MG by a type specimen. Type specimens of all four species described in the second series of papers are, on the other hand, present at RB. Details of the locations of all type specimens are provided, and possible reasons for the non-existence of types at MG discussed.
10.2307/1218886| Charles Gaudichaud-Beaupr described the genus Charpentiera in the form of two species, C. ovata and C. obovata, but did not indicate which of the species should serve as type. Horace Mann was the first to indicate the lectotype of the genus when he reduced C. obovata to synonymy. The reference to the lectotype in the Index Nominum Genericorum should therefore be Mann, Proc. Amer. Acad. Arts 7: 200. 1866, rather than Schinz (in Engler et Prantl, Nat. Pflanzenfamilien 3 (1.a): 101 Aug. 1893) as it is at present. 
10.2307/1218244|A review of the development of Lamarck's ideas on biological systematics with special reference to the origin and development of his concept of organic evolution. Lamarck's development towards biological systematics is traced through his early botanical and geological writings and related to the gradual change in his scientific outlook from a static and essentialist view of nature towards a dynamic and positivist concept of the life sciences as a special discipline. This development is seen against the background of the general cultural developments during the course of his life.
10.2307/1218245|One of the major facets in the development of botany in America during the latter part of the eighteenth and the early portion of the nineteenth century was the preparation of private pressed plant collections or herbaria. When these herbaria were no longer needed by their owners, they were either given or bequeathed to a public institution, sold privately, or auctioned publicly. The first known public auction of a private herbarium in America occurred in Philadelphia on the 3rd of June 1833. Owned by the late Zaccheus Collins, well-known Quaker philanthropist and botanist, this herbarium included (1) plants Collins collected in New Jersey and Pennsylvania and plants from various parts of the United States obtained by exchange with his friends, (2) an extensive collection of exotic plants, and (3) the entire herbarium of the late William Baldwin. At the auction the first two parts were acquired by the executor of the estate, and the latter was purchased by Daniel Steinhauer for the Rev. Lewis David von Schweinitz. In amalgamating the Baldwin plants with his own, Schweinitz replaced the original data with a cryptic notation for each specimen, thereby creating problems for future botanists. Schweinitz's herbarium was bequeathed to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. That portion of Collins' herbarium belonging to the executor was later acquired by C. S. Rafinesque as a partial settlement of a claim Rafinesque had against the Collins estate. After Rafinesque's death, Elias Durand purchased the Rafinesque herbarium. Durand selected out Collins' plants and discarded most of Rafinesque's own plants. Collins' plants evidently formed a large part of Durand's herbarium which he gave to the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris, where it remains today as a separate collection. A summary of the numbers of taxa described from specimens in Baldwin's and Collin's herbaria as determined from major selected publications are eight described by Baldwin himself, 109 described from Baldwin's specimens by other botanists, and 103 described from specimens in Collins' herbarium by Rafinesque.
10.2307/1218246|Like many other 18th century natural history works produced primarily for their coloured copper-plate illustrations, this was published in instalments a few plates at a time, and the relevant text was not issued simultaneously. In consequence publication should not be quoted as consisting of three volumes, but as 188 (nominally, 190) plates published between 1750 and 1792 with text published in 1756, 1768 (? late 1767), 1772 and 1786. The dates of engraving the plates are given, where available.
10.2307/1218247|Using paper chromatography, phenolic pigment profiles were established for each of 160 plants representing three species and various intermediate ("hybrid") forms of Tiarella (Saxifragaceae). The 160 plants included two collections of 80 plants each, one collection made on July 13, the other on August 10 (1969). All plants were collected during anthesis from a sympatric population. The similarities of pigment profiles were determined by computer programming and were used as measurements of interspecific, intraspecific, and intraindividual variation, the latter represented by phenolic changes which occurred between collection dates. Consideration has been given to various phenomenona which might have induced intra-individual variation and its genetic regulation and application to systematics have been emphasized.
10.2307/1218248|Morphological, taxonomic, and field observations on the ecology of the monotypic narrowly endemic genus Geocarpon in southeastern Arkansas are presented, and the presence of anthocyanin pigments is demonstrated in plants of Geocarpon minimum, providing further support for its placement in the Caryophyllaceae rather than in the Aizoaceae to which it was originally assigned.
10.2307/1218249|First reports of chromosome numbers in the following families of Annoniflorae, sub-order Laurineae, are presented: Gomortegaceae (Gomortega nitida, 2n = 24), Gyrocarpaceae (Gyrocarpus americanus, n = 15), and Lactoridaceae (Lactoris fernandeziana, 2n = c. 40). For Monimiaceae, the most important basic number for subfamily Monimioideae is x = 19, while other numbers must be confirmed. The recently segregated Siparunaceae and Atherospermataceae have x = 22. Further chromosomal work in Monimiaceae s. lat. is strongly urged.
10.2307/1218250|A detailed chromosome study has been made of 58 species in 30 genera of the tropical family Meliaceae. The results largely confirm observations, by other investigators on similar tropical woody groups, that high chromosome numbers are common and that polyploidy is a frequent phenomenon. Although the chromosomes are, in most species, very small and metacentric, some differences in chromosome size and shape are detectable. Many genera seem to have a high base number and/or several different numbers. The Meliaceae, unlike some other tropical woody groups, are particularly interesting because of the considerable range of chromosome numbers they exhibit. Differences in number have been observed between even closely related species in the economically important timber genera Swietenia, Cedrela and Toona, and this has an obvious bearing on future tree breeding and tree improvement studies. The taxonomic significance of chromosome numbers is discussed.
10.2307/1218251|The taxonomic value of plant hairs would be enhanced by a standardized terminology. However, the great diversity in hair morphology often precludes using single terms to describe hair types. In some genera the multitude of hair features requires numerous descriptive terms just as do other complex plant parts. It is suggested that efforts be made by systematists using hair characters in descriptions to be precise in terminology and to derive terms from Latin rather than generalize hair types as simple, stellate, etc. The genus Solanum exhibits great hair diversity. Some examples of hairs from this genus are illustrated and a terminology suggested.
10.2307/1218252|The methods of formal taxonomy have not been very satisfactory for the classification of cultivated plants. As a result, the people who deal with cultivated plants the most have developed their own informal and intuitive classifications based on experience as to what constitutes useful groupings. An attempt is made to provide a framework in which both systems can operate with a minimum of confusion. The structure of the total available gene pool is characterized by assigning taxa to primary, secondary and tertiary gene pools. At the infraspecific level, cultivars are grouped into races and subraces in an informal way without rigid rules for the use of terms.
10.2307/1218253|A standard method of comparing classifications is the "cophenetic correlation" technique of Sokal and Rohlf (1962). The method is re-examined, and is shown to possess two shortcomings which make it unsuitable for the truncated, intensely-clustering strategies now in common use. These shortcomings are (i) it is unable to distinguish between changes due to group composition and changes due to configuration of groups within the hierarchy, and (ii) it is sensitive to the convention used for representing the hierarchy in two dimensions. A revised form of the strategy is proposed which appears to overcome these difficulties.
10.2307/1218254|A formal description is given of a new class of algae, separated from the Xanthophyceae by several unique features of zoospore organisation, particularly the large size and special construction of the eyespot and the location of the flagellar swelling, and the form of the pyrenoid in the vegetative cell.
10.2307/1218255|The most important fact about a name is its meaning. Most family names of ferns have had such different meanings, as used by different authors, that such names are only intelligible if we associate them with the names of particular authors. What is needed is more observation of comparative morphology and more insight into its significance; only in this way shall we be able to arrive at a generally acceptable set of families. In the meantime it would best serve the ultimate stability of nomenclature if we regard all family names of ferns as informal and tentative (which in fact they have always been). At present, the only effective definition of a family is that it comprises a certain genus, as typified by a certain species, and any other genera which a particular author may believe to be related to the type genus.
10.2307/1218256| The generic name Christella Lveill is typified by the species Polypodium parasiticum Linn. Thus typified the name can be used for a natural group of species which the author believes should have generic rank and of which he proposes to publish a monograph at a later date. 
10.2307/1218257|Rheede described 3 species in his Hortus malabaricus which were later to be placed in the genus Strychnos. Two of these were included by Linnaeus in his 'Species Plantarum', namely S. nux-vomica and S. colubrina. The subsequent confusion between Rheede's "Modira-caniram" which is included in Linnaeus's "S. colubrina" and Rheede's "Scheru-katu-valli-caniram" is discussed. It is shown that the present understanding of Linnaeus's "S. colubrina" is incorrect and this name is rejected in accordance with Article 69 of the International Code. The authors consider Linnaeus's "S. colubrina" to be conspecific with the later described S. wallichiana Steud. ex DC. which name is the first unequivocal one for use. The first valid name for the entity currently referred to as S. colubrina and which includes Rheede's "Scheru-katu-valli-caniram" is S. minor Dennst.
10.2307/1218258| The mapping scheme for the Flora of Central Europe forms the basis for the preparation of a distributional atlas. This atlas should contain the maps of all Central European vascular plants (Pteridophyta and Spermatophyta) based on grid units of 10 long.  6 lat. The maps will cover Austria, western and central Czechoslovakia, Germany (G.D.R. and G.F.R.), Switzerland, northern Italy and northwestern Yugoslavia (north of 45 N and west of 19 10 E), together with some neighbouring territories. Work on the mapping scheme was started a few years ago in most Central European countries with the help of numerous voluntary collaborators, many local working groups, and several regional centers. The current activity is characterized by international cooperation and the accumulation of data prepared for modern machine handling. A "Check list of the vascular plants of Central Europe" (Ehrendorfer & al., cf. fig. 1) and a grid system based on geographical longitudes and latidudes supply the numerically coded taxonomical and geographical reference units. The system of data handling is demonstrated in fig. 2: Records from field work as well as herbarium and literature sources are first incorporated into printed field lists (fig. 3), punch cards with text (fig. 4) or data forms (fig. 5). Records are then transferred to punched cards or magnetic tape, partly through mark-sensing coding-forms and mark-sensing reader. Finally, lists of records as well as distributional maps will be available by automatic printing from tabulators and/or data plotters. 10 sample maps demonstrate the design and information value of the distributional maps for the atlas; at the same time they illustrate the considerable deficiencies in our present knowledge of actual distribution in higher plants. Everybody interested in Central European floristics and geobotany is therefore invited to participate in regional or national organizations of the mapping scheme in order to realize the project of a distributional atlas of the Central European flora. 
10.2307/1218259| The use of the binary nomenclature in botany, attributed to Linn, is deeply rooted as far back as in antiquity. Its beginning, principles and way of forming can be followed in the work of Theophrastos, enlarged later by Dioscorides and especially in the encyclopedian work of Plinius, in which the binary nomenclature is about 62%, certainly without genus or species concept. In the works of the above-mentioned authors, one can recognize rudiments of the hierarchical arrangement of plant groups, antithetical keys in identifications, priority, indication of author names, antagonistic tendencies of splitting or lumping, separation of synonyms from the standardized names, as well as recognition of inadequate names. 
10.2307/1218260|The type localities given in Bonpland's "Monographia Melastomacearum" are sometimes erroneous, the true collection data often being ascertainable by consultation of the holotypes in Paris, by comparison with isotypes, or from modern data on species distribution. Study of Bonpland's field books and comparison of specimens with published illustrations will often confirm the actual collection information.
10.2307/1218261|A. R. Ferreira made extensive collections in the Amazon valley and northern Planalto of Brazil during 1783-1792. The Paris duplicates of these collections have been studied by many monographers, but are usually not attributed to Ferreira. The Ferreira Melastomataceae have generally been cited as collected by Bonpland, resulting in misleading phytogeography. The melastome types now known from this early expedition are listed, with some notes on the species synonymy.
10.2307/1218263|The joint Unesco-ICSU feasibility study for the establishment of a World Science Information System (Unisist) has been completed. The conclusion and recommendations of the study have been published. An intergovernmental conference will be convened in October 1971 with the aim of establishing and putting the system into operation.
10.2307/1218596|Milestones in genecology
10.2307/1218597|Fine structure studies on 46 species from 26 families of Magnoliidae and Ranunculidae enabled a classification of their sieve-tube plastids into P-type or S-type. In accordance with many other dicotyledons, most of the species (31) develop S-type plastids that accumulate starch. 15 species (all from Magnoliidae) contain P-type plastids that have protein inclusions (exclusively, or besides starch grains). Among the latter are all investigated species from Annonaceae-Canellaceae-Myristicaceae-Aristolochiaceae. Since earlier phytochemical studies revealed affinities between these families, the formation of P-type plastids confirms the connection between these families and the position of the Aristolochiaceae in the Magnoliidae.
10.2307/1218598|Sieve tubes of Caryophyllales (35 species from 12 families investigated) contain specific plastids that are characterized by peripherally lying ring-shaped bundles of proteinaceous filaments and often an additional core. In most of the families the presence of a peculiar plastid in sieve tubes coincides with the formation of betacyanins and betaxanthins, typically restricted to Caryophyllales, but there are some exceptions: Molluginaceae and Caryophyllaceae have the specific plastids but lack the special plant-pigments; Batis, often put next to the Chenopodiaceae, has neither of them. The taxonomic value of both sieve-tube plastids and plant pigments with special reference to Bataceae is discussed. Finally, these data are used to suggest a restructuring of the subclass Caryophyllidae.
10.2307/1218599|The pollen of all species of Clarkia (Onagraceae) has been investigated by light and scanning electron microscopy. Fifteen characters were scored and analysed by numerical taxonomic methods. The resulting dendrogram successfully separates several of the natural groups within Clarkia. The limitations of interpreting phylogenetic status of characters despite the availability of a well-documented phylogeny of the species are discussed.
10.2307/1218600| On the basis of many similarities in taxonomical characters the genera Eranthis and Helleborus are combined in the subtribe Helleborinae, Ranunculaceae. Former investigations in comparative serology indicated, that this close relationship can be dubious. This work confirms earlier findings: in serological characters Eranthis is more similar to Actaea/Cimicifuga than to Helleborus. Although Helleborus itself seems to have much in common with Eranthis, it shows unexpected strong similarities with achene-fruited or annual members of the Ranunculaceae (Myosurus, Adonis, Consolida) too. These results cannot be caused by undifferentiated embryos in mature seeds of Eranthis. Even fully developed embryos show the same antigenic pattern until the beginning of germination. An overall revision of the subtribe Helleborinae is suggested. /// [German] Die Gattungen Eranthis und Helleborus werden aufgrund vieler Merkmalshnlichkeiten zur Subtribus Helleborinae zusammengefasst. Frhere vergleichend-serologische Untersuchungen haben Zweifel angemeldet, ob eine derart enge Verwandtschaft angenommen werden darf. In der vorliegenden Arbeit werden jene abweichenden serologischen Befunde besttigt: Eranthis hat grssere serologische hnlichkeiten mit Actaea/Cimicifuga als mit Helleborus. Helleborus seinerseits scheint zwar besondere serologische Merkmalsgemeinsamkeiten mit Eranthis zu besitzen, zeigt andererseits aber eigenartigerweise mit z.T. nsschenfrchtigen, insbesondere annuellen Ranunculaceen (Myosurus, Adonis, Consolida) auffallende bereinstimmungen. Das abweichende Verhalten von Eranthis kann nicht dadurch erklrt werden, dass zur Samenreife die Embryonen noch weitgehend undifferenziert sind. Auch sptere, vollentwickelte Stadien besassen, soweit nachweisbar, das gleiche Antigenmuster; erst zur Keimung treten erhebliche Vernderungen auf. 
10.2307/1218601|Hyphal morphology has been used by various authors to define sooty mold Ascomycete taxa and to establish pleomorphic relationships between sexually and asexually reproducing species occurring together in a naturally developed colony. Evidence is presented to indicate that the presence of hyphal ornamentation is an unreliable taxonomic character. Reports in the literature of pleomorphic relationships based on culture work are reviewed. It is concluded that experimental evidence must be obtained to support taxonomic use of hyphal morphology data taken from sooty mold colonies developed in Nature.
10.2307/1218602|Summit Garden in the Panama Canal Zone has been important for its contributions to research in plant introduction and utilization, horticulture and general botanical science. Many famous men of botany have been contributors to its endeavors. Botanical research waned following the war when the Garden became essentially a beautiful public park. With the establishment of Summit Herbarium & Library this year, scientific research is again active at the Garden.
10.2307/1219215|The role of taxonomists -- in the total social structure as well as the academic subculture -- is evidenced by their disappearance.
10.2307/1219216|The criteria for an efficient system for data-banking are reviewed. The efficiency is seen in the light of the problems of modest computer facilities, reducing the time for data capture, and having the simplest operating procedures that can meet most of the likely demands of the user. A program-package developed to meet these criteria is described. The data are primarily those associated with specimen labels. Several directory files are used for abbreviated codings to give record compression. A simple system of instructions is used to retrieve records with desired characteristics and from them to give results in a variety of forms, including ordered listings with frequencies and geographical distribution maps. Full checking and editing facilities, with corrective error-messages, are available for all critical operations. Experience with the system suggests a favourable cost/benefit relationship for work with special collections.

10.2307/1219219|Three types of serological precipitin techniques were employed, using seed extracts from selected monocotyledonous species and antisera to Typha and Sparganium. The obtained protein data were evaluated for use in helping to determine the placement of the Typhales within the monocotyledons. Data indicated the following: (1) significantly high serological correspondence between Typha and Sparganium, supporting the placement of these two genera within the order Typhales; (2) low serological correspondence between the Typhales and Liliales (in addition to some anomalous activity), indicating possible distant evolutionary relationships between these two orders; and (3) little or no serological correspondence between the Typhales and most of the tested monocotyledons, reflecting an isolated position for the Typhales within the monocotyledons.
10.2307/1219220| Yellow carotenoids were recovered quantitatively from fresh petals of Polymnia maculata, P. uvedalia, and their reciprocal hybrids, as well as from fresh pollen of each parent and one of the hybrid plants. Thin-layer chromatographic resolution, spectrophotometric measurements, partitional segregation both before and following saponification, chemical exploration for relative position of hydroxyl groups and for the presence of epoxy structures, and establishment of co-sorbability of comparative fractions led to several conclusions: (1) The prominent fraction in all four experimental categories of petal carotenoids is a variously esterified polyhydroxy, monoepoxy derivative of -carotene; this, with minor, allied congeners of other esterified xanthophylls, constituted some 94 to 98% of total petal carotenoids. (2) The minor remaining, persistently epiphasic component yielded two chief fractions: a non-epoxy and an epoxy-carotene derivative. (3) Pollen samples each yielded a single molecular species of carotenoid which was an epiphasic, non-saponifiable, non-epoxy compound suggesting a dehydrocarotene derivative. (4) The relatively simple carotenoid complexes recovered from the reproductive parts of both supposed species of Polymnia, as well as from their hybrids, are so closely similar as to lend support to the alternative view that they may be conspecific. 
10.2307/1219222| Chromosome numbers are summarized within a novel taxonomic framework for the 22 genera of the primitive angiosperm family Annonaceae in which they are known. Chromosomal data are shown to be consistent with the author's concept of the phylogeny of the family, as independently determined from a study of pollen and floral morphology. This independently derived infrafamilial phylogeny suggests that there have been minimally 12 separate changes in base chromosome number within the family. Evidence is strong for considering x = 7 as the base chromosome number for the family, with parallel ascending aneuploidy: n = 789. Considerable parallel polyploidy has occurred on the older x = 7, polyploidy has occurred at least once on x = 8, while the most recent aneuploid number, x = 9, has not produced any polyploids as far as is known. Chromosome numbers, as well as pollen and floral morphology, are adduced to support the author's conclusion that the Annonaceae are of New World (and/or possibly African) origin. The significance of chromosome evolution within the Annonaceae is discussed as it bears on the choice of the basic chromosome number for the angiosperms (x = 7). Finally, the first chromosome count, n = 8, is presented for the annonaceous genus Desmopsis Saff. 
10.2307/1219224|The mechanisms of chromosome pairing are poorly understood. Yet, pairing during meiotic prophase is commonly assumed to indicate homology, and absence of pairing non-homology between parental genomes. These assumptions lead to the widely accepted belief that data on chromosome pairing in hybrids provide indisputable evidence of degree of phylogenetic affinity between the parental taxa involved. Chromosome pairing usually, but not always, is a valid source of information on relationships in diploid hybrids, but rarely if ever provides conclusive evidence on affinities when polyploid taxa are involved.
10.2307/1219225|Where there are many taxonomically useful characters occurring in some but not all OTUs ("inapplicable characters"), the resultant "distortion" of character-space may be troublesome in interpreting the similarity matrix. In numerical taxonomic work at and above the generic level considerable inapplicability of characters due to "missing organs" cannot be avoided. A solution may be to provide a hierarchical ordering of characters such that similarity is calculated over never-missing "primary" characters whose scores are modified according to the similarities of their dependent characters (secondary, tertiary etc.). This, however, has the effect of "weighting" primary characters such that their presence/absence must always override the contribution of the secondary character scores. It is not evident that this is necessarily desirable, but an empirical examination of the method on three sets of data has produced reasonably acceptable results.
10.2307/1219226|A simplified method for computing Wagner Trees is presented, with discussion of the type of characters used. The application of this method, and its use in inducing phylogeny, is given using Helenium L. sect. Tetrodus (Cass.) DC. as an example.
10.2307/1219227|The highly effective insecticide dichlorvos may be harmful to humans under certain herbarium conditions, but the danger can be minimized by using it occasionally as a space treatment rather than constantly as a protectant. Lindane is less effective, more persistant and toxic, and should not be used in herbaria.
10.2307/1219229|The importance of hybridization in speciation is emphasized by listing most of the known intergeneric hybrids in flowering plants and including a figure (23,675) of all the known hybrids including interspecife ones. No claims are made that the list is complete or absolutely accurate. Some of the strong points regarding hybridization as a process are given. In addition, it is pointed out that hybrids, throughout the range, show both dominance and intermediacy, some possess normal meiosis and many are highly or partially fertile.
10.2307/1219231|The attempts by contemporaries of J. W. Hornemann (1770-1841) to commemorate him in the generic name Hornemannia resulted, for taxonomic and nomenclatural reasons, only in the creation of synonyms. Hornemannia Willd. (1809) was based on two species, one now referred to Mazus Lour. (1790), the other to Lindernia All. (1766). It prohibits the use of Hornemannia Vahl (1810) for a West Indian genus of Ericaceae subfam. Vaccinioideae, now to be called Symphysia C. B. Presl (1827), and of Hornemannia Benth. (1846) for an East Asiatic genus of Scrophulariaceae, now called Ellisiophyllum Maxim. (1871). Symphysia apparently comprises only one species, S. racemosa (Vahl) Stearn, first described as Hornemannia racemosa Vahl, which, being a montane little-known plant, has been named anew from almost every West Indian island it inhabits.

10.2307/1219234|Many of the functions traditionally carried out by botanic gardens have now become the responsibility of other organisations. Nevertheless, relatively few changes have occurred in the structure and activities of most botanic gardens, and special consideration needs to be given to the particular part that they should play in botanical and horticultural developments. The functions of a botanic garden may be summarily described under the headings, investigation, conservation, education and demonstration, and these headings are used as starting points for a discussion on the role of botanic gardens in general, and the ways in which different gardens might co-ordinate their activities with each other, and with other organisations with closely related interests.
10.2307/1219236| Cytological, cytogenetical, ecological, geographical and morphological aspects of differentiation in the Arabis hirsuta species aggregate are summarized in order to elucidate the evolution and phylogeny of this group in Central Europe. All species involved are self-compatible. A. planisiliqua (Pers.) Reichenb. (s.l.), A. sagittata (Bertol.) DC. and A. allionii DC. (s.l.) are in the main diploids (2n = 16), and have originated by divergent differentiation. A. hirsuta (s. str.) is an allotetraploid (2n = 32); its possible descent from A. sagittata (Bertol.) DC.  A. ciliata Clairv. is discussed. The latter diploid species must be placed outside of the aggregate; nevertheless, experimental production of the hybrid with A. sagittata and its polyploidization has succeeded. The synthesized allotetraploid is rather similar to A. hirsuta (s. str.) but not identical with it. Further investigations are in progress. 
10.2307/1219237|Nine genera of fossil palm and palm-like leaves are recognized in this study. Amesoneuron H. R. Goeppert, Bactrites E. W. Berry, Palmacites A. Brongniart, Phoenicites A. Brongniart, and Sabalites G. Saporta are considered to be true palms. Some specimens, because of their uniquely recognizable characteristics, have been identified with the modern genus Phoenix Linnaeus. Sanmiguelia R. W. Brown, Paloreodoxites F. Knowlton and Propalmophyllum O. Lignier are also included in this study because of their superficial resemblance to palms. However, they lack one or more characters essential for their recognition as true palms (i.e. hastula, primary costa, and two orders of venation paralleling a prominent but uniform mid-vein in the individual segments). A diagnostic key and a synopsis of accepted form and organ genera, with appropriate synonymies and new combinations complete the paper. A list of genera to be excluded from the Palmae is appended.
10.2307/1219239|Agostino Todaro, noted Italian botanist and first monographer of Gossypium, added 79 names to the literature of this genus (from subgeneric to varietal rank) in a series of overlapping and redundant publications in the 1860's and 1870's. These works, mostly rare, have been inaccurately and confusingly cited in subsequent literature. A bibliographic analysis of these works was therefore made to provide unequivocal citations of the sources, to ascertain their dates of publication, and to list the correct bibliographic citation for each of the names published in them.
10.2307/1219241|It is suggested by Stafleu in "Taxonomic Literature," entry 96, that "Herbarium Blackwellianum" may have been published in instalments. This is confirmed by reviews and by some of the six "prefaces", which are actually epilogues issued on completion of the text for each nominal one hundred plates. Further, from 1750 onwards the text was published after the plates. Approximate dates of publication of plates and of text are given. The work should not therefore be quoted as being published in six parts or centuries but in forty eight (?) instalments of plates, with the text accompanying some of these instalments.

10.2307/1218190|Given a resource gradient (e.g. light intensity, prey size) in a community, species evolve to use different parts of this gradient; competition between them is thereby reduced. Species relationships in the community may be conceived in terms of a multidimensional coordinate system, the axes of which are the various resource gradients (and other aspects of species relationships to space, time, and one another in the community). This coordinate system defines a hyperspace, and the range of the space that a given species occupies is its niche hypervolume, as an abstract characterization of its intra-community position, or niche. Species evolve toward difference in niche, and consequently toward difference in location of their hypervolumes in the niche hyperspace. Through evolutionary time additional species can fit into the community in niche hypervolumes different from those of other species, and the niche hyperspace can become increasingly complex. Its complexity relates to the community's richness in species, its alpha diversity. Species differ in the proportions of the niche hyperspace they are able to occupy and the share of the community's resources they utilize. The share of resources utilized is expressed in species' productivities, and when species are ranked by relative productivity (or some other measurement) from most to least important, importance-value or dominance-diversity curves are formed. Three types of curves may represent manners in which resources are divided among species: (a) niche pre-emption with strong dominance, expressed in a geometric series, (b) random boundaries between niches, expressed in the MacArthur distribution, and (c) determination of relative importance by many factors, so that species form a frequency distribution on a logarithmic base of importance values, a lognormal distribution. The forms of importance-value curves do not permit strong inference about resource division, but are of interest for their expression of species relationships and bearing on measurement of diversity. Two aspects of alpha diversity are to be measured. Diversity in the strict sense is richness in species, and is appropriately measured as the number of species in a sample of standard size. Slope measurements, in contrast, express the steepness of the importance-value sequence. Of the slope measurements the Simpson index expresses dominance or relative concentration of the importance values into the first or first few species, whereas the Shannon-Wiener index expresses the relative evenness or equitability of the importance values through the whole sequence. A new index, expressing equitability as number of species per logarithmic cycle of the importance-value sequence, is suggested. Given a habitat gradient (e.g. elevation or soil moisture conditions) species evolve to occupy different positions along this gradient. The various habitat gradients of a landscape may also be conceived as a multidimensional hyperspace, and species evolve toward occupation of different positions in this hyperspace. Along a particular habitat gradient species populations have scattered centers and usually overlap broadly, forming a community continuum or coenocline. Through evolutionary time additional species can fit themselves in along the coenocline. As they do so the extent of change in community composition along the gradient increases. The extent of differentiation of communities along habitat gradients is beta diversity. The total or gamma diversity of a landscape, or geographic area, is a product of the alpha diversity of its communities and the degree of beta differentiation among them. The species' position in a landscape of communities, as described in terms of both habitat and niche relationships, may be termed its ecotope. Two approaches to measuring beta diversity have been most useful. For a transect along a given coenocline, the degree of species turnover or compositional change may be measured through sample similarities and expressed as half-changes. When a set of samples are taken to represent differences in communities of a landscape or range of habitat along more than one habitat axis, beta differentiation for these samples may be expressed by the ratio of the total number of species represented in the samples to the mean number per sample. Diversity of communities seems a resultant of non-extreme conditions, stable conditions, evolutionary and successional time, and the kind of community developed in that time. It is difficult to separate the effects of chronic environmental rigor, amplitude of regular fluctuation, and irregularity or unpredictableness of fluctuation. Diversities are low in many unstable environments, but certain desert communities subject to wide and irregular variation in precipitation have evolved high diversities in relation to this variation. Evolutionary time is difficult to measure, but is important as the dimension through which increase in alpha and beta diversity occurs. Alpha diversities of birds, and gamma diverstities of islands, appear to reach saturation or steady-state levels. It is suggested, however, that for terrestrial plants and insects increase of species diversity, with elaboration of the niche hyperspace and division of the habitat hyperspace, is a self-augmenting evolutionary process without any evident limit.
10.2307/1218192|Species diversity, here defined simply as the total number of species in a community, represents the historic processes by which additional species enter the community and species disappear from it. The additions arise chiefly through speciation by geographic isolation followed by a congregation of the new species formed. The mechanism is by reversible geologic events such as glacial periods, orogenies, and dispersal corridors, the first two affecting organisms as reversible climatic changes. These events cause speciation on a grand scale, acting simultaneously on species in all seral stages of the biome. On this basis, the input side of the species diversity of a community is a combined function of (1) the geologic longevity of its ecological conditions and (2) the number of times the community area undergoes geographic disjunctions and reconnections.
10.2307/1218194|Various kinds of data concerning changes in total mammalian ordinal and familial diversity through the Cenozoic are graphed for the world and for each of the continents from which a mammalian fossil record is known. Ordinal and familial diversity increased rapidly through the Paleocene and Eocene to reach respective all-time highs of 26 orders in the late Eocene and 116 families in the early Oligocene (bats and odontocete plus mysticete whales excluded). The major continents suffered a decline in total ordinal and familial diversity in the latter half of the Oligocene with a secondary rejuvenation in the early Miocene. A remarkable uniformity in total number of orders and families per continent has obtained from the early Oligocene to Recent, and no apparent relationship exists between total diversity and continental size. A series of striking correlations exists between the times of first appearances of many mammalian and angiospermous orders and families. High numbers of first appearances (a kind of index to rates of evolutionary diversification) occurred in both mammals and flowering plants in the late Eocene to early Oligocene and in the earlier half of the Miocene. These specific times of high taxonomic diversification also correlate closely with the times of first appearance of "modern" (present at some time during the Quaternary) families of mammals and extinction of archaic families. Major mammalian faunal "turn-overs" occurred in the Late Cretaceous, Eocene through early Oligocene, and early Miocene. Nevertheless, total familial and ordinal diversity of mammals on any given continent at any given time has remained remarkably stable. Some sort of faunal equilibrium is suggested. The dramatic taxonomic changes of the earlier parts of the Oligocene (i. e., high rates of appearance of new mammalian and plant taxa plus high rate of extinction of archaic mammals) correlate well with a general deterioration of the world's climate (lowering of mean annual temperature and decrease of equability) ar that time. Contemporaneous adjustments can be observed between climatic change, rates of evolutionary diversification in plants and mammals, and rates of extinction in mammals.
10.2307/1218195|Patterns of species diversity and equitability, and the hypotheses suggested to explain them are examined in the terrestrial and marine environments, and the fossil record. Although all the hypotheses are important in explaining diversity, none of them singularly or in various combinations are sufficient to explain the observed patterns. Quantification of the variables suggested to explain the observations will no doubt help clarify and give more credibility to the explanation of diversity, but such studies are only in their infancy.
10.2307/1218196| The "Systematisch-Geobotanisches Institut" of the University of Gttingen acquired as a gift the herbarium of the former Royal Gardens at Herrenhausen near Hannover. This herbarium contains plants from F. Ehrhart, types of plants described by Johann Christoph Wendland, Heinrich Ludolph Wendland and Hermann Wendland. Of importance is further the material collected by Hermann Wendland during his journey to Central America in 1856/57. 
10.2307/1218200|It is proposed that Article 48 and Note of Article 51, of the International Code of Nomenclature of Cultivated Plants -- 1969, be deleted, and that Article 44 be amended. This proposal is based on the principle that a cultivar name never loses its importance even if the cultivar is not grown any more. It is also strongly recommended that Registries be done on a world-wide basis. A few examples taken from oat cultivars are given to illustrate the problem.
10.2307/1218202|The original Galax aphylla of Linnaeus included two quite distinct plants, one of which is usually referred to Diapensiaceae and the other to Hydrophyllaceae, and the latter must be taken as the type of the name. The generic name is now conserved in the former sense, but it is proposed that it should be cited as Galax Sims and not as Galax Rafinesque, or else that Solenandria Ventenat should be added to the list of rejected names. The correct name for the species commonly known as G. aphylla L. is shown to be G. urceolata (Poir.) Brummitt, comb. nov., and notes are given on the early discovery of the species and its introduction into cultivation in Europe. The family name Galacaceae D. Don, which has been considered illegitimate, is found to be legitimate and available for use if Galax is separated from Diapensiaceae. The original Galax aphylla L. is transferred to Nemophila (Hydrophyllaceae) as N. aphylla (L.) Brummitt, comb. nov., the correct name for the plant long known as N. microcalyx (Nutt.) Fisch. & Mey.
10.2307/1218204|The modern concept of Ceuthospora Fries (1825), originally described with two species, has largely been based on the two later species of Greville (1827). Fries (1832) effectively selected C. phaeocomes (Rebent. ex Fr.) Fr. as the lectotype of Ceuthospora, a generic name which is earlier than Pyrenophora Fries (1849), an obligate nomenclatural synonym. The alternative, which is to typify Ceuthospora by C. inclusa (Schmidt & Kunze ex Fr.) Fr. places the genus in the Mycelia Sterilia. It is suggested that by conserving Ceuthospora Greville (1827), lectotype species C. lauri (Greville) Greville, against Ceuthospora Fries (1825), lectotype species C. phaeocomes (Rebent. ex Fr.) Fr., the nomenclature of Pyrenophora Fries, a common genus of plant pathogens, and Ceuthospora will be stabilised according to usage extending from 1869 and 1827 respectively to the present.
10.2307/1218205|Pilophorus Th. Fr. must be regarded as a valid generic name, and "Pilophoron (Tuck.) Th. Fr." rejected. Pilophoron (Tuck.) Tuck. is a synonym of Pilophorus Th. Fr. The lectotypification of both of these names is discussed.
10.2307/1219102| Biological taxonomy, now combined with cytogenetics and mathematical philosophy, has become a new synthetic theory of evolution. The purpose of this paper is to derive a comprehensive, united series of formal descriptions of the results of evolution, which are the systematic categories as understood by biosystematics. In a first move, differences between individuals are found by comparing their chromosomal arrangements, and algebraic measures of feasibility of pairing are derived. Individuals are also compared with regard to their genes, and an algebraic measure of genic similarity between individuals is defined. A chain is also defined, which unites in clusters the groups of individuals which are equivalent with regard to a relation which is to be defined in each case. With these mathematical tools, a species is defined as a group of individuals which cluster when one applies on them a relation showing their possibility of crossing freely. A genus is defined as a group of species which cluster after a chain is formed on pairs of species between which there is a calculated possibility of occasional hybridization. A local population is defined as a group of organisms located within pairing distance of each other. A subspecies is defined as a major subdivision of the specific gene pool which corresponds to a geographical subdivision of the species' range. The usefulness of the semispecies as a category different from the subspecies is discussed according to biosystematic principles. It is also suggested that an environmental multi-dimensional space could be of major usefulness for determining the major adaptive peaks reached by supra-generic taxa. /// [French] La taxonomie biologique, qui s'appuie maintenant sur la cytogntique et la philosophie mathmatique, est devenue une nouvelle thorie synthtique de l'volution. Ce travail prsente une srie de descriptions formelles des rsultats de l'volution; ces rsultats sont les catgories systmatiques telles que comprises par la biosystmatique. En premier lieu, les diffrences entre individus sont tablies par comparaison de leurs chromosomes et leur capacit d'accouplement est dcrite algbriquement. La comparaison des gnes des individus mne  une mesure algbrique de la similarit gnique des individus. On dfinit aussi une chane qui groupe les individus qu'une relation ( dterminer dans chaque cas) dfinit comme quivalents.  l'aide de ces instruments mathmatiques, les individus qui se groupent lorsqu'on leur applique une relation montrant leur capacit de croisement, sont dfinis comme formant une espce. Les espces qui se groupent  l'aide d'une chane montrant leur capacit de former occasionnellement des hybrides, sont dfinies comme formant un genre. La population locale est dfinie comme un groupe d'organismes situs  proximit suffisante les uns des autres pour qu'ils puissent s'accoupler. La sous-espce est dfinie comme une subdivision gntique majeure de l'espce qui correspond de plus  une subdivision gographique. L'utilit de la semi-espce comme catgorie diffrente de la sous-espce est value selon les principes biosystmatiques. L'on suggre aussi qu'un espace cologique multi-dimensionnel pourrait tre trs utile pour dterminer quels sont les sommets volutifs atteints par les taxa de niveau supra-gnrique. 
10.2307/1219103|Juniperus pinchotii Sudw. was analyzed for areas of population differentiation and possible hybridization with other species of Juniperus, utilizing both morphological and chemical (terpenoid) characters. The volatile terpenoids of the foliage were analyzed by gas chromatography. Numerical methods included: analysis of variance; SNK tests; contour mapping of individual characters; differential systematics; and numerical taxonomy. Juniperus pinchotii appears to be a somewhat variable taxon with some quite divergent populations in the trans-Pecos region of west Texas where it is morphologically similar to J. monosperma Sarg. No evidence of introgression was detected but some hybridization with J. monosperma in the Palo Duro Canyon of the Texas Panhandle was confirmed.
10.2307/1219105|Critiques are presented of the three main precepts of vascular conservatism, viz.: (1) extent of fusion of bundles denotes degree of evolutionary advancement; (2) 'vestigial traces' indicate organs that have disappeared because vascular patterns lag behind in evolution; and (3) orientation of bundles demonstrates homologies. Precepts (2) and (3) can be controverted to a large extent by existing reports in the literature. Precept (1) is herewith tested by an analysis of the level and manner of origin of the dorsal carpellary bundles of four species of Syzygium s.l. (Myrtaceae). These features are very variable in an individual plant and even in a single flower. Consequently, the extent of union between bundles, contrary to widespread belief, is not necessarily a reliable indicator of phyletic status of an organ or taxon. There is no a priori reason to expect hypotheses based upon conservatism to apply to all situations. The only ultimate test is correlation with other lines of evidence.
10.2307/1219106|Stomatal and other epidermal features suggest a close relationship among the Magnoliaceae, Eupomatiaceae, Degeneriaceae, and Himantandraceae, a somewhat more distant relationship of the Winteraceae to these families, and only a much more distant relationship of the Illiciaceae and Trochodendraceae to this group. Epidermal characteristics of the various genera and species of the Magnoliaceae are highly compatible with the taxonomic scheme of Dandy, and in some respects give strong support to it. The generic separation of Manglietia from Magnolia is particularly supported by my studies. Within the Winteraceae, epidermal features of several species of Belliolum correlate well with the system of A. C. Smith for this genus. The species Bubbia perrieri is anomalous in Bubbia on epidermal features, though clearly a member of the Winteraceae; its taxonomic position merits reconsideration. Many members of the Magnoliales have thickened lamellae (distinct from the outer stomatal ledge) on the outer walls of the guard cells, similar (except in not being lignified) to such lamellae in the modern Cycadales. The presence of these lamellae is considered to be a primitive feature among the angiosperms. Thick-walled epidermal cells with pores in the outer wall are found in many of the Magnoliales, and this feature is also considered to be primitive within the angiosperms. It is noteworthy that the Cycadales also have thick-walled cells, and that in Cycas and some other genera these cells have pores in the outer walls. The vast majority of the Magnoliales have paracytic stomates, and this is considered to be the primitive type within the angiosperms.
10.2307/1219108|Results of Reitsma's detailed investigation of "Alangium" pollen appear to differ markedly from conclusions obtained with other systematic approaches, but the contradictions largely disappear when allowance is made for the occasional independent origin of similar pollen characters in related taxa. Objections are raised to certain points in Reitsma's treatment of the fossil record.
10.2307/1219110|Genetic affinities are reported between 6 Hawaiian taxa of Bidens and one species (B. ahnnei) indigenous to the Marquesas Islands. An argument is presented supporting the long-distance dispersal of Bidens from the New World to the Hawaiian Islands, and the later dispersal of this stock to the islands of Southeastern Polynesia.

These findings were checked against a copy in original wrappers. 
10.2307/1219132|The Committee recommends conservation of 975 Iphigenia, 7305 Micromeria, 3899 Flemingia, 3910 Dolichos, and 1095a Leopoldia. It does not recommend conservation of sub 9061 Vicoa, 3392 Osmaronia, 7364 Moschosma or sub 3899 Maughania. It holds that the conservation of 794 Spirodela is unnecessary because the so-called earlier synonym is in fact a synonym of Lemna. A proposal to conserve post 2405 Cryophytum has been withdrawn.
10.2307/1219154|A method is described for the rapid and accurate collection of descriptive taxonomic data for use in computer applications to taxonomy by using a computer driven display. Considerable savings of time and labour were achieved when the method was applied to descriptions of the microspecies of Rubus fruticosus.
10.2307/1219155|Using the six diploid species of Clarkia section Myxocarpa as exemplifying rapidly-evolved, chromosomally-based reproductive isolates, the temporal relationships of adaptive and reproductive divergence are examined. Unlike the more familiar pattern, in which adaptive divergence is greater at the interspecific level than at the intraspecific level, two of the species consist of subspecies which have adaptively diverged to a greater extent than has any Myxocarpa species from its putative progenitor. This indicates that the tempo and degree of adaptive change are relatively independent of the establishment of reproductive isolation, and indeed that the establishment of reproductive isolation by rapid chromosomal reorganization may not be coincidental with much change in adaptive level. Evidence bearing on the tempo of adaptive change prior to, during, and subsequent to the evolution of chromosomal isolates is examined. It is speculated that increased adaptation may frequently evolve prior to the establishment of chromosomal reorganization, because chromosomal isolates usually evolve from populations which have survived for a period of time in an especially stressful environment. Occasionally, less-adapted chromosomal isolates, generated through genetic drift, may temporarily compete succesfully against a better-adapted progenitor because of the competitive exclusion which occurs between intersterile populations which readily form F
10.2307/1219157| The problem of producing a classification from data gathered on specimens has two main components: first the information about the specimens must be structured as characters and character states in such a way that it carries the most information about the taxonomic structure of the objects under study, the mathematical 'noise' being eliminated as much as possible. Then this information must be handled in such a way that a hierarchical partitioning of the objects, called classification, is derived. This paper presents computer-aided methods for the accomplishment of these steps. These methods were worked out to be both mathematically and biologically sound. The character analysis method (called CHARANAL) uses information theory to measure the amount of information common to pairs of characters, and derives from it various measures for the comparison of characters. The clustering technique presented here (entitled GRAPH), on the other hand, is based upon graph theory, and is intended to represent the thought process of the 'classical' taxonomist. For each method are given a general explanation, a detailed explanation of the mathematics involved, an example, and a section on interpretation of results. /// [French] Une classification produite  partir des donnes recueillies sur des spcimens rsulte de deux manipulations successives de ces donnes: il faut d'abord structurer l'information que l'on possde sous la forme de diffrentes descriptions d'un certain nombre de caractres, et faire en sorte que l'information taxonomiquement significative soit prserve et que le brouillage mathmatique soit limin le plus possible. Par la suite cette mme information doit servir  produire une srie hirarchique de partitions des objets sous tude, ce qui s'appelle une classification. Les auteurs prsentent ici pour ce faire des mthodes d'analyse par ordinateur drives de principes biologiques et mathmatiques reconnus. Pour l'analyse des caractres (programme CHARANAL), l'information commune  des paires de caractres est mesure suivant les principes de la thorie de l'information, ce qui permet de driver diffrentes mesures pour la comparaison des caractres. La technique de groupement des objects (programme GRAPH) drive d'autre part de la thorie des graphes et essaie de reproduire aussi fidlement que possible le cheminement de la pense du taxonomiste dit 'classique'.  la suite de l'explication gnrale, on retrouvera une explication dtaille de l'aspect mathmatique, un exemple ainsi qu'une section sur l'interprtation des rsultats, ce pour chacune des deux techniques. 
10.2307/1219158|Two recently proposed measures of the dissimilarity between classifications of a group of organisms are shown to be only pseudometrics when applied to nondichotomous classifications. Modifications of these measures are introduced and proved to have the properties of a true metric.
10.2307/1219160|The use of chemical characteristics in plant taxonomy is briefly surveyed. Some types of numerical treatment of variation in chromatographically separated substances are discussed. The usefulness of such methods is shown to be more restricted than is often claimed. The use of certain index values to illustrate differences between taxa or affinities between them is criticized from a biological point of view. An alternative possibility of the use of variation in chromatographically obtained data is suggested. A modified analysis of variance makes it possible to study population structures and genetical systems within one taxon at a time. Variation arising from irregularities in chromatographical separation, chance, etc., can also be estimated by this method.

10.2307/1219167| Hormidium Ktzing 1843 (non Lindley ex Heynhold 1840, Orchidaceae) is shown to have been lectotypified with H. velutinum, a schizogoniaceous alga. Hormidium sensu Klebs 1896 comprises ulotrichaceous algae. Although intended to apply to ulotrichaceous algae, Chlorhormidium Fott 1960 can be associated only with schizogoniaceous algae inasmuch as the name was proposed as a substitute for Hormidium Ktzing. Klebs's concept of Hormidium is therefore described as a new genus, for which the name Klebsormidium is proposed.

To avoid further confusion due to the rather poor differential characters of O. chinensis and zeylanica in most writings, a set of valuable differential characters is given.

10.2307/1219175|We have been looking up the original publication of all the generic names of the family Gesneriaceae for the "Index Nominum Genericorum". Dr. B. L. Burtt has in various publications chosen lectotypes for many of the Old World genera, but many of the New World ones have not as yet been properly lectotypified. Generally, the proper lectotype is obvious, even though it has not been formally designated, and these we have chosen here. There are only a few names, like Diplocalyx K. B. Presl (still wholly dubious), Orobanchia Vandelli (also dubious), and Gesnera Mart. (non L.) that must remain 'provisional' for the time being.
10.2307/1218031|Computerized information systems which create, maintain and extract data from files of structured information share common processing characteristics regardless of the application to which they are being applied. Implementation and maintenance of such a system is greatly facilitated by the use of packages of generalized computer programs which are designed to perform all of the traditional information handling functions and which can be readily adapted to a wide range of data storage and search requirements. Such program packages minimize cost of system implementation and permit limited resources to be dedicated to the storage of data and the operation of the system rather than to its development. To illustrate the characteristics and capabilities of such program packages, one example, the IBM Generalized Information System (GIS) is examined in some detail.

10.2307/1218121|Two new divisive strategies for hierarchical classification are reported. Both use a form of 'directed search' to limit the number of possible polythetic splits examined. An objective method for testing the accuracy of divisions is defined. Preliminary results of tests of the two new methods against certain existing techniques have shown the former to produce superior divisions.
10.2307/1218122|The biosynthetic pathways leading to the major groups of secondary metabolites isolated from the Zanthoxylum/Fagara complex are reviewed and there is shown to be a common precursor in chorismic acid. The use of the compounds as chemotaxonomic markers is discussed and they are found to support the concept of a direct link between the Rutaceae and ranalian stock. The potential value of the secondary metabolites in chemosystematic analysis within the family is also briefly discussed. The alkaloids, coumarins, flavanoids and lignans of the taxa Zanthoxylum and Fagara are examined in detail and the distribution found to support authorities who have expressed the view that these taxa are congeneric (Zanthoxylum s.l.). The chemosystematics of Zanthoxylum s.l. indicates that the genus is primitive within the family. The secondary metabolites of Zanthoxylum s.l. are used to construct a putative phylogeny of the genus and its possible "key" position in the evolution of the family is speculated upon. It is noted that the Englerian classification of Zanthoxylum s.l., and of the Rutaceae in general, appears to be unsatisfactory.
10.2307/1218124|Ultrastructural analysis of sieve tubes of Hamamelididae (48 species from 16 families and 12 of the 15 orders investigated) showed a rather uniform distribution of S-type plastids (storing starch only) among this subclass. P-type plastids (storing protein) were reported only for the genus Ulmus. Some other species belonging to the Urticales contain sieve-tube plastids storing neither starch nor protein; however, the scarce formation of minute starch grains in at least two species of the latter group joins them to the S-type plastids.
10.2307/1218125| Duchesne's "Manuel de Botanique" (Paris, 1764) contains the first publication of Bernard de Jussieu's natural system, the only one that appeared during Bernard's lifetime. Buisson's "Classes et noms des plantes" (Paris, 1779) and Durande's "Notions lmentaires de Botanique" (Dijon, 1781) include publications of Antoine-Laurent's 1774 system, which constituted an intermediary stage between Bernard's method and that of the 1789 "Genera plantarum", and in accordance with which the botany school in Paris was replanted. 
10.2307/1218127|The identity of the species of Oncidium described by Jacquin (under Epidendrum) in his Enumeratio (1760) and in his Selectarum stirpium (1763) is discussed. The choice of Epidendrum altissimum as the lectotype of the generic name Oncidium -- originally made in 1874 -- is upheld.
10.2307/1218129|A synopsis of the historical background of the orchid genus Schomburgkia Lindl., considered largely in terms of the contributions of the five major botanists who described its species. A complete bibliography for the genus is also provided.
10.2307/1218131| Misidentification of fossil monocolpate pollen with the species Pollenites tranquillus Potoni is disclosed. This species has been used as the type-species of the generic names Monocolpopollenites and Palmaepollenites. The genus Monocolpopollenites Thomson & Pflug 1953 is emended; and Palmaepollenites Potoni 1958, Rectosulcites Anderson 1960, and Punctamonocolpites Pierce 1961 are placed in synonymy with it. Arecipites Wodehouse 1933 is emended; Calamuspollenites Elsik in Stover et al. 1966 is placed in synonymy with Arecipites, and A. pertusus (Elsik in Stover et al. 1966) nov. comb., type-species of Calamuspollenites, is emended. Distinction between Arecipites and Liliacidites Couper 1953 is reaffirmed. Three new species of Monocolpopollenites and one new species of Arecipites are described, and ten new combinations are proposed. 
10.2307/1218132|By invoking Article 70 of the Code, it is proposed that the name, Prionodon luteovirens (Tayl.) Mitt. be retained in place of P. dichotomus Hampe. The original description of P. dichotomus is emended, and at the same time the name is removed from possible synonymy under P. luteo-virens.
10.2307/1218133|A proposal is made to abolish the requirement of a separate generic diagnosis for the validation of names of new monotypic genera or fossil plants based on a new species and published on or after 1 January 1953.
10.2307/1218138|Flora Fluminensis was written by Fra J. M. da C. Vellozo at the end of the 18th century but it was published only later, after the author's death. In 1825 three fourths of the text was printed, up to Sabbata romana, p. 1-352, but it remained stored in the Typographia Nacional for four years. The sale of this incomplete text began on a date in 1829 that is difficult to determine precisely. Perhaps because the text remained unfinished, distribution was interrupted between 1832 and 1833, but it was reinitiated in 1834. By 1838 the book was almost out of print. The complete text was published in 1881, as a second edition. The effective date of Vellozo's species described in the first unfinished edition lies between September 7 and November 28, 1829.
10.2307/1219321|The coefficient of relevance R
10.2307/1219322|There are several kinds of criteria for determining whether an average family of insects is comparable to an average family of mammals. Different combinations of criteria are appropriate for different purposes and give different results. A new metataxonomic criterion is explored for all phyla of animals and plants and for various subordinate taxa. Differences in it can be caused by sampling error, different degrees of splitting, and different patterns of evolution; these causes are more or less confounded but indicate the domain of the criterion's applicability. Body weight and other factors affect the number of species in genera and families. It is not yet known to what extent boundaries between taxa correspond to real subcontinuities in properties of the organisms. We should know what characters are, or have been, important to an organism, even for angiosperms, where little research has been directed at the problem as formulated here.
10.2307/1219324|As the work of one man, the Martindale herbarium was a remarkable achievement. By the 1880's, Isaac C. Martindale (1842-1893), the Quaker botanist, of Camden, New Jersey, had brought together a vast herbarium, reputed at the time to be one of the largest private herbaria amassed in this country during the 19th century. After he died, the Martindale herbarium was sold in 1894 to the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science. For the next 70 years the collection was largely forgotten and only rarely consulted.
10.2307/1219326|The tribal affinities and inter-relationships of the Californian-Chilean Blennosperma and the western American Crocidium (Compositae) have been the subject of controversy since the mid-nineteenth century. Most recent workers have placed Blennosperma in the Helenieae and Crocidium in the Senecioneae. Investigations of the flavonoids of these genera indicate that at the generic level both contain quercetin-3-0-galactoside, (probably isomeric) quercetin-3-0-glucoside, a quercetin-3-0-polyglucoside, and luteolin-7-0-glucoside. The first two compounds were present in all samples tested, but the other two glycosides were not. These striking biochemical similarities and the weight of morphological evidence suggest that the two genera are closely related to each other. Both should probably be placed in the Senecioneae.
10.2307/1219327|A hybrid swarm between Heterocentron elegans and H. glandulosum was analyzed using a number of different methods: construction of a hybrid index; factor analysis; flavonoid composition; and pollen fertility. From these various studies, information is presented concerning the extent and significance of hybridization between the two species. In addition, the different methods of analysis are compared in terms of the type of information that they contribute.
10.2307/1219329|C. libanotis, the type species of the monotypic Linnaean genus Cachrys, is proved to comprise 2 genera: Cachrys L. (incl. Prangos Lindl.) and Hippomarathrum Link non P.G. Gaertn., B. Mey. & Scherb. The relevant literature and possible type specimens are discussed. A Burser specimen (with ripe fruits), seen by Linnaeus and determined by him as C. libanotis, is chosen as the best admissible lectotype. This specimen agrees with Cachrys trifida Mill. to which, therefore, the name C. libanotis has to be reinstated. As a result of this typification the generic name Cachrys L. may be retained for the taxa conventionally considered as Cachrys L. or Prangos Lindl., while Hippomarathrum Link, being a later homonym, is proposed for conservation.
10.2307/1219332|Taxonomic and nomenclatural notes on Halophila, supplemental to den Hartog's monograph, clarifying publication of generic synonym Lemnopsis; establishing H. minor as correct name for what has been called H. ovata; reducing H. ovalis var. bullosa and H. madagascariensis to H. minor; and reinstating H. hawaiiana as a species distinct from both H. minor and H. ovalis.
10.2307/1219335|Pichi Sermolli (1972) has cited Mertensia dichotoma (Thunb. ex Murray) Willd. as lectotype of Mertensia Willd. In so doing he has ignored the taxonomic facts on which earlier citation of M. truncata Willd. as type of Mertensia considered as a subgeneric name was based. The facts are briefly re-stated, and the selection of M. truncata as type of the genus defended. Brief notes are added on the genera Sticherus and Hicriopteris of Presl. A general objection is made to nomenclatural decisions made without reference to taxonomic considerations.
10.2307/1219336|"Algae Terrae Novae", an exsiccata of benthic marine algae from Newfoundland and Labrador, is distributed by the Phycological Herbarium, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada (NFLD). Five annual Sets have been issued since 1968, with a total of 102 specimens; further Sets will be issued annually in future. The species distributed are listed, together with the main recipients of each Set.
10.2307/1218627|Two species groups of the closely knit South American section of the genus Perezia occur in the Andes of southern America but differ conspicuously in the number of species they contain, and the habitat and amount of morphological specialization of their constituent species. These differences reflect the contrasting evolutionary histories of the two species groups. The evolutionary mode most significant in forming each group has been, in turn, determined by the age, geographical extent and vicissitudes of the habitat in which each group occurs. In one case, the habitat is old, covers a large continuous geographical area and has remained relatively stable since the arrival of the ancestral stock well before the Pleistocene. In the second case, the habitat is young, of discontinuous and often limited extent and has undergone numerous rapid alterations since its inception at the end of the Pliocene. In the first case the Pereziae have followed a course of phyletic evolution; in the second, a mode of true speciation.
10.2307/1218628|Dimorphic heterostyly is common in the Rubiaceae, distributed throughout the family in a way that suggests that it has evolved repeatedly. In its essentials this heterostyly suggests protandry in which some plants have normal elongation of the styles and others have precocious maturation of the stigmas at a stage of arrested elongation of the styles. It is suggested that the initiation of heterostyly in this family may lie in a modification of the common protandry. High reproductive fitness of the self-pollinating short-styled plants would begin a shift in the population from predominant outcrossing to predominant autogamy, even though the resulting homozygosity might be disadvantageous. This shift might be halted by the addition of diallelic self-incompatibility of the kind regularly found in heterostylous plants. The population would then achieve the stable polymorphism characteristic of dimorphic heterostyly. Additional morphological refinements might accrue in time.
10.2307/1218629|Ruellia is a large, pantropical group of herbs and shrubs that has undergone a long series of changes in classification. Soon after Linnaeus's original description the genus was divided into numerous segregate genera by Nees von Esenbeck and by others. Later Bentham sunk 18 Neesian genera in his expanded concept of Ruellia, and this circumscription has come to be the accepted definition for the plants. Recently Bremekamp revived a number of old segregate groups and described several new ones. He believes Ruellia sensu lato is an unwieldy and unnatural assemblage of taxa. Experimental hybridizations have established the existence of species-complexes (eco-species) and species-groups (comparia) in Ruellia. The latter are genetically isolated from other species-groups, and taxonomically they correspond to certain segregate genera. There is evidence that North American taxa are closely related to tropical species. Since numerous species can be artificially hybridized, application of the ecotype concept may provide a practical means of identifying natural species-groups. Present evidence suggests that Ruellia, as generally understood, is not a natural, phyletic, unit.
10.2307/1218631|Henri Pittier was one of the most important plant collectors in the Republic of Panama during the time of the construction of the Panama Canal by the Americans (1903-1914). The purpose of this paper is to discuss in detail Pittier's botanical activities in the Republic and to include a list of those collections which are type collections.
10.2307/1218633|The nomenclature and typification of the sections of Papaver L. are reviewed and their correct names and synonymies are presented. The following taxa are lectotypified: Sect. Carinatae Fedde, Lectotype species: Papaver macrostomum Boiss. & Huet Sect. Oxytona Bernh., Lectotype species: Papaver orientale L. Sect. Macrantha Elkan, nom. superfl., Lectotype species: Papaver orientale L. [Genus] Calomecon Spach, Lectotype species: Calomecon orientale (L.) Spach (: Papaver orientale L.)
10.2307/1218635|Chrysolarix amabilis (J. Nelson) H. E. Moore and Pseudolarix amabilis (J. Nelson) Rehder have contended as names for the golden larch. The correct name is Pseudolarix kaempferi Gordon, a name which stands in its own right because the type of Pinus kaempferi Lambert, a name cited in synonymy, was excluded from the concept by Gordon.
10.2307/1218637|Generic interrelationships, evolution and ancestry of the family Euphorbiaceae is reviewed from a chromosomal point of view with the world wide data including the author's record of 43 species from the eastern Himalayas. The arrangement of genera is according to Bentham and Hooker's system of classification and repeated references are made to Hutchinson's recent view of tribalism in the family. The family is believed to be polyphyletic having at least two base numbers x = 7 and 13. The other base numbers encountered in the family are x = 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17 and 18 coupling with the well known morphological and taxonomical complexity of the family. The Euphorbiaceae seem to be of Asiatic origin and primitive Phyllantheae may have evolved in the New World. Both polyploidy and aneuploidy are effective in speciation and as much as 48 per cent of the known taxa exhibit polyploidy.
10.2307/1218638|The genera Enallagma and Amphitecna are united. Their union makes advisable the resurrection of Rafinesque's "Dendrosicus" as the name for the combined genus. A conspectus of the species of "Dendrosicus" is given including four new combinations and a discussion of the typification of D. latifolius.
10.2307/1218643|A second edition of Metcalfe and Chalk's "Anatomy of the Dicotyledons" is now being prepared more than 20 years after the first edition was published. The circumstances that led up to the publication of the first edition are described, partly for their historical interest and partly to show the status of systematic anatomy in relation to taxonomy that existed at the time. The second edition is being expanded to include not only the additional data concerning the histology of the vegetative organs that have accumulated since the first edition was published, but also to cover briefly the main taxonomic views concerning the interrelationships of families and other higher taxa that depend on other laboratory disciplines such as the study of palynology, embryology and chemotaxonomy etc., all of which are now accepted as forming parts of the general subject of taxonomy. In the second edition the arrangement of the families will be according to Takhtajan's system.
10.2307/1218081|The study of organic diversity poses problems of inventory taking, of origins, and of selective (adaptive) significance. Increasing diversity during evolutionary history has resulted in the origin of spectacular adaptive innovations and the invasion of new adaptive zones. Important new concepts, such as population thinking, were developed by the students of diversity.
10.2307/1218083|The possible bridges between evolutionary studies at the subspecific and transspecific levels are numerous. Three kinds require particular attention. One kind, which calls for cooperation between population geneticists and paleontologists, consists of comparisons between variation patterns and ecological relationships between living and extinct populations. Favorable organisms for such comparisons, which have been exploited to some degree, are mammals, molluscs, and unicellular plankton organisms having hard shells. A second kind of bridge is based upon biochemical comparisons at various levels of the taxonomic hierarchy, particularly with reference to proteins, since these are the primary products of gene action. Such comparisons are particularly valuable as ways of estimating what kinds of mutations have most often had major evolutionary significance. When making these comparisons, protein molecules should be regarded as complex structures, more analogous to organs at the macroscopic level than to the small molecules which are studied by most chemists who are not biochemists. Only on this basis can sound inferences be made as to the adaptiveness or non-adaptiveness of particular mutational changes. The biochemical bridge can aid in elucidating the evolution of processes of development and metabolism, but is valuable only indirectly for working out particular pathways of phylogeny, since the biochemical nature of extinct common ancestors can never be determined. Finally, comparative morphogenesis may eventually provide a number of very valuable bridges, but at present its potentialities have been very little explored.
10.2307/1218085|Examples of problems that arise from the present lack of an efficient information service for specimen-label data are reviewed. Deficiencies exist in the guidance given to collectors, the provision of local distribution data for environmental and other studies, and in the support given the monographers in locating Types. Basic queries such as on the fauna and flora of a particular area mostly cannot be answered directly, although the data lie close at hand. With respect to label information the museum or herbarium is a data crypt rather than a data bank. Computer-based data-banking offers a solution to these fundamental problems. Selected items of label data can be retrieved and sorted for output in catalogues or lists by the computer, along with tallies and distribution maps. The steps by which one may achieve this are described, together with a review of the chief kinds of computer program-system and sources of advice. The need for careful systems analysis and international standards for recording the data is emphasised.
10.2307/1218086|This survey concerns computer-assisted storage and retrieval of the data of taxonomy and systematic biology. First, specimen data and ecological data are briefly considered. Next, taxon-level information is discussed, with emphasis on the role of the taxonomic hierarchy in information storage and retrieval. Following that background material, some general conditions under which computer processing of taxonomic information can be of benefit are considered, and some specific criteria for comparing and evaluating taxonomic information systems are suggested. As examples of the various approaches to computer processing of taxonomic information, several recent projects are reviewed. Finally, computer-based information networks are considered as a coming development in taxonomic data processing, to supplement but not replace traditional museum collections and publications.
10.2307/1218088|The state of the art in identification of biological specimens by computer is reviewed. Current methods cover construction of diagnostic keys, matching or comparison methods, and probabilistic methods related to Bayes' theorem. There are also methods for reducing the number of characters that need to be used. The methods are compared and actual and possible progress is discussed.
10.2307/1218090|The use of the computer to map and/or plot systematic data is examined in the areas of automatic plotting of taxa's distributions and computer graphic analysis of geographic variation and population differentiation. Automatic plotting of distributional data is discussed in reference to earlier work and present applications in conjunction with the development of the Rapid Access Plant Information Center (RAPIC) of Colorado, (USA). In the area of computer graphic analysis of geographic variation, the following techniques are discussed: contour mapping (2 and 3 dimensional); shading by overprinting; contoured factor analysis; and contoured surface trend analysis. A technique of composite overlay mapping is introduced to systematics and several applications are discussed.
10.2307/1218091|The author asserts that biologists have been quite unrealistic in their predictions of what the computer can do for them in the realm of computerized data banking. With a backdrop of several years of "hands-on" experience in the Flora North America Program, he analyzes the veritable mythology about data banking that has been fostered unwittingly by the proponents of computer-based information (data) retrieval systems and challenges biologists and other scientists who are prospective designers of such systems to demythologize computers and data banks. The data bank is not a larger-than-life creature of science and technology having vast, McLuhanesque powers to digest information and spew back answers. The myths about the computer lead to unrealistic assumptions and expectations, becoming in time grand delusions and dangerous snares. Four myths are discussed: I. The Myth of the Automatic System, II. The Myth of the User-Oriented System, III. The Myth of Compatibility, and IV. The Myth of the Liberated Scientist. Under the first myth, six specific fallacies about data banking are discussed, concerning personnel requirements, the flexibility of computer media, and the computer's capacity to facilitate the organization, editing, and publication of data. The computer, it is asserted repeatedly, has a greater potential to enslave than to liberate the scientist. It is concluded that computerized systems are not alternatives for conventional systems of storing and retrieving information (data), but merely extensions or enhancements of such systems. Computers will not substitute for people, nor will automation replace the hand of the expert. The author, even while exposing what he terms data-banking myths, tries to make plain his own continuing dedication to the computer revolution in systematics as it pertains to information retrieval, but he stresses that this revolution can go forward only on the basis of realities, not on myths.
10.2307/1218094|Existing descriptions of patterns of stomatal development in monocotyledons are very few, often inaccurate and sometimes misleading. The terminologies developed therefrom are probably not very useful. In this article the situation is clarified with respect to information obtained from the examination of the development of the stomatal complex in about 100 species of monocotyledons representing most families. Certain families lack divisions of cells surrounding the guard cell mother cell (meristemoid). Others possess such divisions which may be categorized as either oblique or non-oblique. Many families lack oblique divisions, others are characterized by oblique divisions. There seems to be a correlation between the presence of oblique divisions and the shortness of the protodermal cells. In some families the sequence of divisions is quite precise, in others it is quite variable. Available evidence shows that there are no major groups of monocotyledonous families characterized by a particular pattern of divisions in the development of the stomatal complex and that speculations about the phylogenetic significance of these patterns are premature. It is suggested that the stomatal complex has value as a systematic character only in combination with a variety of other characters and only by consideration of groups which are already known to be natural. Our present appreciation of the affinities of monocotyledonous groups should be used as a source of comparative information about the development of the stomatal complex in monocotyledons and not vice versa.
10.2307/1218095|Several cases are cited from the literature of misinterpretation of taxonomic relationships, where distantly related species of Quercus exhibit parallelism in leaf form. This paper presents a number of other examples in which species belonging to different subgenera are remarkably similar in gross leaf morphology. In each such example, the two species occur in very similar habitats, and actually co-exist in some areas. It is assumed that their similarities are adaptive, and in two of the more extreme examples speculations are advanced as to what the adaptive significance may be.
10.2307/1218096| In France, several "Socits Linnennes" still enjoy a scientific activity, especially at Bordeaux, Caen and Lyon. Information is given on the membership and the nature of the first "Socit Linnenne de Paris": field meetings around Paris between 1822 and 1827 are reported. The birth of the tradition took place about 1790. The various clubs for french Linnaeans and their correspondents were "branches", "colonies", "socits affilies"; women were admitted since 1822. The publications of the Society dealt with various theoretical and technical sciences. The second Parisian Linnaean Society, created by H. E. Baillon, is also briefly discussed. 
10.2307/1218097|Criteria are given for determination of stems of regularly declined nouns and adjectives in Greek or Latin based on knowledge of the nominative and genitive singular forms. Rules and examples are given for regular derivation of the compounding forms from the stems. Revisions are proposed for Article 73 and Recommendation 73G of the "International Code of Botanical Nomenclature." A section is included on simple composition of botanical names.
10.2307/1218099|Some of the reasons, both sociological and biological, for the taxonomic difficulties found in modern cultivated species are enumerated. The relevance of numerical techniques is discussed, and contrasted with their usage in classical taxonomy. Some new approaches are suggested.
10.2307/1218100|Enquiry into the material available to Linnaeus when publishing the name Mimosa latisiliqua in 1753 shows that he intended this for the jumbie bean widespread in the Bahamas and that the correct name for this species should accordingly be Leucaena latisiliqua (L.) Gillis with Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit as a synonym. Lysiloma sabicu Benth. and L. bahamense Benth. ("Lysiloma latisiliqua" auct.) are then clearly delimited.
10.2307/1218702|In comparison to other theories put forward so far, the Serial Endosymbiosis Theory appears to be the most critically favoured as an explanation for the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts. For this reason some of its implications are drawn attention to. In particular it is shown that present hierarchical concepts and terminology based on the classical cell theory are inadequate to cope with the S.E.T. (as the theory is abbreviated here). It is shown that the topological relations of mitochondria and chloroplasts to the cell suggest that they are topologically "outside" it, "embraced" rather than lying truly within it. This position is consistent with the S.E.T. On the other hand microtubule-organising-centres are truly within the cell. An autogenous origin for the latter seems to be more likely than the endosymbiotic proposal of Margulis. In addition to the primary origin of organelles by the transformation of entire prokaryotic endosymbionts, the possibility of the maintenance of eukaryotic organelles produced by one cell, taken into another, is discussed. Examples of some recently discovered, unusual photosynthetic states in ciliates, brought about by temporary foreign chloroplast maintenance, and possibly degeneration of endosymbiotic photosynthetic flagellates, are discussed in this context. The existence of some contemporary examples of photosynthetic bodies which seem to be intermediate between endosymbiotic blue-green algae and chloroplasts, suggests that some organelles may have had a more recent origin than the Precambrian Era, the process being a continuous one. Some of the difficulties inherent in alternative theories for the origin of eukaryotes are discussed. It is stressed that alternative proposals have not yet received intensive exposition and comparisons with the S.E.T. are thus difficult. Attempts to use single criteria (particularly biochemical) as phylogenetic "markers" should be made with due consideration of the S.E.T. Finally, it has bearing on the recognition of kingdoms, for it widens the already acknowledged chasm between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, intermediates between the two types of organisation being impossible (as stressed by Margulis).
10.2307/1218705|The division of living organisms into Plantae and Animalia fails to recognise the major evolutionary discontinuity between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In addition, fungi and "plant-animal" unicells lie uncomfortably in such a two-kingdom system. Systems have been proposed which separate prokaryotes from eukaryotes and divide the latter into several kingdoms. These schemes share two limitations. The "low" eukaryote kingdom (Protoctista or Protista) contains phyla more closely related to phyla of the "higher" kingdoms than to other phyla in the same kingdom. Secondly, the higher kingdoms are polyphyletic to a disturbing degree. Can one make broad classifications without these limitations? A Prokaryota/Eukaryota two-kingdom scheme is one possibility; another is a four-kingdom scheme in which the protistan level is absorbed into the eukaryote kingdoms; a third possibility is a system in which phylum and phylogeny units stand as monophyletic kingdoms; such a multikingdom scheme provides fruitful scope for discussion. The Prokaryota/Eukaryota and multikingdom schemes allow flexibility for incorporation of new information on relationships, but may be thought too fragmentary for practical taxonomy. If so, various four- or five-kingdom schemes are available.
10.2307/1218706|The method of the "multiple working hypothesis" is best applied to "those subjects in which, while much is known, more remains to be known," a description which certainly is applicable to the Phylogeny of the Protista. Although various proposed phylogenies have been stoutly defended by their authors as unassailable, each has been based on one or another line of evidence, generalization or previous assumption which is contested strongly by others. Previous workers have regarded the Protista as animals or as plants, as one distinct kingdom, or as including representatives of two, three or as many as 13 kingdoms. Classifications and phylogenetic interpretations have been based on various aspects of morphology, cytology, ultrastructure, biochemistry, physiology, life cycles, or the fossil record. Each resulting classification has much supporting evidence but leaves unanswered other vexing problems. The present symposium includes only a sampling of the types of approach currently being used, but may aid in stimulating additional interest and study of the highly diverse and intriguing organisms known as the Protista.
10.2307/1218707|Even though the fossil record is incomplete and perhaps difficult to use in phylogenetic studies of the Protista, in the last resort it is the true basis for any real phylogeny as the dimension of time must be taken into consideration. Other hypothetical phylogenies represent speculation based on analysis of a single time plane. Major algal differentiation was a series of ancient events that took place early in the Precambrian and preceded the diversification of the animal kingdom. Every plant division, five of the classes and seven orders of plants, are represented by fossils of Precambrian age. In addition over 1500 described cyst species of some algal group (= Hystrichophyta or Acritarcha) occur in the Precambrian and Paleozoic, that may eventually fill in some of the gaps in the fossil record of the algae and contribute to a refinement of any future phylogenetic studies. With the increasing cooperation developing today between modern biologists and paleontologists interested in phylogenetic studies, I am optimistic for the future of this interesting and highly speculative field.
10.2307/1218708|We first list the main experimental methods used to get an insight into the phylogenetic relationships of the presently existing bacterial genera. Their scope and relative merits are briefly discussed. As a model system we briefly summarize the application of most of those methods to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships within the genus Agrobacterium. The evolutionary development of this genus is described. Similar experiments with Zymomonas are summarized.
10.2307/1218709|The basis for, and advantages of, the use of sequence analysis of proteins are presented. Cytochrome c is used as an example and it is suggested that not enough work has been done upon the amino acid sequences of proteins of fungi, especially cytochrome c. Other means of studying proteins and enzymes in order to acquire data useful to evolutionists who deal with fungi are discussed, including analysis of mechanisms of control of enzyme activity, electrophoretic migration and properties of enzymes such as response to activators and inhibitors, pH and temperature optima etc. Finally, micromolecules are discussed in the context of their function in the fungi, and suggestions are made as to their present and potential use in phylogenetic studies of these organisms.
10.2307/1218711|Comments are made regarding the impropriety of using non-random data in analytic tests requiring the assumption of randomness. The distinction is made between the biological population and that portion of it for which measurement is desired. A technique is proposed that permits the selection of randomly chosen plants from natural plant populations with less labor than is required by conventional methods. A table is provided of ranked random numbers, for employment by this technique.
10.2307/1218712|The possible sources of error resulting from the use of phenolic spot patterns in chemosystematic studies are discussed. It is argued that identification of compounds eliminates the need for making assumptions which may be erroneous. Examples are provided to demonstrate that identification of phenolics provides the basis for more meaningful interpretations of the chemical data. Two procedures are presented for carrying out studies in which the structures of the compounds may be determined. Chemical information must not be given undue weight when used in systematic studies. It is usually of greatest value when combined with other data.
10.2307/1218714|The disjunction of the genus Larrea between the arid regions of North and South America is well known and much discussed in the phytogeographical literature. Not so well known are the North American--South American disjunctions in Fagonia and Porlieria, the New World--Old World disjunctions in Fagonia and Peganum, and Bulnesia's disjunction within South America. Each genus, its close relatives in the family, and possible explanations for its present distribution are discussed.
10.2307/1218715|A collection of Paleogene plants reputed to contain distichous short shoots of Taxodium and Metasequoia (Taxodiaceae) has been studied. The evidence to support this view is weak and it appears that if a genus of the Taxodiaceae is involved, Sequoia is the most likely. A number of other gymnospermous genera, both within and without the Taxodiaceae, could have produced these shoots but there is no clear evidence to decide which one of them. These plants are referred to Elatocladus Halle, a form genus for sterile coniferous and taxad shoots.
10.2307/1218718|The concept of cultivar is essentially different from the concept of any botanical taxon and therefore no cultivar can ever be co-extensive with the botanical taxon in which it occurs. Retroactive application of both Codes requires the repudiation of all past attempts to treat cultivar names within the botanical system. Cultivars they were, are, and always have been, so such combinations are botanically absurd and invalid. Conversely, the use of infra-specific botanical epithets as cultivar names is equally objectionable.
10.2307/1218719|Specimens of vascular plants designated as types by Thomas H. Kearney, Jr. during 1890 to 1901 have been inaccessible and considered destroyed since the third decade of the twentieth century. These specimens have been found to be extant in the New York Botanical Garden Herbarium, the Ohio State Herbarium, and the United States National Herbarium. The majority of these types are at the Ohio State University which houses T. H. Kearney's original collection of several thousand specimens. The collection is also rich in types which Kearney received from W. W. Ashe, A. W. Chapman, F. V. Coville, A. Gattinger, E. L. Greene, A. A. Heller, F. Lamson-Scribner, C. Mohr, G. V. Nash, C. L. Pollard, A. Ruth, J. K. Small, and other contemporary botanists. The collection at the Ohio State University probably contains additional types which are as yet unverified. This paper catalogues the known type specimens of T. H. Kearney, Jr.
10.2307/1218721|Constantine Samuel Rafinesque (1783-1840) is undoubtedly the most discussed North American naturalist. His Bibliotheca now numbers at least 370 entries, of which 127 are here indexed for the first time. These 127 entries complement the already 134 titles published by Fitzpatrick in 1911 and the 109 titles listed by Merrill in 1949.
10.2307/1218723|The "Kew Record of Taxonomic Literature" is intended to fulfil the need for a unified, comprehensive coverage of the world's taxonomic literature. It is to be an annual publication listing all articles, books and papers relating to the taxonomy of vascular plants, and will include all new names at every rank with the exception of cultivars. All papers relevant to the taxonomy, in a broad sense, of flowering plants, gymnosperms and ferns have been included, but those in related fields such as pure genetics, cytology and physiology have usually been omitted. Entries are arranged, wherever possible, in systematic groups, with more general papers contained in sections on nomenclature, chromosome surveys, chemotaxonomy, anatomy and morphology, palynology, embryology and reproductive biology. Sections are also included on bibliography, personalia, and botanical institutions, and there is a large section on floristics.
10.2307/1218750|Bobartia Ker-Gawler (1827) has been conserved against Bobartia L. (1753) -- entry 1284 in the Code. It is shown that this conservation is superfluous and should be discontinued. Bobartia L. is a South African genus of Iridaceae. The type species is B. indica, which is typified by a specimen in the Hermann herbarium (now at BM) believed by Linnaeus to have come from Ceylon.
10.2307/1218767|The phylogeny of eucaryotic algae can be best illustrated by establishing lines of algal evolution leading from simple unicells to an elaborated tissue thallus. These evolutionary lines of algal morphological progress represent the Classes. The single grades of algal advance in a class represent a lower taxonomic rank, the Order, which is thus defined morphologically by the level of plant body construction. It represents a particular degree of morphological differentiation and a step in the phylogenetic progress. One or more parallel evolutionary lines may occur within the highest rank of taxa, the Division. Apart from the procaryotic Cyanophyceae, nine classes evolved in parallel within the plants called algae: 1. Chlorophyceae (the ancestors of higher land plants), 2. Conjugatophyceae, 3. Charophyceae, 4. Chrysophyceae, 5. Xanthophyceae, 6. Bacillariophyceae, 7. Phaeophyceae, 8. Dinophyceae, 9. Rhodophyceae. Flagellates that cannot be placed with respect to their morphology and structure in monadoid orders of algal classes, are excluded from the system and termed "residual flagellates": Euglenales, Cryptomonadales, Vacuolariales, Dictyochales and other orders of colorless flagellates.
10.2307/1218769| The affinities of the phylum Charophyta and the general evolutionary trends undergone by this group since the Late Silurian are discussed briefly. The main emphasis is placed on the Mesozoic family Clavatoraceae as the rapid changes in the utricle, a supplementary envelope investing the female gametangium, have led to quite diversified and elaborate structures that allow more detailed phylogenetic studies. Three lineages are analysed which, throughout the Lower Cretaceous, show a sequence of gradual changes linking quite distinct extreme types. These lineages concern respectively the genus Globator, the genera Perimneste and Atopochara, and the genera Flabellochara and Clypeator, for each of which new data are presented. The relationships between the three subfamilies and the several genera of the Clavatoraceae are discussed, as well as the mode of extinction of the group at the end of the Cretaceous and the rates of taxonomic evolution in the studied lineages. A biochronological zonation is established for the Lower Cretaceous on the basis of the three described evolutionary sequences. The zonation, with nine biozones from the Berriasian to the Cenomanian, seems to be useful in correlating non-marine formations on a worldwide scale. /// [French] Les affinits du phylum des Charophytes et les tendances volutives gnrales prsentes par le groupe depuis le Silurien terminal sont brivement discutes. La famille msozoque des Clavatoraceae est plus spcialement tudie. Chez celles-ci en effet les changements rapides prsents par l'utricule, enveloppe supplmentaire entourant le gamtange femelle, ont conduit  la ralisation de structures trs diversifies et complexes qui permettent des tudes phylogntiques plus dtailles. Trois sries sont analyses qui montrent, au cours du Crtac infrieur, une suite de changements progressifs unissant des types extrmes trs distincts. Ces sries concernent respectivement le genre Globator, les genres Perimneste et Atopochara, et les genres Flabellochara et Clypeator; pour chacune des rsultats nouveaux sont donns. Les relations entre les trois sous-familles et les divers genres de Clavatoraceae sont discutes ainsi que les modalits de l'extinction du groupe  la fin du Crtac et les taux d'volution taxonomique dans les sries tudies. Sur la base de ces trois sries une zonation biochronologique est introduite pour le Crtac infrieur continental. Cette zonation, avec neuf biozones du Berriasien au Cnomanien, semble utilisable pour des corrlations  l'chelle du globe. 
10.2307/1218771| Sarcodinid taxonomy was previously revised by Jahn and Bovee (1965) on the basis of the two readily distinguishable methods of ameboid locomotion, respectively the contractile-hydraulic and the active sliding systems. Pseudopodial form and structure were regarded as characters of ordinal rank. The present general summary of the classification and the status of further investigations, continues the reclassification to the family level, citing authors and dates, as well as presenting brief definitions of sub-classes, orders (and superorders and suborders where applicable), families and sub-families. New taxa proposed include the families Striamoebidae and Discamoebidae, both of Bovee and Jahn, and their type genera, Striamoeba and Discamoeba of Bovee, and Pentagonina Bovee and Jahn (nom. nov. pro Pentagonia Gauthier-Livre and Thomas, 1958 non Cozzens, 1846). The tentative phylogenetic scheme proposed by Bovee and Jahn in agreement with the symbiotic theory of eukaryotic origins is briefly outlined. 
10.2307/1218772|Studies on the evolution and phylogeny of various groups of the Protozoa, a major taxon or portion of the eukaryotic kingdom Protista, have been proceeding apace, particularly in recent years, although they appear to have attracted little attention to date among students of evolutionary biology in general. In searching for the reasons for this apparent fact the "shortcomings" of the protozoa themselves, as objects of phylogenetic investigation, may be held responsible. Such difficulties are discussed under six broad headings: the very nature of the Protozoa (microscopic size, unicellularity, common absence of sexuality, ubiquity), the frequent lack of fossil material, the paucity of described species, the scarcity of morphological features, the even greater rareness of non-morphological characteristics usable in comparative study, and the unevenness in both our specific and general knowledge of these microorganisms. At the same time, new approaches and recent research in progress mitigate the awesomeness of these challenges to a degree which should allow us to recognize that such work is not being carried out entirely in vain. Many examples, often from the ciliate literature, are cited in illustration of points made. If protozoologists interested in phylogenetic problems can more successfully avoid the pitfalls inherent in their research, apply approaches broader in nature yet technically as sophisticated as possible, take into account constructive criticism, whether from insiders or outsiders, and learn from the experiences of other evolutionary biologists, they and their works will then be predictably deserving of considerably wider respect and recognition than apparently they are presently accorded.
10.2307/1218773|Variation was measured in samples of populations of species from four plant families including tropical, temperate and cosmopolitan taxa. Populations of species of Asclepiadaceae, Bromeliaceae, Leguminosae and Umbelliferae were sampled. Employing a simple application of numerical phenetics and tested character lists, estimates of within-group overall variation were made. The coefficients of phenetic variation (CPV) are compared among the various groups. The groups considered are populations as well as taxa at several levels in the classification hierarchy, although in all cases, individuals sampled randomly from putative populations are the operational taxonomic units (OTUs). A small number of individuals is employed with a large number of characters. This application of numerical phenetics serves both alpha taxonomic and biosystematic goals and an OTU x OTU matrix of distance values is the basis for obtaining estimates of a population's variability. The phenetic distances between OTUs are the variates. Distinct trends of within-group variation are consistent as they were revealed in the four families. Intrapopulational coefficient of phenetic variation for populations of the tropical family Bromeliaceae is estimated as nearly double that for the other three families. The intraspecific variation as portrayed by CPV in the Asclepiadaceae and Leguminosae is about half that for the tropical family, Bromeliaceae. As sampled a clear distinction is evidenced in the change in variation between various taxonomic ranks for the families. The difference in CPV between the intrapopulational and intraspecific levels for the Leguminosae and Bromeliaceae is nearly double the difference between these two ranks for the Asclepiadaceae. Results show that the method has descriptive and heuristic value for systematics.
10.2307/1218774|The discovery of betalains and specific P-type sieve-tube plastids in Halophytum, a genus which has been treated as both a member of Chenopodiaceae as well as a distinct family, confirms the alignment of the genus with the nine betalain-containing families of the Centrospermae all of which have characteristic P-type sieve-tube plastids.
10.2307/1218776|The discovery of betalains and P-type sieve-tube plastids in Petiveria and Agdestis (Phytolaccaceae) supports the assignment of these genera to the Centrospermae.
10.2307/1218777|The date of Fournier's "Mexicanas plantas", pars II (Gramineae) is discussed. From a review of the available facts and in view of the stability of nomenclature, the 1886 date should be maintained.
10.2307/1218779|There are two steps to the latinization of personal names: adding -i- to the stem of most names ending in consonants (stem augmentation) and determining the appropriate case ending to be added (inflection). A review of Roman personal nomenclature shows that Romans formed surnames from given names by stem augmentation (adding -i-) before inflection. Latinization of modern names with stem augmentation honors a person by according his name the same treatment originally accorded only to the surnames of patrician and noble Romans. Consideration is given to use of personal names in forming adjectival and substantive epithets and determining the appropriate inflections. A review is made of irregularities of stem modification used by botanists in latinizing personal names, particularly those ending in vowels. Proposals are made for revising Article 73 and Recommendation 73C to give a better organization, to clarify the separate procedures of stem augmentation and inflection, and to remove the example, Verbena hasslerana, which is contrary to botanical usage.
10.2307/1218781|Consideration is given to the several possible ways of treating the names of perfect states placed in imperfect state genera when original descriptions included either both states or the perfect state alone. A proposal is presented to cover this situation by the addition of a further paragraph and examples to Art. 59. The need for some clarification of Articles 34 and 72 in relation to their bearings on Art. 59 are pointed out and two proposals made to resolve existing anomalies.
10.2307/1218783|In this contribution Avena sativa L., A. fatua L., A. nuda L. and A. sterilis L. are typified. The first and last retain their current meaning; A. fatua L. is the correct name for A. septentrionalis Malz. and A. nuda L. is the correct name for A. nudibrevis Vavilov.
10.2307/1218785|The large-flowered species L. nanus and L. vallicola, and the small-flowered L bicolor of Dunn's classification are fully interfertile. The large-flowered species L. spectabilis and L. affinis are reproductively isolated from the rest of the group, but some sterile hybrids can be obtained between these two species and L. nanus. The small-flowered species L. polycarpus and L. pachylobus are completely reproductively isolated. In the hybridizations attempted, the pollen of one species can not germinate on the stigma of the other species of the group. In the light of the results of the hybridization experiments the two subspecies of L. vallicola were placed in the species L. nanus.
10.2307/1218786|All valid names in Cortaderia Stapf (nom. cons.) are typified and recent treatments of the genus are substantially upheld. Taxa in Section Cortaderia are more precisely defined with no major nomenclatural changes except that C. jubata (Lem.) Stapf is regarded as the valid name for plants formerly known as "C. quila (Nees) Stapf". In Section Bifida, C. aristata and C. trianae are regarded as synonyms of C. bifida, and C. sodiroana as synonymous with C. nitida; C. minima is regarded as a synonym of C. pilosa. The new combination C. archboldii (Hitchcock) Connor and Edgar is based on Danthonia archboldii from New Guinea. The genus is gynodioecious though in some species of Section Cortaderia only female plants are found.
10.2307/1218787| A short review of the preparation by the publisher Paul Klincksieck (Paris) and French botanists such as Malinvaud of the basic French flora of the early 20th century, the Flore of the abb Coste. The genesis of the first parts of the flora is described on the basis of letters from Coste, Flahault, Klincksieck and Malinvaud. Some subsequent uses of Coste's illustrations and some other projects of the publisher are discussed. /// [French] La Flore de Coste, termine en 1906, demeure un ouvrage de base en botanique franaise et europenne. A l'origine de cette ralisation, un diteur: Paul Klincksieck, et l'avis d'Ernest Malinvaud, mais aussi le travail efficace d'un botaniste isol: le Chanoine Coste. En outre, l'attachement de Klincksieck au "modle" amricain publi par Britton et Brown fut dterminant. Les projets qui firent suite  la Flore de Coste sont galement rappels. 
10.2307/1218807|A proposal is made to recognize super ranks, including the new rank of dominion (Dominium) above that of the kingdom (Regnum), and to designate suffixes for those of superfamily and above.
10.2307/1218809|Family names with vernacular terminations are discussed, especially as they relate to fungi, and changes in Art. 18, Note 2 and Art. 19, Note 2 and two new notes are proposed.
10.2307/1218811|Weresub, Malloch and Pirozynski's proposal to delete the existing third paragraph of Article 59 to make it more in accord with other parts of the Code is considered. It is concluded that this would not be in the best interests of the stability of nomenclature in the fungi and consequently recommended that it be rejected by the next International Botanical Congress.
10.2307/1218817|The expression emendatio is used in different senses in algal taxonomy. Some examples are analysed. The expression emendatio is used in connection with authors cited after the Latin name in two cases: (i) when completing the diagnosis ("inclusive typo"), or (ii) upon a misinterpretation of nomenclatural types. The citation of both cases is well provided for in other Articles of the Code and the use of the expression emendatio is therefore superfluous. In connection with this proposals are made to change some Recommendations of the Code.
10.2307/1218426|Apomixis is not necessary. Neither agamospermy, nor its common companion polyploidy, confer selective advantages on populations that are not equally well provided for in the diploid sexual breeding system. Yet, gametophytic apomixis is widely distributed among diverse families of flowering plants, and agamospecies are frequently as widely distributed as their most successful sexual relatives. The principal adaptive advantage of apomixis is that it can restore fertility in sexually sterile individuals. Polyploidy enhances interspecific hybridization, and it is among such hybrid complexes where apomixis is commonly encountered. Once established, apomixis contributes toward immediate fitness by fixing and reproducing advantageous genotypes. Continuous progressive evolution, however, depends on an essential equilibrium between sexual and asexual reproduction.
10.2307/1218428|The problem of representing within-OTU character variability in numerical taxonomy is considered and the limitations inherent in the restriction to single values, for example means or more seriously exemplar individuals, are emphasised. Jardine and Sibson's distinction between the attributes of individuals and the characters of populations or taxa is considered a useful one in its emphasis on the different treatment required for the comparison of individuals as OTUs as against that of groups. Existing methods of handling character variation are outlined and their limitations discussed. A new method, the character-state frequency procedure, which can readily be incorporated into existing programs, is described and its effects on the analysis of two sets of data are outlined.
10.2307/1218430|Edge-punched cards were used in a simple method to detect phenetic relationships among the 27 species of Solanum section Brevantherum. Data from species descriptions were placed on two sets of punch cards, one for measuring the character correlations among species, the other for detecting modal character states of the group and helping with key construction. A matrix of phenetic similarity was compiled by sorting the deck of character cards and comparing each species with every other to determine the number of character states shared by species pairs. Simple analyses were performed which are expressed graphically. Phenetic distance of each species from a hypothetical ancestor is illustrated. Punch card methods have the advantage of allowing constant contact with actual character states during the study.
10.2307/1218432|An analysis of the different taxa -- orders, families, genera and species indicates that some concept of the latter three must have been formulated by man from the very early times where plants were first being domesticated. However, the generic concept seems to be the earliest and most basic. In the process of domestication the primitive man apparently picked plants on the basis of their features without discrimination as to species. Except in the case of monotypic genera or single species isolated from the main generic range, hybridization among species has played from the very beginning an important role in the origin of cultivation. As a result, in most cultigens, no single ancestral species would be traceable in later times and also it would be impossible to trace the origin of most of these plants to a single precise geographical center.
10.2307/1218433|Attention is drawn to the unsatisfactory nature of the suprageneric classification of the family Portulacaceae adopted in the Pflanzenfamilien. A new arrangement is proposed in which seven tribes only are recognised; two of these, the Calyptrotheceae and the Calyptrideae, are new.
10.2307/1218434|Outcrossing rates in natural populations of Lupinus nanus Dougl. have been found to vary from nearly zero to nearly 100 percent (Harding and Horovitz, 1969; Harding, 1970). These studies were based primarily on a group of northern populations of subspecies apricus (Elliott, Harding, and Mankinen; paper VI). The purposes of this paper are (1) to report estimates of outcrossing for the other subspecies of L. nanus, (2) to report estimates of outcrossing for the closely related species, L. bicolor, L. affinis, L. polycarpus, and L. pachylobus, (3) to discuss the relationship between these estimates of outcrossing and autofertility, and (4) to discuss the relationship between outcrossing and phenotypic and genotypic variability maintained in populations.
10.2307/1218449| In the application of Art. 23 and 32 no valid publication can be found in Secretan's 'Mycographie Suisse' (1833). The total outlawing of the 591 usually forgotten new names of this work is highly satisfactory for nomenclatural stability. Some comments and proposals for modification of the code are expressed on the problem of publication by reference and incidental mention. /// [French] En application des Art. 23 et 32 aucune publication valide ne peut tre trouve dans la Mycographie Suisse de Secretan (1833). L'exclusion totale des 591 nouveaux noms de cet ouvrage, qui taient gnralement oublis, est trs satisfaisante pour la stabilit de la nomenclature. Quelques commentaires et propositions de modification du code sont exprims sur le problme de la publication par rfrence et la mention incidente. 
10.2307/1218450|An analysis is made of the use of i, j, u, and v respectively as vowels, semivowels and fricative consonants. It is concluded that there are three problems: first, the present paragraph 5 of Article 73 is not being applied and its deletion is proposed; second, the only major problem is the early use of v as a pure vowel and a proposal to correct this is made; third, there is no provision in the Code for choosing between alternative orthographies in an original publication and a proposal is made covering this with reference to the letters i vs. j and u vs. v.
10.2307/1218451|Changes in the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature approved at the Seattle (1969) Congress affecting autonyms (automatically established names) are considered to have been retrograde steps. Proposals are made to reverse these decisions, thus again allowing autonyms to be considered for purposes of priority, and requiring autonyms to be used for all names of taxa at infraspecific, infrageneric and infrafamilial rank which include the type of the correct name of the next higher taxon (except for subsections and lower infrageneric ranks previously already excluded from this requirement). A proposal is also made that the word 'autonym' should be more clearly defined.
10.2307/1218452|The failure of the Seattle Congress to clarify Article 35 of the International Code is discussed and a modified proposal is resubmitted for consideration at the Leningrad Congress. Two other proposals concerning Article 35 are also made.
10.2307/1218989|The various techniques of electron microscopy have contributed valuable information to systematics in general and have, in many instances, been instrumental in solving taxonomic problems which had arisen from the limitations of earlier, comparative morphological studies. This paper presents evidence for the general significance of electron-microscopic data in plant systematics. Specific applications of thin-sectioning (TEM), freeze-etching (FE) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to the taxonomy of plant groups, and corresponding publications are tabulated. A more extensive analysis of applications of ultrastructure to conventional and experimental classifications of prokaryotes, fungi, eukaryotic algae, lichens, bryophytes, ferns and seed plants will be presented in a future communication.
10.2307/1218992|Evolutionary proposals involving pollen grain characters have treated germinal apertures as though they were formed by one universal process and hence derivable from a common type. A review of published data on apertural formation for pollen of Silene, Tradescantia, and Nelumbo and original information for Epilobium indicates that there are several possibly distinct apertural induction processes. It would seem to be an oversimplification and perhaps misleading to ignore apertural genesis in interpretations involving relationships between taxa.
10.2307/1218995|Using the technique of carbon isotopic ratio determinations, 20 selected species of Euphorbia (s. lat.) have been investigated to determine their metabolic status. Previous work is reviewed, and as found by previous investigators, enriched
10.2307/1218997|The outcome of random cross-pollination and incomplete self-pollination in populations of two cytotypes not capable of hybridizing is analyzed in a simple model. The reproductive success of a cytotype is frequency-dependent, the minority being at a disadvantage because it suffers a greater proportion of ineffectual pollinations. The reproductive handicap in a given generation leads to a greater handicap in the next, the minority cytotype being rapidly excluded from the population. Self-pollination reduces the minority disadvantage and the tempo of the exclusion process as does the immigration of minority type pollen and seeds. It is concluded that unless two cytotypes have disparate ecological requirements, a minority disadvantage will cause the local extinction of one of the cytotypes, even though they may be equally fit in all respects.
10.2307/1218998|The modern biological species-concept, defined by genetic isolation, describes a phyletically independent system of populations. Most of the species-concepts in everyday use for the oaks (Quercus) exhibit genetic interchange with other so-called species. Nevertheless, these classical concepts remain in use and represent biologically meaningful populations. In addition, it is suggested that the classical species of Quercus may represent phyletic units in species-grade evolutionary advances. A comparison between the biological species-concept and the classical species-concept in Quercus suggests why the classical concepts have been retained. The biological species-concept appears to be a population system of extraordinary complexity and difficult to delimit in Quercus. This genetically isolated complex population system is not directly comparable to genetically discrete species in most other genera. The prime function of the species binomial is as a unit of communication. The biological species-concept must be used with greater flexibility as regards taxonomic rank if its designation by means of a binomial cannot provide a functional information retrieval system.
10.2307/1219001| This is a discussion of the South American grasslands from the standpoint of their evolution and composition. The tribes are considered in relation to climate, and grasses are classified as mega-, meso-, or microthermic with respect to their temperature requirements. The principal grassland regions are three: (A) Tropical and Subtropical, which include the Llanos of the Orinoco River system and the Campos Cerrados of Central Brazil; (B) Temperate, including the Pampa of Argentina and the Campos of Uruguay; and (C) Cold Country Grasslands, which are the Steppes of the high Andes and Patagonia, and also the Pramos of Colombia and Ecuador. Some attention is given to the floristic composition of each of these regions. The subject of endemism is dealt with, as well as the problem of disjunct distribution. Included is a discussion of changes brought about by agriculture and ranching in historic times, and what may be expected in the future. 
10.2307/1219002| Grassland covers no less than 10-12% of the territory of Mexico. Its main types are briefly described and grouped according to their ecological determinism as climatic, edaphic, and anthropogenic. Ecological affinities of Mexican grasslands in relation to those of other parts of America are discussed, and 5 different communities dominated by grasses are analyzed as to the total geographical distribution of their genera and species, utilizing floristic lists available in the literature. The grassland characteristic of the semiarid areas of the High Plateau shows a high percentage of endemic species and genera. Its flora is similar to that of xerophilous scrubs of Mexico and has relatively little in common with the flora of the United States, in spite of the fact that ecologically this plant community is similar to the "short-grass prairie" of western North America. The alpine grassland is also rich in species which are restricted to Mexico, but the analysis does not show any genus of limited area. On the other hand neotropical and holarctic influences in the flora are more or less even, although by its ecology and physiognomy the community is analogous to some "pramos" of the South American Andes. The savannas, or warm and humid climate grasslands, have few endemics in Mexico, and their floristic and ecological affinities are directed evidently to the south. The inland variant of the halophilous grassland shows moderate abundance of elements of restricted distribution, and the neotropical influence prevails slightly in its flora over the holarctic. The gypsophilous grassland, which does not seem to exist in America outside northern Mexico and adjacent areas of the United States, is rich in endemic genera and species, many of the last being obligate gypsophytes of very limited distribution. There is no direct evidence regarding the origin and the age of Mexican grasslands, but on the basis of data obtained from the analysis made, from the distribution of several grasses important in these grasslands, as well as from some paleogeographical and paleozoological data, it can be speculated that the existence of grasslands in Mexico may date from the middle or even from the early Tertiary. It is postulated that semiarid grasslands of this country, as well as the gypsophilous ones, had an "autochthonous" origin and a long evolutionary history. It is also possible that Mexico played an important role in the evolution of the halophilous grasslands of America. In contrast, the alpine ones seem to have a relatively recent origin, and the savannas possibly originated and evolved mainly in other sections of tropical America. 
10.2307/1219003|This discussion deals primarily with the European secondary grassland, especially meadows and pastures. The principal constituents of this vegetation are about 20 species. Particular attention is paid to its evolution under the influence of man. In addition to the natives (members of natural vegetation cover) there are several species or races which are restricted to man-made habitats. It is suggested that these latter are not native to the area of present distribution, but have immigrated under differentiation from abroad (the minor part) or evolved in situ (the major part). The significance of hybridization and introgression is stressed. It is contended that grassland evolution is still in progress, an important factor being the close interaction between cultivated grasses and their wild relatives in extra-Mediterranean Europe, the center of diversity and origin of meadow and pasture grasses.
10.2307/1219004|The evolutionary history of the grass flora of the Great Plains of North America is interpreted on the basis of the probable origin and development of eight different polyploid complexes that include common species of this flora. The related complexes of Bouteloua and Buchloe have their centers of distribution in the southwestern United States and particularly northern and central Mexico, so probably entered the Great Plains from the southwest. The genus Bouteloua has the distribution pattern of a relatively youthful complex, while Buchloe and related genera, which are mostly polyploid and are separated from each other by distinct morphological gaps, show signs of greater maturity. The complexes of Andropogon sects. Schizachyrium and Arthrolophis, as well as the genus Sorghastrum and sect. Virgata of Panicum, all have similar distribution patterns. Diploids related to the polyploids of the Great Plains exist, for the most part, either along the Gulf Coast of the southeastern United States or in more mesic regions of tropical America. These polyploids either originated in situ or entered the Great Plains from the southeast. In the tribe Stipeae, the species of Piptochaetium which are abundantly represented by fossil fruits of Pliocene age now survive only in peripheral woodlands to the eastward and mountains to the southwestward, and in the pampas of South America. They have been replaced on the North American plains by Stipa species that entered from Asia and from the mountains to the westward. A final element of the modern grasslands, consists of species assigned to the genera Agropyron and Hordeum. The species of the Great Plains probably entered that region from the western Cordillera during either late Pliocene or early Pleistocene times. These drastic changes in the grass flora of the Great Plains were brought about by equally drastic alterations in climate, edaphic conditions, and fauna of grazing herbivores that took place during the Pleistocene epoch.
10.2307/1219005|The various subdivisions of the genus Ipomoea have been created largely without regard for rules of nomenclature and priority. This complex genus has been divided into an unusually large number of species groups which have been given formal names at several levels. The groups are assimilated and discussed.
10.2307/1219007|Picris echioides L., P. hieracioides L., P. pyrenaica L. and P. asplenioides L. are typified. The first and second retain their current meaning, although P. echioides L. should be placed in the genus Helminthotheca Zinn. P. pyrenaica L. has to be excluded from the genus Picris L.; the name P. asplenioides is for the first time fully clarified.
10.2307/1219009|A lectotype is chosen for Bignonia crucigera L. which proves to be synonymous with Pithecoctenium echinatum (Jacq.) Baill. The new combination Pithecoctenium crucigerum (L.) A. Gentry is proposed for this wellknown neotropical species.
10.2307/1219010|The type species of two Iridaceous genera, Moraea and Dietes are currently known by incorrectly applied epithets. The early nomenclatural history of these two species, Moraea vegeta L. (= M. tristis (L.f.) Ker = M. juncea L. sensu N. E. Br.) and Dietes iridioides (L.) Klatt (= D. vegata (L.) N. E. Br.) is examined and the restoration of the correct epithets proposed. A third species M. juncea L. is rejected as it is not possible to identify this plant.
10.2307/1219011|National herbaria have been defined recently on the basis of what is known about herbaria in the northern hemisphere, and strong emphasis is placed on their size. Little or no importance has been given to herbaria located in other parts of the world. Updated information on Latin American National Herbaria is given in this paper, and an outline of their many important functions is included. A new definition of "national herbarium" is proposed to include these and similar institutions around the world.
10.2307/1219046|An account is given of the obligatory dates in the Rules of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. A list indicating which dates pertain to the main taxonomic groups is added.
10.2307/1219048|The Subcommittee for Family Names recommends adoption of Proposal no. 53 and referral of Proposal no. 18 to a panel of linguistic experts; on the other hand, it does not recommend the adoption of the following proposals: without no. (Paclt), 16-17, 39-40.
10.2307/1219049|The failure of paleobotanists to appreciate parallelism and character-variation in their materials underlies the present confusion and instability of paleobotanical classification and nomenclature. On the other hand, application of the Code in its present form does not bring about stability either, and rewording of part of Art. 3 is proposed.
10.2307/1218333|The technique of somatic cell hybridization or the fusion of protoplasts of different plant species has reached the stage that it may be exploited by systematists for experimentally interpreting phylogenetic relationships of highly divergent lineages. The value of this technique is discussed in relation to others currently employed, and in relation to what we might expect to find at the levels of proteins, secondary products, and morphology based upon our knowledge of plant hybrids and animal hybrid cell cultures.
10.2307/1218335|The chromosomes of sixteen species of nine genera of Lauraceae were studied morphologically at interphase, prophase and metaphase. The chromosomes of Cassytha filiformis were found to show different morphological characteristics in comparison with the other fifteen species, although the basic number of its chromosomes was the same, i. e., x = 12. The karyomorphological evidence in these species coincides with the proposal of Melchior (1964) to divide the Lauraceae into two subfamilies, Lauroideae and Cassythoideae.
10.2307/1218336|A number of recent publications have erroneously stated that the Orchidaceae are characterized by stomata that lack subsidiary cells. The situation is clarified in this article by information obtained from the study of development of the stomatal complex in Ludisia discolor and Spiranthes sp., representatives of the subfamily Neottioideae of the Orchidaceae, as well as by studies of mature stomata of five additional genera of the Neottioideae. These developmental studies document the presence of mesoperigenous subsidiary cells in the Neottioideae and also substantiate the presence of mesoperigenous subsidiary cells in at least one group of the monocotyledons.
10.2307/1218339|Other than the insectivorous nature of the three families, there is little evidence supporting an alliance between the Sarraceniaceae, Droseraceae, and Nepenthaceae. Floral morphology and embryology indicate a relationship between the Sarraceniaceae and the Theales. The Sarraceniaceae are best placed as a suborder in the Theales.
10.2307/1218340|The principles of botanical nomenclature proposed by Thouars in his works on orchids are reviewed. Throughout these works Thouars rather consistently coined names according to his own principles, as alternatives to names in accordance with traditional nomenclature. The alternative specific names were used as binary combinations and can be accepted under the present rules of botanical nomenclature. For this reason they must be taken into consideration in cases where the traditionally formed names have earlier homonyms. It is shown that O. Kuntze's interpretation of Thouars' nomenclature is erroneous. For the single species of Thouars' own genus Corymborkis only one binary combination, Corymborkis corymbis, was used and this has to be accepted as the correct name.
10.2307/1218341| Labillardire visited Australia in 1792 when he collected many botanical specimens at "capite van-Dieman" (Tasmania) and at "Baie Le Grand" (Esperance Bay) in "terra van-Leuwin" (Western Australia). In 1804, Labillardire published the first part of "Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen", which contains descriptions of some of the plants that he collected in New Holland (Australia). While studying Labillardire's original description of Adenanthos obovata, it was noted that the type location was inconsistent with the present distribution pattern of that species. An examination of the areas of distribution of all the species labelled "terra van-Leuwin" showed that some specimens could not have been collected in Western Australia. In other cases the species could be shown to have been collected in localities in Western Australia that Labillardire did not visit, and therefore must have been collected by other botanists. Thus the type locations, indicated by Labillardire, for a group of species are incorrect. An attempt has been made to correct these anomalies, and to suggest the probable collectors. 
10.2307/1218342|Thirty-nine of the forty-three species of Bignoniaceae treated by Vellozo are identified, nine of them for the first time. Four new combinations - Arrabidaea elegans (Vell.) A. Gentry, Pleonotoma fluminensis (Vell.) A. Gentry, Cuspidaria convoluta (Vell.) A. Gentry, and Parabignonia unguiculata (Vell.) A. Gentry - are proposed. A number of existing but rarely used combinations based on Vellozo names which must be adopted are also pointed out as are several commonly used but erroneous Vellozo-based combinations.
10.2307/1218343|The genus Xanthosoma has been arbitrarily lectotypified on X. jacquinii Schott, an illegitimate name. Xanthosoma jacquinii Schott may be considered either as validly published in 1832 (an illegitimate renaming of Arum xanthorrhizon and a synonym of X. sagittifolium (L.) Schott), or as not validly published until 1856 (an illegitimate later homonym of X. jacquinii Schott ex Kunth (1841) and a synonym of X. undipes (Koch) Koch. In view of the arbitrary designation of X. jacquinii as "type species" and the confusion surrounding application of the binomial, it is proposed that X. sagittifolium (L.) Schott be accepted as the lectotype species.
10.2307/1218345| A study of the original publication of Schizomitrium B.S.G. together with materials concerning the three species cited therein clarifies its identity. Lectotypification of Schizomitrium (1851) causes Callicostella (C. Mll.) Mitt. (1859) to fall into synonymy. 
10.2307/1218346|In all treatments of western North American taxa of Aster subsequent to Greene's description of Aster adsurgens in Pittonia 4: 216-217, 1900, this species was placed in the section Multiflori as a close ally to or a synonym of A. commutatus (T. & G.) A. Gray (= A. falcatus commutatus). Examination of the type material reveals that the name does not apply to a taxon of the section Multiflori at all, and a comparison with the corresponding type specimen (Drummond 580, K!) clearly places A. adsurgens in synonymy under A. ascendens Lindley in Hooker (1834).
10.2307/1218347|The evidence for the combination of the rutaceous genera Zanthoxylum and Fagara is presented and the new combinations are proposed.
10.2307/1219491|The historical reasons for the failure to abandon the category Psilophyta until long after it had become a catchall group for unrelated taxa are reviewed. Recent advances in the understanding of the major types of early land plants are summarized in order to test the usefulness of the three Subdivisions of Tracheophyta that were proposed by Banks in 1968; Rhyniophytina, Zosterophyllophytina, Trimerophytina.
10.2307/1219493|Extensive variation was observed for alkaloids in Lupinus nanus. Of the nine alkaloids studied, one was always present, one was nearly always present, one was nearly always absent, and the occurrence of the remaining six was extremely variable. There was little divergence between four geographic subspecies. All populations exhibited polymorphisms for at least two alkaloids. The average number of polymorphisms per population was approximately 4.5 or 50 percent of alkaloids studied. The highest number was found in L. nanus ssp latifolius and the smallest number in L. nanus ssp apricus. The high frequency of some alkaloids suggests natural selection. Alkaloid number 9 was found in all plants throughout all populations of the four subspecies examined. Methods for measuring divergence of populations from subspecies profiles in terms of alkaloid frequencies were developed. Estimates indicated that marginal populations often diverged more from subspecies profiles than did central populations. Methods for measuring population variance were developed and estimates often indicated that central populations were more variable than marginal populations. But these generalizations were not without exception.
10.2307/1219494|Measurements of 38 characters on 760 specimens of L. incisum were subjected to four statistical programs: NUTAL, which gives frequency distributions; GOCOR, which computes Pearson product-moment correlations; FACTOR, which clusters characters; HYBEX, which gives a numerical value to each specimen. The morphological analysis indicates that the pattern of diversity can be interpreted as an early stage in divergence within this species. This is coupled with geographical and environmental correlation with the morphology of the specimens.
10.2307/1219497|The same combination may be given independently by different authors three ways. A later homonym is the same combination given to two different types, or, more precisely, when all elements but the final element have the same type. Isonyms exist when two authors give the same combinations to the same type, that is, all elements of two combinations have the same types. Pseudo-isonyms exist when different authors give the same combination to the same subordinate element but the inclusive (higher rank) elements have different types. Examples of all are given and it is concluded that later isonyms are nomenclatural non-entities, later homonyms are illegitimate, and later pseudo-isonyms are not illegitimate under the present Code.
10.2307/1219498|Lectotype species are designated for four generic names: Arisarum, Desmesia, Dracunculus and Heteropsis.
10.2307/1219504|Although the binomial Nelumbo pentapetala (Walter) Fernald was published in 1934 as the correct name for the American Nelumbo, it has not been generally accepted. The combination is based on Nymphaea pentapetala Walter, a nomenclaturally legitimate, although inappropriate, name. The rejection of Fernald's combination on the grounds that it was based on a monstrosity does not seem pertinent. The type for the taxon is Walter's description as no trace has been found of the specimen upon which Walter based his name and description.
10.2307/1219505|Dadoxylon annulatum Dawson is based on material obscured by the state of preservation. Frentzen, however, describes material in terms referring to a true species clearly distinguishable, also anatomically from the Dawson material.
10.2307/1220717|The eight species of Magnolia native to the United States are pollinated by a variety of beetles. Flower color as well as floral odors, produced primarily by the androphore, attract the insects. Analysis of the floral odors using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, indicates that aliphatic hydrocarbons, methyl esters and terpenes comprise the fragrances. A quantitative correlation of the species of Magnolia was developed utilizing the composition of the floral odors.
10.2307/1220719|Fifteen years have elapsed since the establishment of the Progymnospermopsida, a class of plants showing both pteridophytic reproduction and gymnospermous anatomy. Subsequent work has yielded many taxa ascribed to the group but only a few show the dual characteristics upon which the class was founded: Archaeopteris, Protopitys, Tetraxylopteris, Aneurophyton and Rellimia. Our concept of this extinct group must be based on these few genera. All five are similar in the branching pattern of their fructifications, dichotomous then pinnate. This is obvious in Tetraxylopteris, Rellimia and Protopitys, less so in Archaeopteris and Aneurophyton. The other taxa merely show similarities to one or another of the above, but not the combination of characters diagnostic of the group. They should be treated as form genera assigned only tentatively to the progymnosperms. Such isolated pieces of anatomy, vegetative axes and sporangial fragments add little to the concept. If incorrectly assigned, due to parallelisms in other plant groups, the evolutionary, ecological and stratigraphic value of the Progymnospermopsida would be obscured.
10.2307/1220722|Classification by color, a stable communicative referent, can be a useful tool of taxonomy. Conceptions of the arbitrariness of color designation have in the past limited the use of this classification criterion. Recent research, however, has proved these conceptions rather misconceptions. Universals of color naming and color designation which are based on visual processes have been unearthed. Consequently, practical recommendations for the systematization of classification by color can be proposed: They include standardization of nomenclature, an objective chromatic correlate system, and color vision tests for taxonomists.
10.2307/1220725|A new classification of the suprageneric taxa of Euphorbiaceae is presented in outline, including a key to the five subfamilies recognized. Latin descriptions are provided for seven new tribes and ten new subtribes.
10.2307/1220729| The Adansonian and the more traditional taxonomic principles may be combined in an iterative information-seeking strategy of classification. Uniqueness is not a property of biological classifications, and even the wishfully fundamental principle of parsimony has not brought to taxonomy the strong basis on which uniqueness could rest. On the other hand, it can be shown that descriptors have different values along the scale of taxonomic categories, and that different descriptors have different values for the same partition. It is then suggested that an ideal taxonomic treatment should begin with a large body of equally weighted descriptors, and lead to deletion, re-structuring and a posteriori weighting of the descriptors, through recognition of the main clusters and a measure of the contribution of each descriptor to each partition of the objects. The analysis could then continue, for each partition independently, by an iteration between clustering, discrimination and weighting, until stability is reached. /// [French] Il est possible de combiner les principes d'Adanson avec ceux de la taxonomie classique, en une stratgie itrative qui amliore  chaque cycle la classification produite. Les classifications biologiques n'ont pas la proprit d'unicit; mme le principe de parcimonie, que l'on a voulu fondamental, n'a pas apport  la taxonomie cette base sur laquelle on aurait pu rechercher des classifications uniques. D'autre part, on peut dmontrer que les descripteurs n'ont pas la mme valeur tout au long de l'chelle des catgories taxonomiques, et que diffrents descripteurs ont aussi des valeurs diffrentes pour une mme partition. Un traitement taxonomique idal devrait donc dbuter avec un grand nombre de descripteurs  poids gaux, mais permettre par la suite de laisser tomber, de re-structurer ou d'attribuer a posteriori des poids aux descripteurs, aprs que l'on ait reconnu les principaux groupes d'objets et que l'on ait mesur la contribution de chaque descripteur  chacune des partitions des objets. L'analyse pourrait alors se poursuivre de faon indpendante pour chaque partition, par un cycle: groupement des objets, discrimination, et modification du poids attribu  chaque descripteur, jusqu' ce que l'on en arrive  une solution de stabilit. 
10.2307/1220730|A taxonomic character for a group of organisms under study is said to be divergent or uniquely derived for that group if, during the evolution of that group, each character state arose only once. Homologous amino acid positions in homologous proteins can be thought of as taxonomic characters whose states are amino acids. In a similar way, DNA nucleotide positions can also be considered taxonomic characters. In the exposition below, we describe a simple test to determine when it is not possible for two amino acid (or nucleotide) positions to be divergent at the same time.
10.2307/1220732| Die Anwendung der "biologischen Art" im Sinne einer potentiellen Fortpflanzungsgemeinschaft wird unter Hinweis auf andere Autoren erneut angeregt. Fr die infraspezifische Gliederung werden 3 Kategorien vorgeschlagen, die durch Definition gegeneinander abgegrenzt werden knnen: Subspezies als geographisch isolierte Teilpopulation, Praespezies als morphologisch differenzierter, aber nicht isolierter Individuenverband (beide Kategorien werden als gleichrangig angesehen), Varietten als Mutanten, die einzeln oder in kleineren Gruppen im Gesamtareal einer Art auftreten. Ophrys fuciflora (Crantz) Moench und Ophrys scolopax Cav. mssen als Angehrige einer Art angesehen werden. Die von ihnen beschriebenen Sippen werden nach den gegebenen Vorgeschlgen eingestuft. 
10.2307/1220734|When dealing with ornamental woody plants, the term cultivar is most often applied to clones. Under the International Code of Nomenclature of Cultivated Plants, however, cultivar has a much wider conceptual definition and a potentially wide range of application. As a category without rank, cultivars may be selected from within a botanical category at any infraspecific rank, may comprise the entire ranked category, or may cut across botanical categories of the same or different rank. Botanical epithets that have been assigned to garden varieties (cultivars), if correctly proposed as botanical combinations, cannot be repudiated because they were based on cultivars. It is not the function of nomenclature to dictate what can and cannot be recognized in the infraspecific classification of a species. Because the intent of botanical nomenclature and the nomenclature of cultivated plants is not the same, the use of Latin epithets should be restricted to botanical considerations. New cultivars, even if they comprise ranked botanical categories, should be given fancy or vernacular names to point out this difference of intention.
10.2307/1220735|Seventeen Typha populations from the United States were subjected to a detailed analysis of variation in morphology, isozymes (alcohol dehydrogenase and esterase) and fertility. The isozyme data was analyzed using numerical taxonomy. All of the three sets of data were employed in a hybrid analysis of the populations. Little morphological variation was detected compared to isozyme differences in populations of all taxa. The results led to the conclusion that the morphological characters in Typha are tightly linked genetic packages which do not reflect a complex pattern of hybridization and introgression seen more clearly from the biochemical analysis. It was further concluded that hybridization and introgression are important reproductive phenomena between the two species, introgression occuring primarily in the direction of T. angustifolia. The effect of human environmental disruption will be to decrease the abundance of T. latifolia populations and enlarge the distribution of hybrid and introgressant populations.
10.2307/1220737|Plants collected in North Carolina and determined to be Gracilaria mammillaris (Montagne) Howe are compared to G. veleroae Dawson of Pacific Mexico. The two species are found to be conspecific and are synonymized under the correct name G. mammillaris.

10.2307/1220743| Philippe van Tieghem's "Recherches sur la structure du pistil et sur l'anatomie compare de la fleur" is shown to have been issued as a separate in 1871, although the volume of the journal in which it appeared was not completed until 1875. The accurate citation for the journal is "Mm. Prs. Divers Savants Acad. Sci. Inst. Imprial France." The frequently encountered citation "Mm. Savants trangers" is a ghost reference and thus should not be used. It is recommended that in bibliographies the reference be dated "1875" but that the following note be added after the citation: "Issued as a separate in 1871". In an addendum it is shown that G. Henslow's "second edition" (1893) of "The origin of floral structures"... is merely a reprinting and not a second edition.

10.2307/1220409|Although relatively few biochemical studies have been carried out on woody plants, interesting correlations (and discrepancies) have been noted between nuclear DNA content and several parameters such as geographic range (latitude), ecological adaptation, nuclear volume, and karyotypic differences such as chromosome length. Hybridization between genomes with complements possessing chromosomes of different relative sizes, B chromosomes, and repetitious DNA and heterochromatin, have been reasons advanced for changes in karyotypes and nuclear DNA response. B chromosomes may not be as rare in tree species as previously considered. It may be expected that DNA-RNA hybridization and Giemsa staining procedures will reveal differences in karyotypes between species in genera where genomes at present exhibit only moderate differences between species. While successful callus production has been induced for a number of woody species, so far no haploid trees have been produced. In Betula there appears to be little barrier to cross fertilization and plants with different euploid chromosome numbers have been obtained from seed from the same parental tree.
10.2307/1220411|The work on Electronic Data Processing-Information Retrieval (EDP-IR) in the Colombian National Herbarium (COL) is described. The importance and relevance of automation and the practical difficulties encountered are discussed. A short review of the steps involved in up-dating and correcting the data bank is also included.
10.2307/1220412| The European - North African - West Asiatic Galium palustre-group is a polyploid complex. The aberrant basic chromosome number x=12 was confirmed for the group, and further diploid (2x), tetraploid (4x), octoploid (8x) and (for the first time) dodecaploid (12x) populations were found. In polyploids uni- and multivalents are fairly common in PMC meiosis, and average chromosome size decreases with increasing ploidy level. Chromosome number and size of grains PMCs and pollen grains are correlated. Morphological similarities of 2x and 4x within G. palustre, and of 8x and 12x within G. elongatum suggest  autopolyploid origin of these cytotypes and militate against their taxonomic recognition. On the other hand, morphological and ecological differences back separation of the predominantly temperate-boreal G. palustre (2x, 4x), the mediterranean-atlantic G. debile (2x) and the temperate-mediterranean G. elongatum (8x, 12x), and the allopolyploid origin of the latter. 
10.2307/1220414| [French] Pour dterminer les voies volutives gnrales des plantules de la Famille des Euphorbiaceae, les germinations de 131 espces ont t obtenues. Les caractres plantulaires ont t tudis, spcialement la forme et la taille des cotyldons, ainsi que la structure et le trajet des faisceaux vasculaires dans les diffrentes parties de la plantule. En corrlation avec l'volution des adultes (essentiellement connue d'aprs les travaux de Pax, Pax et Hoffmann, Hutchinson il est dmontr que la taille des cotyldons volue de faon pseudocyclique, c'est--dire que les tailles rduites des cotyldons des Phyllantheae (primitives) sont suivies par l'accroissement de la taille jusqu'aux grands cotyldons de Jatropha curcas (stade volu), et dcroissent ensuite (phase survolue: Euphorbia); c'est un retour apparent au type ancestral.

Les plantules d'Euphorbia (pour les 4 sections tudies) montrent un pseudocycle rduit inclus dans celui de la famille. /// In order to recognize the main evolutionary trends in the seedlings of the family Euphorbiaceae, the germinations of 131 species were obtained. The seedlings were studied, with special reference to the shape and size of cotyledons, and the structure and behaviour of the vascular bundles in the various seedlings parts. In correlation to the evolution of the adults (known from the works of Pax, Pax and Hoffmann, Hutchinson), if was demonstrated that the morphological seedling characters show a pseudocyclic evolution in the size; that is, the very small cotyledon size of the Phyllantheae (primitive) was followed by an increase in size until the "giant cotyledons" of Jatropha curcas (evolved stage), and by a decrease (overevolved phase: Euphorbia); this gives an apparent return to the ancestral type. This pseudocycle is correlated with the pseudocyclic evolution of the vascular structure of the seedling; the Euphorbiaceae show at first 4 hypocotylary bundles (Phyllanthus-type), then 8 (Bischoffia-type); later this number decreases to 6 (hexafasciculary Euphorbia-type), and finaly to 4 (tetrafasciculary Euphorbia-type). Since other typical examples of pseudocyclic evolution are known (after Gaussen) this phylogenic mechanism seems to have a certain general significance. The Euphorbia-seedlings (of the four investigated sections) show in their evolution a smaller pseudocycle included in that of the family.

10.2307/1220418|When Bernhardi established Tmesipteris in 1801 he based it on Lycopodium tannense Spreng., described the previous year from a collection supposedly made on Tanna Island (New Hebrides) by the Forsters. The holotype of L. tannense, the type species of Tmesipteris, has not been located and it is presumed destroyed. Tmesipteris is now generally considered polyspecific and since the protologue account of L. tannense is only sufficient to place the species in Tmesipteris further identification, to distinguish it from other species now recognized, is necessary. As no isotype of L. tannense has been located the figure in Bernhardi's paper, which is considered to depict the type collection, is selected as neotype. The type collection of L. tannense was stated by Sprengel to have been collected on Tanna Island. However, the morphological, biogeographical and historical evidence suggests that the collection was made in New Zealand, probably at Dusky Sound. Tmesipteris tannensis (Spreng.) Bernh. is now considered to be restricted to New Zealand, and the reference by Sprengel to Tanna Island is considered an error.
10.2307/1220420|When Linnaeus described the Silverbell Tree or Snowdrop Tree, Halesia carolina, in 1759, he based his description upon flowering and fruiting specimens, plus an illustration, sent to him by John Ellis of England. The plant specimens were gathered by Alexander Garden in late June or early July of 1755 near Saluda, South Carolina, and sent to Ellis in March of 1756 shortly after a small shipment of seeds had been sent. The illustration was prepared by George D. Ehret. The exact nature of the specimens and plate has not been carefully investigated until now, and our studies show that this material represents the same entity currently called H. parviflora Michx. and not what is presently termed H. carolina by all modern authors. In 1761, Ellis proposed H. tetraptera based on a description sent to him by Garden of plants growing "along the banks of Santee river." Apparently no specimens were collected of this entity. However, seeds were, and these were soon widely cultivated in Europe and have served as the basis for the understanding of H. carolina. Based on the location data and the description provided by Ellis (citing a letter sent to him by Garden), the name H. tetraptera should apply to what is now called H. carolina by current authors. The original Ehret plate must now serve as the type for H. carolina as the specimens have been lost, and the illustration presented in Ellis' 1761 paper which is a slightly altered, mirror image (and thus a reingraving) of the original Ehret plate, does not represent -- in any manner -- the type of the plant described by Ellis as H. tetraptera, a fact quite unknown to him and others. A neotype is selected for H. tetraptera, and the combination, H. tetraptera var. monticola, proposed.
10.2307/1220421|Considerable confusion has arisen in the taxonomic literature over the correct spelling and valid publication of the type genus of the Erythroxylaceae: Erythroxylum P. Browne vs. Erythroxylon Linnaeus. The oldest name Erythroxylum was first published by Patrick Browne in 1756 in his "Civil and Natural History of Jamaica". Although Browne followed the basic order of Linnaeus, he employed a typographically unique format in presenting his new generic descriptions. On this basis, certain botanists have rejected Browne's new genera as having been invalidly published. These authors accept instead Erythroxylon published by Linnaeus in 1759 with a change in spelling of the name. Arguments presented here contend that Erythroxylum P. Browne was validly published and recommend that this spelling be accepted and stabilized.

10.2307/1220424|The Sloane Herbarium includes six West African plant specimens collected by Nicholas Staphorst, son of Nicolaus Staphorst, director of the Chemical Laboratory of the Royal College of Physicians in London. The father was an immigrant from Hamburg, who belonged to an important German family from Staphorst in Low-Saxon. Nicholas, the son, travelled to South Africa, West India and West Africa where he attempted to collect plants for Petiver. He failed in South Africa and in western India he lost his collection during embarkation, and apparently succeeded in collecting only the six specimens in West Africa, probably in 1701.
10.2307/1220436|New anatomical confirmation of the identity of Licaria Aubl. (Lauraceae) is reported, with a criticism of Lundell's double set of names in Licaria and Misanteca.
10.2307/1219442|Our knowledge of patterns of variation and evolution in groups of allied species of the north temperate flora is gradually increasing; but relatively few groups have been studied cytotaxonomically or analysed genomically. Data for three groups of species, in the genera Viola, Maianthemum and Polypodium, are reviewed, and resemblances and differences between them discussed. The importance of further biosystematic work of this kind, including ecological as well as taxonomic studies, and organised on an international basis, is pointed out.
10.2307/1219444|Oaks exemplify problems with the reproductive species concept which motivate a reconsideration of the use and nature of species. Ecology is important in the reconsideration. The species level is usually overemphasized in evolutionary thought; selection acts on phenotypes and any mutualistic units. Standard definitions tend to inhibit free conceptual progress. Multispecies, sets of broadly sympatric species that exchange genes, may occur among animals as well as plants and may conceivably bridge kingdoms. This phenomenon can be adaptively important. There may be taxa without species. The degree of modality of adaptive zones can be investigated empirically.
10.2307/1219447|An index for comparing weediness in plants can be constructed from site information on herbarium specimen labels. The percent of the species collected from disturbed sites is a measure of weediness. Some examples are presented in Cerastium, Polygonum, and Aster.
10.2307/1219449|It is shown how principal component analysis can be extended to allow for multi-state discrete characters as well as continuous characters. When all the characters are discrete, the proposed extension reduces to correspondence analysis. A taxonomic example is given to illustrate the method in practice. The technique allows the estimation of a taxonomic distance between objects which have been scored for multi-state characters. However, taxonomic structure may be better inferred directly from the ordination, rather than by constructing a taxonomic distance measure.
10.2307/1219450|An approach to character assessment is proposed in which states within characters are weighted. It is suitable for use with Gower's general coefficient of resemblance. Values of character-states are determined intuitively or through appropriate transformations. The aim of this approach is to incorporate information available on the relative closeness of the states, into classificatory studies. This information usually becomes lost at the coding stage because of the practice of equidistant states.
10.2307/1219451|Transmission electron microscopy of the pollen of Parthenice mollis Gray reveals a helianthoid structural pattern. This pattern is characteristic of the subtribe Melampodinae, in which this species has been traditionally placed. Earlier reports of P. mollis pollen indicated an ultrastructural pattern which was characteristic of the Ambrosiinae (i.e., not typically helianthoid): herbarium material upon which this earlier work was based was incorrectly determined, the specimen concerned being Iva ambrosaefolia Gray.
10.2307/1219452|An ultrastructural investigation of sieve-elements of nine species of Tamaricales (including Fouquieria and Frankenia) demonstrated plastids of the starch-storing S-type. Sieve-elements of Rhabdodendron (Rutaceae) contained P-type plastids with a single polygonal protein crystalloid besides starch grains. In these respects all these species are unlike the specific P-type plastids characteristic of the Centrospermae.
10.2307/1219453|Attention is drawn to the similarity between two classifications of Ericaceae. The later of these is here held to be an extension with minor modifications of the earlier one, which was derived with the aid of a computer.
10.2307/1219455|Lindley's original description of Opuntia aurantiaca, which is an economically important weed in South Africa and eastern Australia, is accurate but he was mistaken in recording that Gillies originally collected the plant and that it came from Chile. These errors are the basis of confusion about the identity and distribution of this cactus. Evidence is presented to show that O. aurantiaca is an introduced floral element in Argentina and Uruguay and a study of the biography of the botanist Nicholas Nugent, indicates that the West Indies may be the original distributional centre of this plant.
10.2307/1219457|The taxonomic affinities of the Neottioideae (Orchidaceae) and, in particular, of its Australian members, have been examined, employing numerical taxonomic methods. Two analyses were carried out -- the first, discussed only briefly, involved a sample of the entire family and the second a sample of the Neottioideae as defined by the first analysis. The analyses were carried out by the Euclidean-based Group Average (or Mean Squared Distance) strategy and checked by means of a Principal Co-ordinate Analysis. The analysis of the Neottioideae indicated that this subfamily comprised two groups -- Diurideae, including the tuber-forming Australian taxa and the Neottieae which do not possess tubers and are cosmopolitan in distribution. A possible scheme of classification of the Neottioideae is presented and relationships within the group are briefly discussed.
10.2307/1219458|Nomenclatural histories and usages are discussed for five binomials used for pearl millet (Pennisetum typhoideum, P. typhoides, P. spicatum, P. glaucum, P. americanum) and two binomials used for yellow foxtail (Setaria glauca, S. lutescens). Linnaean and pre-Linnaean concepts of Panicum glaucum L. and Panicum americanum L. are reviewed in detail. The controversial basionym, Panicum glaucum, is applied to yellow foxtail, in agreement with Linnaeus's treatment in the second edition of Species Plantarum. The name Panicum americanum clearly referred to pearl millet. A commonly-used combination, Pennisetum americanum (L). K. Schumann, is incorrect because Schumann did not accept it. The correct names are Pennisetum americanum (L.) Leeke (pearl millet) and Setaria glauca (L.) Beauv. (yellow foxtail).
10.2307/1219460|In 1961 de Wit typified Mimosa latisiliqua L., Sp. Pl. 1: 519 (1753), the basionym of Lysiloma latisiliquum (L.) Benth. and Leucaena latisiliqua (L.) Gillis, by a Plumier illustration published by Burman in 1755 but based on one among 500 Plumier drawings seen by Linnaeus in Holland in 1738. Gillis & Stearn (1974) rejected this typification, albeit reluctantly, on the ground that (1) this illustration was not available to Linnaeus when preparing the Species Plantarum (1753), that (2) there was no evidence of his making notes on these drawings in 1738 for later use and that (3) he must have had another source of evidence. The second two suppositions can now be proved incorrect. Linnaeus's notes are to be found in an interleaved copy of the first edition of his Genera Plantarum (1737). They include a reference to the Plumier plant which he later named Mimosa latisiliqua and also to many other West Indian species drawn by Plumier. The type of M. latisiliqua is accordingly a copy of a Plumier drawing now at Groningen, the typotype is Plumier's original drawing at Paris; it represents the species later named Lysiloma bahamense Benth., for which the name L. latisiliquum (L.) Benth. should be re-instated; Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit remains the correct name for L. glauca Benth. The choice of Linnaean Herbarium 1228.19 to typify Mimosa latisiliqua as advocated by Gillis & Stearn (1974) is to be rejected because this specimen does not satisfactorily fit the Linnaean protologue.
10.2307/1219464|Twenty-seven specimens, collected between 1788 and 1795 by John White, Surgeon-General to Port Jackson, New South Wales, Australia, are listed. Their original names and the names in current use are given, with bibliographic citations, data from specimen labels, and locality information from original descriptions. A history of the specimens is also given.
10.2307/1220521| After a brief resum of the principal alternatives the author concludes that the only reasonable hypothesis for the fully autogenous development of the eukaryotes is that involving a cyanophyte-like photosynthetic ancestor: the "Uralga." A structurally explicit scenario for the internal events necessary to produce general eukarotic organisation within that framework is outlined. Central to the model is the progressive differentiation of membrane systems, leading to enclosure of specialised, double-membraned metabolic compartments by engulfment during the stage in which endo- and exocytotic properties were attained. Some minor differences between this model and that of Cavalier-Smith (1975) are discussed. The paper concludes with some comments about hypotheses involving endosymbiosis, including the virtues of a compromise hypothesis in which mitochondria arose autogenously, but chloroplasts arose by endosymbiosis. 
10.2307/1220522|The assumption is made that photosynthesis evolved in prokaryotes and was acquired by symbiosis in all eukaryotes. By studies of comparative mitosis and genetic systems of "lower" eukaryotes (e.g., nucleate algae, protozoa, flagellated fungi and so forth) consistent phylogenies of these organisms may be constructed. It follows logically from these considerations that the traditional concept of "plant" and "animal" kingdoms are obsolete. An internally consistent modification of Whittakers five kingdoms (Monera, Protist, Fungi, Animal and Plant) is represented and defended on the basis of information from ultrastructure, comparative biochemistry and life cycles, molecular biology and other modern work. Higher taxa (Kingdoms, Phyla, Classes) for major groups based on the recognition of the prokaryotic-eukaryotic dichotomy is offered for critical evaluation.
10.2307/1220524|Variation in Cannabis is evaluated in the context of the confusing systematic history of this genus. Aside from some experimentally produced polyploids, all Cannabis is diploid (n = 10), and there appear to be no barriers to successful hybridization within the genus. The present pattern of variation is due in large part to the influence of man. Two widespread classes of plant are discernible: a group of generally northern plants of relatively limited intoxicant potential, influenced particularly by selection for fibre and oil agronomic qualities, and a group of generally southern plants of considerable intoxicant potential, influenced particularly by selection for inebriant qualities. These two groups are treated respectively as subsp. sativa and indica, of C. sativa, the only species of the genus Cannabis. Within each subspecies two parallel phases are recognizable. The "wild" (weedy, naturalized or indigenous) phase is more or less distinguishable from the domesticated (cultivated or spontaneous) phase by means of an adaptive syndrome of fruit characteristics. The resulting four discernible groups are recognized as varieties.
10.2307/1220526|Phenetic analyses are valuable at all taxonomic ranks. A review of work at higher ranks is presented, and certain difficulties are discussed: these are just as serious for traditional studies, though often glossed over. Difficulties include determination of homologies, incompleteness of data and shortage of constant characters. It is also necessary to employ similarity coefficients and cluster methods that are not too sensitive, respectively, to effects of gross size and numbers of OTU's. The number of OTU's required to represent a homogeneous cluster is apt to be underestimated: even with a simplified model of phenetic variation this number should be at least 10 and preferably 25 or more. Some newer developments in numerical analysis of phylogeny are briefly reviewed.
10.2307/1220527|Data of Heiser et al. (1965) on species, hybrids, autoploids, and alloploids in Solanum were re-examined using additional methods of numerical analysis. The phenogram produced after the removal of hybrids from the data matrix indicated that distortion of taxa observed in the phenogram of the previous study was due to the influence of hybrids. Hybrids, with one exception, were found to fall in an intermediate position relative to their parents in the graph obtained from principal components analysis. The ability to display intermediate groups makes principal components analysis better suited than cluster analysis for revealing hybrids from phenetic data.
10.2307/1220528|This study presents 126 original reports of chromosome numbers for 101 taxa of North American Astragalus; 46 are the first records for species. Chromosome numbers are now known from at least one count for slightly more than 40% of the North American species; on a world wide basis about 80% of the species are still unknown from a single count. This study supports earlier work demonstrating the basic division between Old World species, including their close New World relatives (x = 8, euploidy common), and strictly New World lineages (x = 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, euploidy rare). Two euploids of New World relationship, A. layneae Greene and A. pictiformis Barneby, are added to the long known A. grayi Parry ex Wats.; all are 2n = 44. The number 2n = 30 is reported for the first time in New World species, being recorded for A. guatemalensis Hemsl., A. radicans Hornm., A. ervoides H. & A., A. parvus Hemsl., and A. diphacus Wats. All are Mexican species; some are considered primitive, others advanced. The chromosome number 2n = 22 is also reported for primitive species. It is proposed, therefore, that the New World species originated from a tetraploid of 2n = 32 or a hypotetraploid, evolutionary radiation in some lineages concommitant with descending aneuploidy, in other lineages with little or no change in number.
10.2307/1220529|Mecodium as a subdivision of the genus Hymenophyllum has a different type than when it is ranked as a genus. As a legitimate generic name, it must be typified by M. diversilabium Copel., a fact overlooked since the original publication, and many combinations have been made in a later homonym. If considered to apply to the original genus, these combinations are later pseudo-isonyms. It is argued that later pseudo-isonyms have no actual existence in nomenclature and do not necessitate the making of new combinations.
10.2307/1220530|Herbarium labels were photographed using single frames of 8 mm movie film. Up to 3200 labels can be captured on a 15 m roll of film. Total costs for capturing 60,000 labels was only $ 735 (1.2c/label) (US$). This should be an inexpensive method to transmit label data and decrease specimen borrowing for distribution mapping purposes.
10.2307/1220106|A variety of schemes are employed currently for the classification of plants into higher taxa. The two most widely used schemes, the traditional kingdom Plantae with sub-kingdoms Thallophyta and Embryophyta, and the Whittaker five-kingdom system with plants in the kingdoms Monera, Protista, Fungi and Plantae, rely on nineteenth century morphological criteria for delimitation of taxa that result in polyphyletic assemblages of organisms. It is proposed that plants be assigned to seven kingdoms, subordinate to the superkingdoms Procaryota and Eucaryota which are based on the procaryotic and eucaryotic types of cellular organization. The distribution of accessory chlorophylls is used as a major taxonomic criterion for classifying photosynthetic organisms at the kingdom level. This results in a single kingdom, the Cyanochlorobionta for photosynthetic plants containing chlorophyll a only within the superkingdom Procaryota. Photosynthetic plants within the superkingdom Eucaryota have been divided into three groups, the kingdom Erythrobionta for organisms with no accessory chlorophyll or occasionally chlorophyll d (and lacking flagella), the kingdom Chlorobionta for organisms with accessory chlorophyll b, and the Ochrobionta for those organisms with accessory chlorophyll c. Vascular plants have been assigned to a single division, the Tracheophyta, since in addition to having a similar biochemistry (chlorophylls a and b, similar carotenoids, starch as a reserve food product) they possess also a basic morphological groundplan -- a vascular system containing xylem and phloem, and a life history consisting of an alternation of generations. The fungi have been assigned three kingdoms as opposed to most extant schemes of classification in which they are allocated to a single polyphyletic assemblage. The true fungi have been divided into kingdoms Fungi 1 and Fungi 2 since it is thought that they have evolved from the Chlorobionta and Ochrobionta, respectively; the myxomycetes have been placed in a third kingdom, the Myxobionta.
10.2307/1220107|Recent reproductive biology studies reveal high levels of self-incompatibility in species diverse tropical communities. Many tropical trees are animal pollinated, pollen transfer patterns closely following the energetics of foraging. The energy output (in the form of nectar, pollen and other food bodies) of a single massively flowering tropical tree is far in excess of the demands of a single pollinating individual. This being so, a large proportion of the pollen transfers in tropical trees are geitonogamous and genetically equivalent to self-pollination. It is here argued that the tendency for high levels of geitonogamy, which presumably increase with decreasing population density or increasing species diversity has been the major factor in the spread and perhaps initial evolution of pre-zygotic self-incompatibility mechanisms in the angiosperms.
10.2307/1220108|A comparative study of leaf architecture throughout the Angiosperms has been made and six classes of venation patterns are recognised. The terms employed are defined and arranged in a systematic order for convenience of reference. Some new terms have been introduced where greater precision was needed and for little known venation patterns.
10.2307/1220110|Five genera are recognized in the tribe Vicieae (Adanson) de Candolle ex Seringe (Fabaceae): Cicer Linnaeus, Lathyrus Linnaeus, Lens P. Miller, Pisum Linnaeus, and Vicia Linnaeus. A recently proposed genus, Vavilovia Fedorov, is placed in synonymy under Pisum, and a new subgenus is founded. Another recently proposed genus, Anatropostylia (Plitmann) Kupicha, is placed in synonymy under Vicia. Flowers of 261 of approximately 350 recognized species were surveyed for these characters: type of filament apex, type of androecial sheath apex, stigma shape, style shape, stylar hair pattern, type of stylar base, and ovary surface. These data are condified and illustrated.
10.2307/1220113|Botanists have used Styrax in all genders. The etymology of Styrax, the problems with its classical and dictionary genders, and arguments for and against the various botanical genders are evaluated. We find that the Linnaean adoption of neuter was a simple error, the use of feminine has only theoretical justification and that masculine gender best fits the wording of our present (Botanical) Code for Styrax, as well as Panax.
10.2307/1220115|Type specimens of six names published by Colla in 1833, which were collected by Martius in Brazil, were examined. These names have been either ignored or treated as "insufficiently known" in the literature of the family Malvaceae. One of the six names, Sida tomentosa Martius ex Colla, remains a nomen dubium. Four of the names were found to be the correct names of the species in question (Pavonia lanceolata Colla, Pavonia martii Colla, Sida nemorensis Martius ex Colla, and Sida setosa Martius ex Colla). One name (Hibiscus anonimus Martius ex Colla) is reduced to synonymy under Pavonia cancellata (Linn. f.) Cavanilles. A description and illustration are provided for Pavonia lanceolata.
10.2307/1220118|Recent renewed interest in the suprageneric classification of the Rubiaceae has made a clarification of the subfamilial, tribal, and subtribal nomenclature an urgent necessity. Presented here is a list of all suprageneric names published within the Rubiaceae, with an indication of their nomenclatural status; names of segregate families are also included. Attention is drawn to various problems concerning the interpretation of the "International Code of Botanical Nomenclature" with regard to the names of taxa published between the ranks of family and genus. Three subfamilial and ten tribal names are validated with Latin descriptions or diagnoses.
10.2307/1220120|Four different numerical methods using only intensity of phenolic spots, intensity of the spots and the spot-areas and the spot-areas alone, were assessed for their value in defining relationships among Citrus species where such relationships are thought to be well known. It was found that biochemical distance or biochemical difference calculated from the spot area without squaring and by simply adding the differences most useful. This method reduced the over-weighting of characteristic spots that occurs when the differences are squared.
10.2307/1220121|This is the first attempt in Pakistan to relate frequency of polyploidy to life-form and geographical distribution. In dicotyledonous plants the degree of ploidy was found to be at all levels from triploid to decaploid while in monocotyledonous plants, tetraploids and pentaploids were noted. The perennials, in dicots as well as in monocots, had a higher percentage of polyploidy than annuals, being 47.6% in dicots and 40.0% in monocots in contrast to 39.6% and 21.6% in annual dicots and monocots respectively. Six large families investigated for percentage of polyploidy -- Malvaceae, Solanaceae, Gramineae, Compositae, Leguminosae and Convolvulaceae -- showed 90.0%, 89.7%, 30.4%, 22.2%, 19.2% and 85.7% respectively, which supports earlier conclusions, that percentage of polyploidy varies from family to family as much or more than from one latitude to another.
10.2307/1220132|Dryopteris oreades Fomin replaces the name D. abbreviata (DC.) Newman for one of the sexual diploid species in the D. filix-mas (L.) Schott aggregate on two main grounds. First, the original concept of de Candolle was not that of the sexual diploid taxon; however the actual identity of de Candolle's taxon, though probably D. pseudomas (Wollaston) Holub & Pouzar, is open to considerable doubt and cannot now be ascertained. Various interpretations have been followed with a preponderance in favour of its incorrect application to the sexual diploid taxon. Thus the name Polystichum abbreviatum DC. has become a long-persistent source of error and it should be regarded as a nomen ambiguum. Secondly, the taxon P. abbreviatum DC. was accepted in Dryopteris by Newman at varietal rank only and he did not make the combination D. abbreviata (DC.) Newm. so frequently attributed to him. Moreover the combination can no longer be made because of the publication of D. abbreviata (Schrad.) O. Kuntze (1891), based on Aspidium abbreviatum Schrader, an unrelated taxon.
10.2307/1220133|The name of the holotype of the generic name Penicillium Fr. (1832), "Mucor crustaceus L.", is considered to be a nomen dubium and to probably represent a member of a genus other than Penicillium as currently conceived. In order to preserve current usage of the name Penicillium, the conservation of Penicillium Link ex Gray (1821) with P. expansum Link ex Gray as the lectotype species is proposed. Conservation is necessary as the publication of Fries (1832) is starting point work for this group of fungi. Penicillium expansum Link ex Gray is neotypified in accordance with the usage of this name by Thom (1910) and later authors.
10.2307/1220193|It is generally agreed that the first organisms were prokaryotic in nature. However, opinions differ as to the mechanism responsible for the origin of the eukaryotic cell -- whether it arose by direct filiation from an ancestral blue-green alga or by a series of symbioses. The timing of the emergence of photosynthesis in eukaryotes has largely been based on evidence from Precambrian palaeontology. For this reason attention is drawn to recent reassessments of the Precambrian fossil record, which have suggested that a number of structures previously considered to be remnants of eukaryotic nuclei and organelles may instead have been artifacts that formed in certain blue-green algae during their lithification. Evidence regarding the mechanism responsible for the origin of chloroplasts may be sought in the molecular fossil record. Studies employing the techniques of DNA-RNA hybridization and RNA sequencing (oligonucleotide cataloguing) have established the prokaryotic nature of chloroplast ribosomal RNAs. In addition, a close phylogenetic relationship between the blue-green alga Aphanocapsa 6308 and the chloroplasts of Euglena gracilis has been indicated. By contrast, the sequence resemblance of prokaryotic and chloroplast 16 S rRNAs to eukaryotic 18 S rRNAs is revealed to be no greater than that expected between completely unrelated molecules. However, the size differences which exist between 16 S and 18 S rRNAs raise doubts as to whether these RNA species are in fact directly comparable. On the other hand, all known examples of mature 5 S rRNA are approximately 120 nucleotides in length, and thus this RNA would appear to bridge the evolutionary discontinuity between prokaryotes and eukaryotes in an almost unambiguous manner. The identification of 5 S rRNA in chloroplast ribosomes has therefore prompted a number of investigations designed to establish the prokaryotic or eukaryotic affinities of this RNA species. These have confirmed the prokaryotic nature of chloroplast 5 S rRNAs, and have indicated the sequence dissimilarity of these species to the cytoplasmic 5 S rRNAs of eukaryotes. However, it is pointed out that such results can only provide conclusive support for the endosymbiotic hypothesis, if rates of change in homologous RNAs have remained approximately constant in all lines. Combined evidence suggests that nucleotide substitutions in cytoplasmic ribosomal RNAs have occurred more frequently during the evolution of flowering plants, Gramineae in particular, than during the evolution of yeast or vertebrates. By contrast, chloroplast ribosomal RNAs are shown to be very strongly conserved. Moreover, considerable disparities are also noted in the relative amounts of change in prokaryotic and eukaryotic 5 S rRNAs. Although undoubtedly associated with their different architectures and functional roles, it is suggested that the primary explanation for this phenomenon lies in the fact that the cytoplasmic 5 S rRNAs of eukaryotes are not derived from that of the protoeukaryote host, but rather, from that of the protomitochondrion. The cytoplasmic 5.8 rRNAs are now considered to be the extant descendants of the original protoeukaryote 5 S rRNA these species having increased in size in a similar manner to the other cytoplasmic ribosomal RNAs of eukaryotes. Because the rates of nucleotide substitution in homologous prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomal RNAs are non-identical, consideration is given to derived character states.

10.2307/1220194|In order to assess the systematic relations within the tribe Genisteae, the water-soluble seed proteins of 45 species have been studied serologically. The reaction was tested by immunodiffusion and the results have been processed by cluster analysis and by principal component analysis. Based on these data, the genus Cytisus s.l. (incl. Chamaecytisus, Sarothamnus and Corothamnus) represents a single homogeneous unit, except for C. sessilifolius, which appears to be more closely related to Laburnum and to Genista than to the other species of Cytisus. Also, C. emeriflorus is very similar to Lembotropis nigricans; its inclusion in the genus Lembotropis is sustained. Genista is much more complex; its section Asterospartum should be segregated as the genus Cytisanthus Lang, being internally homogeneous, distinct from all other sections and fairly close to Lygos. A new combination, Cytisanthus aetnensis (Biv.) comb. nova, is published. Genista pilosa and G. anglica seem very much isolated, but the authors do not intend to propose here a new taxonomic rank, due to the scarcity of data. Teline is very similar to Genista. Even more similar to Genista is Chamaespartium sagittale, which biochemically and morphologically fits very well in the subgenus Genista, in spite of its winged stem. In a general arrangement of the tribe, two groups of genera represent the extreme points of diversification: (1) Cytisus-Lembotropis-Calycotome and (2) Genista-Teline-Petteria-Spartium and (with decreasing similarity) Cytisanthus and Lygos. Between these two groups there are a series of intermediate genera, that may be placed in one group or the other depending on the method of analysis: Adenocarpus, Argyrolobium (both of them should be included in the tribe), Cytisus sessilifolius and Laburnum. Ulex and Lupinus are very dissimilar from all other genera.
10.2307/1220195|Computer analyses of data on 41 characters compiled for 158 genera of Caesalpinioideae gave equivocal results at lower hierarchical levels, but pointed to the existence of two major series (Caesalpinieae + Cassieae + Dimorphandreae + most Sclerobieae/Amherstieae + Detarieae + two Sclerobieae), for which diagnoses are provided. The results are more in line with updated versions of Bentham's classification than with Hutchinson's. They are consistent with data on seed amyloid and also with observations on leaf transfer cells.

10.2307/1220547|This paper considers the evolution of genetic mechanisms in the fungi. Specific attention is directed to the nature of the hereditary material (e.g., guanine-cytosine content, genome size, reiterated sequence content). The impact of the small amount of DNA per fungal cell is examined in the context of limiting evolutionary potential. The evolution of complex genetic mechanisms involving functionally related genes is considered from systems known in extant fungi, e.g., genetic isolating mechanisms, mycelial growth rate, time and abundance of fruiting, control of recombination, and patterns of sexuality.
10.2307/1220549|Techniques are presented which involve the utilization of a computer for assembling and manipulating floristic and ecological information concerning Florida's Central-East coast vegetation. Information is included relating to the use of a computer to assist in establishing a herbarium representing a local flora. In addition, ecological, morphological and economic information concerning each taxon was stored in the computer, and programs were developed to sort, retrieve and present this information in a variety of formats. This system was designed around an adaptable and relatively inexpensive program (NLHE) which makes it feasible for small colleges and universities with computing facilities to accumulate, store and retrieve regional floristic and ecological data.
10.2307/1220550|Interpretation of numerical results in analysis of relationships between OTU's or between variables is profitably achieved when the Q or R matrix can be reduced in dimensionality. An approach is proposed, viz. transformation of the elements of the matrix such that the first few eigenvalues much increase relative to others while minimizing distortion of the matrix, for the cases when eigenvalues computed from such a matrix gradually decrease. A numerical example is given using the transformation Yij=X<sub>ij</sub><sup>n</sup>.
10.2307/1220551|Herbarium specimens (375) of species of Nyssa, Camptotheca and Davidia were analyzed for cobalt and nickel. All species of Nyssa (4 from the United States and 2 from Southeast Asia) possessed a marked ability to accumulate cobalt not only in absolute terms but also relative to nickel. The mean cobalt contents of the species were sufficiently different to allow differentiation of many pairs of species. It was concluded that all species of Nyssa could be used for assessing the cobalt status of soils. Camptotheca acuminata showed a much lower uptake of cobalt than Nyssa species but this uptake was still considerably higher than in most other plants and strengthened the case for inclusion of Camptotheca in the Nyssaceae. Davidia involucrata showed no capability for accumulating cobalt to a level exceeding normal background for most vegetation: thus strengthening arguments that it should be excluded from the Nyssaceae.
10.2307/1220553|Eastern cottontail rabbits, Sylvilagus floridanus (Allen), were demonstrated to prefer feeding upon Vernonia flaccidifolia Small which lacks sesquiterpene lactones rather than V. gigantea (Walt.) Trel. ssp. gigantea which contains the bitter sesquiterpene lactone glaucolide-A. The rabbits also essentially avoided V. flaccidifolia coated with a thin layer of glaucolide-A. Whitetail deer, Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmermann), were shown to prefer V. flaccidifolia over V. gigantea as well as V. flaccidifolia coated with glaucolide-A. These experimentally determined feeding preferences supported field observations. Sesquiterpene lactones, in addition to functioning as insect feeding deterrents, also appear to defend Vernonia against browsing mammals. The wide distribution of sesquiterpene lactones in Compositae may be related to coevolution not only with insects but also with mammalian herbivores.
10.2307/1220555|Terminology of the androecium and fruit of the Lecythidaceae are reviewed and illustrated. The uncertainty of earlier workers (Miers, 1874; Knuth, 1939) as to the identity of the generic and familial type, Lecythis ollaria Loefling, is reviewed. The genuine identity of L. ollaria is established and the species is described and illustrated. The genus Lecythis is re-defined and described, and comments on its relationship with Couroupita, Corythophora and Eschweilera are given. The reasons for placing Chytroma pro parte, Holopyxidium, Sapucaya and Pachylecythis in synonomy under Lecythis are discussed. A key to the New World genera of the family is provided.
10.2307/1220556|Numerical taxonomic and classical methods are used to describe a pattern of variation within a cosmopolitan species of epiphytic bromeliad. Two distinct assemblages were recognized and each of their geographic distributions include a wide range of partially interdigitating habitats. The typical subspecies is largely coastal but ranges up the slopes of the andes. The new subspecies is mostly andean. The Massenerhebung or mountain mass effect is considered partly responsible for its distribution on isolated cerros among the hills of the coastal plains and at higher elevations within the western cordillera of the andes.
10.2307/1220557|The American lotus has long been known as Nelumbo lutea (Willd.) Pers. An earlier epithet, derived from Nymphaea pentapetala Walt., was once interpreted by Fernald as applying to the American plant, justifying the new name Nelumbo pentapetala (Walt.) Fern.; this name was soon opposed on the ground that it was based on a monstrosity. Although Fernald's name has not been generally accepted, Sohmer has recently argued that this ground for its rejection is not pertinent. However, a broader consideration of the context in which Walter described his Nymphaea pentapetala, including examination of the other nymphaeoid plants described by him, his probable dependence upon Fraser for part of their collection, and the inadequacy of any present herbarium record, suggests that he may have been describing the Old World sacred lotus, Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn., or a mixture of the sacred lotus and the American lotus, or that his basis, at least in part, was a confused verbal report provided him by Fraser. Nymphaea pentapetala Walt. remains of uncertain application, and nomenclatural stability is best served by the retention of Nelumbo lutea (Willd.) Pers. for the American lotus.
10.2307/1220558|The literature on Ipomoea carnea and I. fistulosa is briefly discussed. Original publications, illustrations, type specimens, distributions, and habitat preferences are reviewed, and the criteria used to separate these two names at the species level are found invalid. Modern interpretation of I. carnea has been based in part on a misconception of the original publication and on a complex population adapted for two habitats. Two subspecies are recognized: I. carnea ssp. carnea Jacq. and I. carnea ssp. fistulosa (Mart. ex Choisy) D. Austin.
10.2307/1220559|Style branches in Eupatorium havanense H.B.K., as they develop, elongate, bow outwards, and either expand in an ascending manner or cross each other. This is consistent with expansion by greater enlargement of the outer surface than of the inner surface of the style branch. As a similar pattern is found in Astereae, style branch exposure may be characteristic at the tribal level.
10.2307/1220560| [French] Une description formelle d'un nouvel ordre de Chrysophyceae distinct des Ochromonadales et des Chromulinales est donne. L'ordre est fond sur le genre-type Sarcinochrysis caractris par des monades  appareil flagellaire latral form de deux fouets htromorphes. Deux sous-ordres (Sarcinochrysidineae et Chrysomeridineae) et deux familles nouvelles (Sarcinochrysidaceae et Nematochrysopsidaceae) sont dfinis; des modifications sont apportes dans la diagnose de deux autres familles et dans celle de genres antrieurement dcrits. /// A formal description is given of a new order of Chrysophyceae distinct from the Ochromonadales and the Chromulinales. The order is based on the type genus Sarcinochrysis featuring monads with lateral heteromorphic flagella. Two new sub-orders (Sarcinochrysidineae and Chrysomeridineae) and two new families (Sarcinochrysidaceae and Nematochrysopsidaceae) are created; the diagnosis of two other families and genera previously described is amplified. 
10.2307/1220562|This paper presents a point of view on the recent proposal, made by Schmid and Stevenson (1976), concerning the creation of a new journal of structural botany. For the author a discussion on this subject implies a more complex problem than just a creation of a new journal, it implies the role of theory in the progress of botany. After a brief survey of the importance of theory in plant morphology, it is concluded that ARBERIA is justified as a journal to research guide lines for botany. It is impossible to carry out morphological research without guide lines. "Hard cold facts" (Hirsch, 1975) do not exist totally independently of any theoretical assumptions.
10.2307/1220563|A new example, purported to exemplify Art. 23, 3 of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature viz. Secretan, C., Mycographie Suisse, 1833 will be inserted in the forthcoming new edition of the Code. We submit that the new example is in flagrant contradiction with the contents of the paragraph (3) and the main part of the article; does not serve any justifiable purpose; confuses rather than clarifies the basic principles of nomenclature; should never have been accepted; should be rescinded at the earliest opportunity.
10.2307/1220573| The history of starting point philosophies for fungi are outlined, and a resum of proposals circulated within Subcommittee D is furnished within the context of discussion. The subjects covered are intended to serve as the basis for discussion at the Second International Mycological Congress, 1977. Under a mandate from the First International Mycological Congress at Exeter, 1972, the International Mycological Association established a Nomenclature Committee, with Dr. R. P. Korf as Secretary. Subsequently, mycologists were offered the opportunity to serve on one or more subcommittees, each to deal with specific nomenclatural problems associated with fungi. One such subcommittee (Subcommittee D) was charged with examining and discussing the subject of starting points for fungi, and with formulating proposals for consideration by the Second International Mycological Congress (Tampa, Aug./Sept., 1977) and for possible adoption by the Special Committee for Fungi and Lichens (of IAPT), and possible inclusion into the ICBN (presumably the "Sydney Code"). For over two years opinions and proposals have been circulated within Subcommittee D, and discussion has been lively. Two facts emerge, however: a) a large number of mycologists still feel unheard and/or uninformed, in spite of efforts to involve as many individuals in the subcommittee structure as possible; and b) the necessary debate scheduled for Tampa will proceed with only the Subcommittee members in possession of all the relevant proposals and opinions -- a regrettable situation. As Secretary to Subcommittee D, and in order to alleviate the stresses outlined above, I have attempted to draft a "primer" for interested mycologists, concerning the subject and the problems and advantages of the major emergent philosophies. It is hoped that this publication can serve as a basis for discussion at Tampa, so that those deliberations may be conducted in orderly fashion, and to constructive ends. 
10.2307/1220574| Historical analysis of the various generic concepts of Micrasterias (Desmidiaceae, Zygnemaphyceae) since its original description by C. Agardh in 1827 leads to the following conclusions: 1) the name Micrasterias of C. Agardh, 1827, is not valid since it was published before the starting point for nomenclature in the Desmidiaceae (Ralfs, 1848); 2) the valid generic name is Micrasterias C. Agardh ex Ralfs non Micrasterias Ktzing; and 3) M. furcata C. Agardh ex Ralfs non M. furcata C. Agardh must be considered the type species for the genus. /// [Portuguese] A anlise histrica dos vrios conceitos genricos de Micrasterias (Desmidiaceae, Zygnemaphyceae), desde sua descrio original por C. Agardh, em 1827, permitiu concluir que: 1) o nome Micrasterias de C. Agardh, 1827, no  vlido, por ter sido publicado anteriormente  data de ponto oficial de partida dos estudos nomenclaturais das Desmidiaceae, o qual  representado pelo trabalho de Ralfs, publicado em 1848; 2) o nome correto do gnero  Micrasterias C.

10.2307/1220578|Previous lectotypifications (of which there have been five) have not taken into account (or in Rydberg's case have misinterpreted) the DeCandollean protologue. Schumann's (1890) choice of Malvastrum wrightii A. Gray as lectotype is inadmissible because this species was not included by DeCandolle. The choice of Malvastrum coccineum (Pursh) A. Gray made by Rydberg (1913) and by others is also unacceptable for the same reason (and for other reasons as well). The lectotypification proposed by Kearney (1947, 1955) is the earliest that is consistent with the DeCandollean protologue, although it did not take it into account and is therefore only accidentally consistent. The choice that we here propose is intended to preserve the sense and intent of Kearney's choice and to conform to Recommendation 7B (Stafleu et al., 1972) "to preserve current usage."
10.2307/1220034|Examination of the secondary xylem, twigs and bark of Pakaraimaea dipterocarpacea indicates that this tree occupies an intermediate position phylogenetically on the basis of structures in the secondary xylem. Comparison with other families indicates some affinity with the Myrtaceae, Lecythidaceae, and Quiinaceae. A much closer relationship is evident with the subfamily Dipterocarpoideae of the Dipterocarpaceae and the Sarcolaenaceae, however these groups are still distinctly separated by critical features. The closest correspondence in anatomical characters lies with the African genera Monotes A. DC and Marquesia Gilg which comprise the subfamily Monotoideae of the Dipterocarpaceae. Secondary xylem with small, solitary, diffuse pores; vessel elements with simple perforations and vestured pitting, intervessel and ray-vessel pitting dissimilar; axial parenchyma unilaterally paratracheal, aliform to confluent, and diffuse-in-aggregates apotracheal, crystalliferous; rays very fine and closely spaced, biseriate to uniseriate, heterocellular in the former, not storied; fibers thick walled with prominent bordered pitting uniformly distributed on radial and tangential walls in uniseriate rows, fibers angled in cross section and in distinct radial rows; resin ducts absent. Pith oval in cross section, solid, with thin walled isodiametric cells, and numerous enlarged mucilage cavities. Resin ducts absent. Bark thin, smooth, dense; prominent sclerenchyma in cortex; periderm sub-epidermal in origins forming thin, flattened scales; phloem parenchyma crystalliferous; phloem fibers in narrow, reticulate lamellations in the older bark.
10.2307/1220037|Taxa of the small genus Anacyclus, centered in N.W. Africa, have very similar karyotypes (2n = 18), but Giemsa C-banding reveals striking differences. Chemosystematic information mainly come from distinct flavonol and diosmetin O-glycosylation patterns. Furthermore, morphological analyses according to the principles of Hennig (1966) are presented in cladogram form. Comparison of results obtained by such different methods is facilitated by similarity diagrams, which show good (but not complete) correspondence of the data-sets. Chromosome C-banding therefore appears to be a powerful new tool for karyosystematics in plants. Potentials for a synthetic systematic treatment of Anacyclus and an evolutionary interpretation of the various data are discussed.
10.2307/1220038|Literature relating to the subfamilies of the Chenopodiaceae was reviewed with the conclusion that two subfamilies, Chenopodioideae and Salsoloideae, should be recognized.
10.2307/1220040|Individuals representing five taxa and numerous unidentified OTU's of red oaks native to the western Great Lakes region of the United States were examined through principal components analysis. Two data sets, one consisting of twenty untransformed characters and one in which various characters were redefined as ratios, were employed for comparative analyses. Although minor differences are noted, the two data sets provide essentially the same view of the relationships between the included OTU's. The five taxa appear to form more or less discrete groups with the unidentified OTU's occupying positions of intermediacy. The results support previous conclusions that extensive hybridization occurs among the red oaks of this geographic region.
10.2307/1220041|The hyperspatial cluster concept of taxa is considered. The number of individuals required to delineate figures in high dimensionalities is shown to be very great. A biological basis for the hyperspherical form is suggested, and a possible reason for the existence of "difficult" taxa is presented.
10.2307/1220046|A computer program which prints herbarium labels has been constructed. Individual labels consist of a maximum of 12 lines, each of 40 spaces. However, labels with varying amounts of information can be printed. A cost analysis indicates that the computer printed labels are approximately half the cost and are of superior or equivalent quality when compared with xerox duplicated or magnetic-card typed labels. This program is available from the authors.
10.2307/1220047|A list of isotypes and syntypes contained in a Texas collection of Lindheimer plants preserved at the National Herbarium of Canada in Ottawa, is presented.
10.2307/1219639|A list of features for preparing a numerical taxonomy of the nanoplankton is presented and includes 387 morphological, ultrastructural, physiological, and biochemical characters. The characters are to be recorded and the taxonomic data are to be analyzed by computer to determine: (i) degree of over-all similarity among the strains, based on the 387 characters; (ii) minimum number and particular characters suitable for construction of an identification key; and (iii) minimum set of characters providing as robust a classification as that developed using all the characters. The approach taken in this study can provide the basis for on-line computer identification of the photosynthetic, aerobic nanoplankton. Results of an analysis of 10 species of Haptophyceae and Chrysophyceae, using morphological and ultrastructural data, demonstrate the practicality of this proposed system. Dendrograms prepared by computer are presented and comparison of the results obtained by computer analysis with classical taxonomic treatment shows good agreement.
10.2307/1219642|The perennial species of Linanthus have been regarded as members of a number of different genera in the Polemoniaceae, the most notable being Leptodactylon, Linanthus, and Linanthastrum. A reexamination of the characters used in taxonomic treatments of this species complex, plus a consideration of new or as yet little considered characters suggests that these species are best included in Linanthus. The genus Linanthastrum is rejected herein based on its original circumscription.
10.2307/1219643|Representatives of Vigna species may be separated into a number of groups on the basis of their seed protein profiles. Since these groups are consistent with contemporary classifications of the species it is suggested that the procedure employed here may be of value in systematic investigations of this genus. The profiles indicate that the different species examined all have the same major seed storage proteins.
10.2307/1219645|The tangle of nomenclature surrounding Roxburgh's "Flora indica" is displayed and the date of publication of the first two volumes of the second edition is shown to be in January 1832. Many Roxburgh names were first validly published by others including Buchanan-Hamilton. Hamilton's overlooked and misinterpreted binomials in Meliaceae and other families in his Commentaries on Rumpf and Rheede and in other papers are reconsidered. This necessitates name changes in Chisocheton (where a new subspecific combination is proposed) and Dysoxylum, both Meliaceae, and in Artocarpus, Garcinia (where a new combination is proposed) and Hygrophila. Later publication of Hamilton MS names by Dillwyn necessitates a new name in Canthium, while three of the 'new' names are antedated by overlooked ones in Dennstedt's interpretation of Rheede, necessitating new combinations in Parsonsia, Scleropyrum and Wrightia. Many names are shown to have been published earlier than is widely supposed, and completely overlooked, validly published binomials in Anacardium, Antidesma, Asclepias, Canthium, Elaeocarpus, Helicteres, Leucas, Pharnaceum, Polypodium and Pterocarpus are listed while Jones's mononomials are considered invalid. Three Hamilton names, two of them legitimately published in Caltha (=? Delphinium spp.) are still of uncertain application. An interpretation of Dennstedt's other validly published names based on Rheede plates is appended, necessitating new combinations in Andrographis, Dalbergia, Ixora and Tetrastigma. Some six legitimate Dennstedt names, in Asclepias (=? Tylophora sp.), Aspidium (=? Dryopteris [s.l.] sp.), Forsythia (= Chionanthus sp.), Limonia (=? Randia sp.), Pothos (=? Embelia sp.) and Uvaria (= Polyalthia sp.) are still of uncertain application.
10.2307/1219646| Sixteen plant specimens collected in Australia by Jacques Julien Houtou de Labillardire, naturalist on the voyage of d'Entrecasteaux, 1791-1794, and eight other Australian specimens possibly collected by Labillardire are listed. Their original names and names in current use are given, with bibliographic citations, data from specimen labels, identification of handwriting on these labels, and locality information from original descriptions. A history of the specimens is given. 
10.2307/1219648|Dried plant material can be prepared for anatomical (or general taxonomic) study by soaking it in a 2% to 5% aqueous solution of Contrad 70 until adequate expansion of the tissue is achieved (this occurring in one to several hours). Advantages of Contrad 70 over Aerosol OT (Ayensu 1967) include: more rapid and effective expansion of tissue, better appearance of sectioned tissue due to removal of slight amounts of obfuscating tannins, and easier microtoming of material due to Contrad's greater softening ability. Contrad has no or very little effect on cutin, starch, crystals, tannins, and secretory compounds.
10.2307/1219649|Three models of plant-press driers are presented briefly. They were developed for greater efficiency, higher quality, inexpensive local manufacture, and use under diverse conditions.
10.2307/1219653|Three proposals on Article 48 are made: (1) to revise the text of the first paragraph, emphasizing explicit exclusion of types, rather than implicit exclusion by circumscription, (2) to transfer the first paragraph to Article 64 and (3) to transfer the second paragraph to Article 14. The principle of requiring explicit, rather than implicit, exclusion of a type leads to the conclusion that Mitracarpus hirtus (L.) DC. is the correct name for the taxon often called M. villosus (Sw.) DC.
10.2307/1219656|Lonchitis aurita L. has proved to be a synonym of Pteris arborea L. Lonchitis hirsuta L. is the type of Lonchitis, and Anisosorus Trev. ex Maxon must be placed in synonymy under it.
10.2307/1219673|The obligate type species of Phialea (Fr. ex Pers.) Gillet, Peziza phiala Vahl. ex Pers., is an apparently untypified and undeterminable species, and has not been included in the genus in any recent treatments. The generic name has been widely and persistently used in several senses, but always excluding its type. Phialea is formally proposed for inclusion in the list of nomina rejicienda to be prepared under the revised (Leningrad) wording of Art. 69.
10.2307/1220473|There are no criteria of scientific value by which Glyptostrobus oregonensis Brown and G. nordenskioldii (Heer) Brown (including G. dakotensis Brown) may be distinguished from G. europaeus (Brongniart) Heer. G. europaeus is a form species of wide geographical and geological range for fossil specimens similar to extant Glyptostrobus pensilis (Lambert) Koch. While it is possible that the fossil form species represents several biological species, specificity has not been proven for any specimen from the North American Tertiary. There is no proof that the Cretaceous Glyptostrobus comoxensis Bell is a Glyptostrobus.
10.2307/1220474|The personal herbarium of John Forbes Royle, who collected plants in the Himalayas, was rediscovered in 1952 as part of a donation to the City of Liverpool Museums. Recent work on the herbarium has shown that these specimens were examined by some of the leading botanists of Royle's period, and that they found new species in the collection, many of which were described and published. This paper reports this recent work and includes a revised list of Type Specimens contained in the herbarium.
10.2307/1220477|The problem of the correct position of the Conocephaloideae, a subfamily of the Moraceae in Engler's system, but transferred to the Urticaceae by Corner (1962), can be satisfactorily solved by assigning the rank of family to this taxon, to be named Cecropiaceae. Diagnoses of and a key to the six genera constituting this family (Cecropia, Coussapoa, Musanga, Myrianthus, Poikilospermum, and Pourouma) are given. The classification of the Urticales and the relationship between the Cecropiaceae and both Moraceae and Urticaceae are discussed. A key to the families of the Urticales is given.
10.2307/1220483|A selective, yet comprehensive bibliography of plant collecting techniques, preservation methods, herbarium procedures and practices, administrative problems, and the herbarium's role as a repository of preserved specimens.
10.2307/1220513| The publication in October, 1873, of "Polystichum pyrenaicum Migeville" in an obscure journal [Revue catholique du diocse de Tarbes No 41: 764] predates the binomial Dryopteris oreades Fomin proposed for the taxon previously known as Dryopteris abbreviata (DC.) Newm. (Fraser-Jenkins & Jermy, 1976). However Migeville states that he uses Polystichum pyrenaicum as a "nom provisoire", and after examination of his earlier papers which explain what he meant by this term, we conclude that Migeville, was not prepared to draw any conclusion regarding the rank of his "species" and did not thereby accept his own nomenclature. Thus Migeville's names, being not accepted at species rank by the author, are not valid according to Article 34, provision 1, of the ICBN (Stafleu et al., 1972) and the name Dryopteris oreades still stands. Two additions and one deletion are made to the synonymy of D. oreades as given in Fraser-Jenkins & Jermy (1976); the latter being Aspidium distans Viviani, which in fact refers to D. pseudomas (Woll.) Holub & Pouzar as shown by Pichi-Sermolli (1960). 
10.2307/1220235|The pollination, hybridization and ethological isolation of sympatric and synchronously flowering annuals Rhinanthus minor and R. serotinus were studied. Pollination was achieved by nototribically and sternotribically pollinating bumblebees (Bombus spp.), i.e. the essential parts of the flower contacts the dorsal respectively the ventral side of the insect's body. In general, pollination behaviour was related to tongue lengths of bumblebee species. Bumblebees could bring about species hybridization by visits to both plants species during one foraging trip as nototribic or as sternotribic pollinators and species isolation by visits to only one species during one foraging trip or by visits to one species nototribically and to the other sternotribically during one foraging trip. Hybridization between the two annual Rhinanthus species resulted in the rise of hybrid swarms. Partial isolation could be effected if medium-tongued or short-tongued bumblebee species visited both plant species during one foraging trip; in that case the stigma of R. minor is not able to touch the sites of R. serotinus pollen on the bodies of the bumblebees, but the reverse may be possible. The inaccessibility of the R. minor stigma resulted in R. minor remaining relatively 'pure'. By analyzing the foraging patterns of bumblebees on Rhinanthus during three successive days the significance of two different forms of ethological isolation is considered. About 40% of the observed bumblebees confined their visits to one Rhinanthus species. The long-tongued B. hortorum showed a strong preference for R. serotinus. The behaviour patterns of 60% brought about partial isolation or hybridization. The medium-tongued B. pascuorum was responsible for partial isolation (isolation of R. minor). The short-tongued species B. pratorum, B. terrestris and B. lapidarius were 'good' hybridizers. To support the idea that introgression into R. serotinus was likely, some other factors are discussed, e.g. the attractiveness of R. serotinus, and the fact that bumblebees are more likely to alternate between R. serotinus and the hybrid forms.
10.2307/1220236|Serological techniques have been employed in a systematic investigation of selected taxa of the Rubiaceae and selected putative relatives. Mature seed proteins were compared by quantitative and qualitative serological methods. Presaturation techniques were combined with the Ouchterlony tests to obtain additional data. An antiserum was presaturated and used in double diffusion tests to react against selected cross antigens. The combination of presaturation tests with double diffusion provided valuable information about the distribution of determinant groups. Various taxa belonging to 14 genera of Rubiaceae were reacted with taxa of the Apocynaceae, Asclepiadaceae, Caprifoliaceae, Cornaceae, Dipsacaceae, Gentianaceae, Nyssaceae and Umbelliferae. Quantitative data emphasized the similarity of the Rubiaceae to the Cornaceae and Caprifoliaceae. Presaturation tests using Rubiaceae antiserum revealed that the immunoprecipitating systems obtained with Apocynaceae, Asclepiadaceae and Gentianaceae were very similar to those systems obtained with the Cornaceae. Presaturation tests made it possible to determine that one or two systems were common to the five above families, and this has been interpreted as evolutionary similarity. Asperula and Galium were found to be serologically similar to each other, while being the two most dissimilar genera when compared with all other Rubiaceae genera.
10.2307/1220238|Botanical nomenclature exists to serve botanical classification: horticultural nomenclature exists to serve horticultural selection. Hence the wisdom of having two Codes and the importance of keeping these two separate matters distinct at all levels. Botanical nomenclature is obligately classificatory. In contrast, horticultural nomenclature does not arise unless and until a cultivar has been created by selection from amongst other material within (actually or conceptually) the same botanical taxon. A cultivar, whether consisting of one clone or a thousand clones is a single, recognisable entity. No objection can be raised to a botanical combination, if correctly proposed, being based upon a pre-1st January 1959 Latin-form cultivar name. Many such combinations, however, were not in the past correctly proposed. A Latin-form trinomial name given to a cultivar is not a validly published combination (Article 33). A cultivar, by definition, is not a taxon (Articles 1-4), so reference to the description of a cultivar does not satisfy the requirements of Article 32. A proposed combination based solely on the description of a cultivar (the describing author's intention here is paramount) is therefore not validly published and must be rejected.
10.2307/1220263|The committee recommends conservation as proposed of Dietes Salisb. ex Klatt, Desmodium Desvaux, Gentianella Moench, Ipomoea L., Oplismenus Beauvois, Chomelia Jacquin, Phragmipedium Rolfe, Sansevieria Thunberg and Echinochloa Beaucois; finds that conservation as proposed is unnecessary for Oryctanthus (Griseb.) Eichler, Dichosciadium Domin, Lepistemon Blume and Leptochloa Beauvois; rejects present proposals but invites new proposals for Ptychotis Koch, Relbania L'Heritier and Eurotia Adanson; and rejects completely proposals for conservation of Hippomarathrum Link, Phthirusa Eichler and Lophochloa Reichenbach.
10.2307/1220264| Aneilema was described by Brown in 1810 but was considered synonymous with Commelina by most workers until Kunth recognized it in 1843. From 1843 to 1881 numerous genera were segregated from it. In 1881 all of these segregates were placed in synonymy under Aneilema by Clarke. The concept of the genus remained virtually unchanged until Brckner divided it into Aneilema s. str. and Phaeneilema (= Murdannia) in 1926. Brckner's circumscriptions of these genera have been used by most later workers. Brown's Aneilema contained elements of three genera, Aneilema s. str., Murdannia and Pollia. Brckner's typification of Aneilema by A. biflorum was nomenclaturally incorrect and historically unjustified. Retypification is rejected because of the confusion it would produce, and because it is not necessary. The genus Aneilema as circumscribed by Brown (1810) included species currently recognized as belonging to three genera, Aneilema s. str., Murdannia and Pollia. Collectively these genera comprise about 120 species, or more than one-sixth of the total in the family. Typification of Aneilema is therefore of great nomenclatural significance. In the present paper a review of more than a century of botanical literature since Brown's description of Aneilema clearly suggests that the genus should logically have been typified by A. gramineum R. Br. or A. giganteum (Vahl) R. Br. Brckner (1926), however, selected A. biflorum R. Br. as lectotype, thus restricting the genus to a sense in which it had never previously been used. Retypification is rejected because it would severely dislocate the now well established concepts of Aneilema and Murdannia and, strictly speaking, it is not necessary. 
10.2307/1220267| The genus Arthrochloa Lorch, on grounds of homonymy, is renamed Normanboria Butzin. The genus Pleioneura Phipps, on grounds of priority, must bear the name Rattraya Phipps; the names of three species and a section are newly combined. Unter den in letzter Zeit neu aufgestellten Gramineengattungen befinden sich zwei, deren Namen aufgrund der Vorschriften des International Code of Botanical Nomenclature gendert werden mssen: Arthrochloa und Pleioneura. Eine Gramineengattung Arthrochloa wurde mit sehr kurzer Diagnose erstmals von Schultes (1827) verffentlicht. Sie wurde seitdem als Synonym von Holcus angesehen, wodurch der Name Arthrochloa unbeachter blieb. So hatte Lorch (1960) keine Kenntnis von diesem Namen, als er von Dactyloctenium eine strker abweichende Art abtrennte und ihr den Gattungsnamen Arthrochloa gab. Diese Gattung hat verwandtschaftlich nichts mit der alten zu tun, beide sind Homonyma. Fr Arthrochloa Lorch ist daher gemss Art. 64 des ICBN ein neuer Gattungsname zu bilden. Um einen berhmten Agrostologen aus Kew, Norman Loftus Bor (1893-1972), zu ehren, nenne ich die Gattung jetzt Normanboria. 
10.2307/1220276| The type specimen of Alternanthera ficoidea (Linn) Beauv. (Amaranthaceae) is present in the Van Royen Herbarium, Leyden; it belongs to the taxon known as A. paronychioides St. Hil. In accordance with Article 69 of the Code it is proposed to reject the former name in favour of A. tenella Colla, which is the oldest name for the taxon as it is generally known. A new combination for a subspecies is proposed in collaboration with J. A. Mears, as well as one for a variety. 
10.2307/1220367|Phylogenetic systematics in the sense of W. Hennig has exerted a great influence on systematic zoology. Among botanists, however, it has been overlooked and the present paper is intended as a brief summary of the principles, results, and advantages of its application in botanical systematics. In phylogenetic reconstruction monophyletic groups are established by the use of the unique, derived features inherited by the members from the immediate ancestor of the group. Since species splitting has been mainly dichotomous, the search for sister species or sister groups is the main procedure in phylogenetic reconstruction. The effects of multiple splitting of species, parallelism, and reticulate evolution are also discussed. In traditional, "natural" or "evolutionary" classification the degree of similarity is a main criterion for relationship. Since similarity depends on both primitive and derived characters, the groups established will often be paraphyletic; some of the descendants of the common ancestor will not be included in such a group. Paraphyletic groups have no reality in nature and their use in evolutionary and biogeographic discussion is a major obstacle to progress. In a strictly phylogenetic classification all taxa must be monophyletic and all sister groups given equal rank. If these principles are followed, the classification will reflect nature's own hierarchy and its groups will be directly useful in all branches of causal biology. The effects of phylogenetic classification on different levels are demonstrated by two examples. Takhtajan's angiosperm system is discussed and it is shown that the traditional division of the angiosperms into the two classes Magnoliatae (dicotyledons) and Liliatae (monocotyledons) will have to be abandoned, since Magnoliatae is paraphyletic. On the genus level it is shown that if one wishes to maintain a number of specialized genera within the Capparidaceae-Cleomoideae, the genus Cleome becomes paraphyletic. As long as the phylogeny of the whole group is not worked out, the only solution is to include the specialized segregates within the genus Cleome. Similar examples could be found anywhere in contemporary botanical classification.
10.2307/1220369|The family Ulmaceae is most often treated as a single family with two subfamilies: The Ulmeae (Ulmoideae) and Celteae (Celtidoideae) or, more recently, as two separate families: the Ulmaceae and the Celtidaceae (sensu Grudzinskaya). A flavonoid survey of 80 species of Ulmaceae shows that each of the 19 genera is characterized by the production of flavonols (Ulmoid) or glycoflavones (Celtoid), but not both. Further, the arrangement of genera based on this flavonoid dichotomy is remarkably compatible with the generic assignments in Grudzinskaya's bifamilial concept of the Ulmaceae. The only exceptions are Ampelocera, Aphananthe, and Gironniera (in part), which are normally considered Celtoid but possess Ulmoid (flavonols) chemistry. However, recent anatomical and morphological studies of these three genera indicate that their relationship to the Celtoid line may not be as direct as has been supposed, a point also suggested by the flavonoid chemistry.
10.2307/1220373|Baum (1977) suggests that improved ordinations may be found by first powering the dissimilarity matrix. Although transformations of dissimilarity are always worth considering, this note shows that improvements in fit can be misleadingly optimistic when the powering method is used.
10.2307/1220377|The differences between maize and annual teosinte are so numerous that individuals of the two species are never confused, and hybrids and backcrosses are easily distinguished. Mexican and Central American teosintes are similar, but differences in the male and female inflorescences, as well as cytogenetic and geographical separation, allow them to be delimited as two species of Zea Linnaeus (1753) (Gramineae).
10.2307/1220378|Legitimacy of a synonym is one of three considerations entering into the determination of the correct name of a species, the others being priority and availability of the epithet in the generic name accepted. Epithets validly published in illegitimate binomials do not enter into considerations of priority. However, if such an epithet is later used under another generic name, it may form a legitimate binomial (Article 72, Note) and must be treated as a new name with priority dating from the time of legitimate usage. This causes shifts in priority, as well as author citation, particularly if the epithet is transferred to a third generic name (Article 33, Note 2), considerations sometimes overlooked in current literature. The reinstatement of the formerly well-known name, Desmodium incanum DC. (1825), and rejection of the currently well-known name, D. canum Schinz & Thellung (1913), is a case in point.
10.2307/1220379| Allium triquetrum L. (1753) has been typified (de Wilde-Duyfjes 1973) by a specimen collected by Clas Alstrmer in Spain in 1760. This specimen was available to Linnaeus in 1760 or 1761 and is thus unsuitable for typification purposes. Instead, the illustration in Parkinson's "Paradisus terrestris" (1629) would be suitable as the lectotype.

He shows that with high polyploids, it is sometimes very difficult to know if the zygotic number is or is not constant in a population. He thinks that the intraspecific variation by polyploidy or dysploidy often precedes the interspecific variation and he shows how careful one must be in the establishment of the basic number of a studied group. 
10.2307/1219894|Developments in EDP-IR within herbaria are briefly reviewed and progress with implementation of a data banking system by the National Herbarium of the Botanical Research Institute, Pretoria (PRE) is outlined. The three linked bases of the bank (literature, taxonomic information and specimen bases) are described. The numbering systems used for genera, based on that of de Dalla Torre & Harms, as well as those for species and families are described. Procedures which were used for encoding the 500 000 extant Southern African herbarium specimens in PRE as well as methods being used for accessioning new collections are outlined. Both a prototype query system (in operation) and a production query system (nearing completion) are described. Progress to date is discussed and ways in which encoding errors were obviated are highlighted.
10.2307/1219896|Preparation of a Barley Register: An Information Retrieval System for Cultivars. B. K. Thompson and B. R. Baum. Engineering & Statistical Research Institute and Biosystematics Research, Research Branch, Agriculture Canada, Ottawa, Ontario K1A OC6. An information storage and retrieval system has been developed which produces a register for barley (Hordeum) cultivars, including pedigree charts, coefficients of parentage and inbreeding, references, and synonyms and translations for each cultivar. The register also includes cross-references and a general bibliography. Although the system is being applied specifically to barley, it is sufficiently general for use with other cultivated crops. The system is an expanded version of an earlier one developed by the same authors for oat (Avena) cultivars. It is described herein with particular emphasis given to modifications and additions to the previous system.
10.2307/1219898|It is suggested that the use of annotated dots on plant distribution maps can provide more accurate information concerning species status in a flora.
10.2307/1219899| The Atlas of Distribution of Vascular Plants in Poland (ATPOL) is a new project in floristic cartography in eastern central Europe being realized by the cartogram method. The basic map unit is a square 10km  10km. The whole of the Polish vascular flora (about 2400 taxa) is being included. The data are being gathered and processed using electronic data processing (EDP). The concept of ATPOL was proposed by J. Korna in 1966 as a continuation and extension of the already well advanced local cartographic projects which cover various physiographic, historic or administrative regions of Poland (e.g. the Carpathians, the Silesia, the former Lublin voivodship in central-eastern Poland, etc.), as well as some taxonomic or ecological plant groups (e.g. the trees and shrubs, Browicz, 1963-1976). 
10.2307/1219901|An herbarium of Australian plants, compiled by Heward from Cunningham specimens and preserved at the Chelsea Physic Garden, refers to Cunningham's paper on the Blue Mountains Flora (1825). Overlooked binomials for Australian plants from this and other publications are listed and other herbaria at Chelsea described.
10.2307/1219908|Palaeobotanists and palaeopalynologists are faced with increasingly time-consuming difficulties and partial failures when continuing to handle their data for palaeobiologic or for stratigraphic purposes in the traditional manner required by the nomenclature framework of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN). The ICBN was developed for normal (Recent) data on living plants, but the entirely different nature and attributes of fossil data call for separate specially designed arrangements. A proposal is therefore made here for a new appendix to ICBN setting out the distinctions and providing more flexible rules (articles) for nomenclature and thus for the taxonomy of fossils of any size, scope, or preservation. The logical needs for nomenclature and data-handling of plant fossils are very much simpler than the sum of the seventy-five articles of the ICBN; the same can be said equally for fossil animals. Although ultimately a separate Code may be necessary, an appendix which is compatible with the main code and which can be developed independently appears to be the most useful present advance.
10.2307/1219910|The validly published generic name Catunaregam Wolf (1776) based upon Rheede's "Katou-Naregam" has been overlooked or ignored until Ross (1966) called attention to it. Having priority and being congeneric with Xeromphis Raf. (1838), it is here re-established for a group of rubiaceous plants hitherto ascribed to that latter genus. New combinations for two Asiatic and one African species are given. Extensive preliminary work on the tribe Gardenieae (Rubiaceae) suggests deferring disposition of four other species commonly included in Xeromphis until further study can be completed.
10.2307/1219934|A chronological list of the dates in the ICBN is given. A list indicating which dates pertain to the main taxonomic groups is added.
10.2307/1219548|Presently forty-five specific names attached to the genus Clusia are attributable to Central America, ranging from tropical Mexico to Panama below the Panama Isthmus (thus, there geographically of South America). Fourteen such names appear to have been applied to Mexico.
10.2307/1219551|Large differences in the sizes of floral parts producing discontinuities between different individuals or between different populations of the same or closely related taxa require different taxonomic interpretations. Autopolyploidy may produce such discontinuities as in Thelypodiopsis linearifolia (Gray) Al-Shehbaz of southern Arizona, but the single individual with large flowers cannot be considered to be another taxon. A different situation was found in populations differing from Pennellia longifolia by a large jump in the size of floral parts. In this case, there were populations of plants which were not polyploid with respect to P. longifolia and the large size differences were consistent throughout the populations. These populations are recognized as a new species which is named in honor of Dr. Rogers McVaugh who first collected it in the Sierra Madre Occidental of Durango, Mexico.
10.2307/1219552|I. G. Voznesenskii, preparator in the Zoological Museum of the Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg, made extensive botanical collections on the Gulf of California side of Baja California during the winter of 1841-1842. He reached the area aboard the ship "Naslednik Alexandr", which was sent from Sitka, Alaska, to obtain a three years' supply of salt from the natural deposit on Carmen Island, Gulf of California.
10.2307/1219557|The summit flora of the table mountains of Venezuela would appear to be represented by a relatively small endemic generic element with an intermixture of nonendemic generic elements, originating and immigrating centripetally at different times and from different dispersals or origins (West Gondwanaland-American, Australasian/Malaysian-American, Australasia-Antarctica-American), the whole modified by evolution and differentiation on newly available areas of the table mountains during their erosional history and derivation from lowland peripheral sources during Pleistocene and post-Pleistocene times.
10.2307/1219559|Linnaean species of Palmae were mostly based on the literature. Type specimens or illustrations are indicated for Chamaerops humilis and Corypha thebaica. Previous lectotypifications of Calamus rotang and Elate sylvestris are noted and lectotypes are designated for Borassus flabellifer, Corypha umbraculifera, Cocos nucifera, Phoenix dactylifera, Areca catechu and Caryota urens.
10.2307/1219560|Three hybrid swarms of H. divaricatus, a species generally of open or semi-open habitats, and H. microcephalus, a species generally found in shaded areas, were studied in 1950, 1961, and 1972. In one population considerable hybridity was still evident in 1972, probably the result of continued disturbance in the area. Although the habitat has become more closed in the other two sites, H. divaricatus-like plants were dominant in one and the sole representatives at the other in 1972. These results may be partly explained by H. divaricatus being the more abundant species in these two localities in 1950 and by its greater life span. That H. divaricatus may owe its increased shade tolerance to introgression from H. microcephalus is also suggested as a possibility.
10.2307/1219564|The great importance of G. Andrieux's botanical collections, not so much by their number, but by the period and area they cover, is discussed. The numerical sequence of the collections is explained and the itinerary shown and illustrated by a map. An index to localities is included with original notes from the label data providing exact geographical location.
10.2307/1219565| [Spanish] Se ensaya una sntesis de los conocimientos actuales acerca de las plantas pertenecientes al gnero Bursera, que agrupa alrededor de un centenar de especies de rboles (o a veces arbustos) caducifolios, distribuidos mayormente en la regin intertropical americana, concentrndose sobre todo en la vertiente pacfica de Mxico. Se pasa revista a sus rasgos morfolgicos ms sobresalientes as como a sus afinidades ecolgicas. En esta discusin se destacan: a) el carcter exfoliante de la corteza de numerosas especies de Bursera, con miras a la interpretacin del significado adaptativo de tal propiedad; b) los diferentes tipos de mesocarpio ariliforme que se presentan en el gnero y la probable funcin de este rgano en la dispersin de las especies; c) dos tipos de hojas cotiledonares que se encontraron al revisar 29 especies de Bursera del Estado de Guerrero con respecto a este carcter. Sobre la base de lo anterior, se trata de interpretar las tendencias evolutivas en el gnero en cuanto a: 1.--hbito de la planta, 2.--caractersticas de la corteza, 3.--tipo de hoja, 4.--caractersticas del mesocarpio, 5.--afinidades ambientales. Se toca asimismo el aspecto taxonmico y el problema de las relaciones de Bursera con Boswellia y Commiphora, gneros, al parecer, estrechamente emparentados. Se propone un esquema hipottico del curso de la filogenia, en el cual se contempla la posibilidad de considerar a Bursera como un conjunto difiltico. /// This contribution attempts a synthesis of the present knowledge of the plants belonging to the genus Bursera, a group of ca. 100 species of deciduous trees (or sometimes shrubs), mainly distributed in American tropics and largely concentrated in the Pacific slopes of Mexico. The most outstanding morphological features of these plants are examined as well as their ecological affinities. In this discussion special emphasis is given to: a) the exfoliating bark of many species of Bursera, with the aim of interpreting its adaptive significance; b) different types of aril-like mesocarp occuring in the genus and its probable role in the dispersal of the plants; c) two different types of cotyledonary leaves found as the result of an examination for this purpose of 29 species of Bursera in the Mexican state of Guerrero. On the basis of this discussion an interpretation of the evolutionary trends in the genus is essayed, with reference to: 1.--habit of the plant, 2.--bark characters, 3.--leaf-type, 4.--mesocarp characters, 5.--ecological affinities. The taxonomic aspect is also approached as well as the relationships of Bursera with allied genera: Boswellia and Commiphora. A hypothetical scheme of the possible course of phylogeny is proposed, in which Bursera as a diphyletic assemblage is conjectured. 
10.2307/1219566|The history of study and nomenclature of stomatal concepts has not yet led to full elucidation of cell pattern significance for higher plants. In this paper, a new ontogenetic system of classification is introduced that makes primary subdivision on the basis of the mode of division of the guard mother cell (GMC) with respect to the wall which cuts it from the meristemoid: diameristic, at right angles; parameristic, parallel to; and anomomeristic, without special orientation to the preceding wall. These are further subdivided on the basis of ontogeny and number of the surrounding cells. The biology of stomata is discussed as it relates to cell patterning, and fundamental ties are pointed out between stomatal configurations and epidermal ontogeny, especially with regard to whether development is rectate, proceeding in a wave from an intercalary or marginal meristem, or diffuse, proceeding with continued meristematic activity within the expanding tissue over a long period of time. The concept of perigenous stomata, those in which protodermal cells act directly as GMC's without prior division, is refuted. The primitive stoma of land plant sporophytes is interpreted to be the simplest type of diameristic, mesoperigenous stoma, in which a protodermal meristemoid divides transversely, cutting off a distal GMC which then divides longitudinally to produce the guard cells. This stoma is suggested as the progenitor type for the Angiospermae, and is the primitive type for at least the Monocotyledonae.
10.2307/1219567|A review of the genus Rhagadiolus indicates that the two species Rhagadiolus edulis Gaertner and R. stellatus (L.) Gaertner have been widely misunderstood and should be maintained as distinct. It is also demonstrated that Rhagadiolus Scop. (1754) and Rhagadiolus A.-L. Jussieu (1789) are taxonomically distinct, and that the generic name must be conserved if it is to continue to be used in its current sense.
10.2307/1219568|In a project organised by the Association pour l'Etude Taxonomique de la Flore d'Afrique Tropicale a register of type specimens of Ranunculaceae from tropical and southern Africa has been produced by assembling photographs of relevant specimens from 30 herbaria. Each photograph is documented by two names, that of the taxon under which the specimen is filed in the herbarium holding it and (where known) that of which the specimen is the type. Additional data can be read from the photographs themselves when necessary. In herbaria where types are already clearly distinguished the method proved relatively quick and involved minimal effort by curators, and the end product was found to answer most of the problems faced by botanists wishing to locate types. No follow-up attempt to systematically go through herbaria recording type in this way is at present envisaged, but those working on plants of tropical and southern Africa are invited to submit any photographs of type specimens from this area to the AETFAT Library in Brussels where a photographic type register will be built up slowly.
10.2307/1219570|All 12 of the taxa in Sedum section Gormania are geographically restricted to western North America, occurring on a variety of rock outcrops that range in elevation from 55 to nearly 3700 meters. Evolutionary divergence of the taxa has been facilitated by temporal isolation of the flowering periods, cytological differentiation, and changes in the breeding systems. Species adaptation and restriction to particular substrates that are isolated in the geologically diverse Klamath region appear to have fostered narrow endemism of some of the taxa. Four of the taxa are putative relicts and are characterized as diploids, morphologically homogeneous, highly self-compatible, and narrowly restricted at low elevations to a single type of substrate. Vegetative reproduction in the relictual taxa is much less than that in related taxa. Those taxa that appear to be more recently evolved have at least two of the following features: tetraploidy or hexaploidy, morphological heterogeneity, extensive vegetative reproduction, low level of self-compatibility, occurrence on geologically recent substrates, or a wide distribution.
10.2307/1219572|A statistical analysis of variation in Clethra occidentalis sensu lato was undertaken to re-examine its limits. Methods used are t-tests and principal component analysis. From the evidence presented, C. occidentalis is redefined to include only Jamaican populations. It is suggested that C. hondurensis be recognized and that the disposition of other Mexican and Central American populations cannot be resolved without further revisionary study of the entire C. occidentalis complex.
10.2307/1219574| The wide-ranging, native North American species Ammannia  coccinea Rottboell (Lythraceae) is determined, on the basis of morphological and cytological evidence, to be an amphidiploid derivative (n = 33) of A. auriculata Willdenow (n = 16) and A. robusta Heer & Regel (n = 17). The latter species has not been recognized in modern floras but its specific status is supported by a unique combination of floral and vegetative characters and distinctive chromosome number. Artificial backcrosses produced vigorous, but pollen-sterile F<sub>1</sub>'s confirming the suggested relationship of the species. Geographical distribution of the complex is presented. 
10.2307/1219575|The genus Melampodium contains 37 species which are distributed throughout Mexico and Central America. Although several evolutionary studies already have been completed on the genus, none has synthesized detailed morphological relationships. A cladistic technique combining features of that of Whiffin and Bierner (1972) and Wagner (1961) is used to construct cladograms. To determine primitive states of 18 qualitative and quantitative characters, four assumptions have been used. A primitive character state: (1) is found in a majority of phenetic groups within the genus (a modification of the "common is primitive" criterion); (2) is found also in the related genus Acanthospermum (out-group comparison); (3) represents a beginning condition of an evolutionary trend that has occurred frequently in parallel within the Compositae; and (4) is a common morphological condition for the family in which the contrasting state is very atypical and obviously derived. The cladograms indicate that numerous parallelisms in the evolution of morphological features have occurred in Melampodium. These trends correspond well with the known chromosomal lines of x = 9, 10, 11, and 12. Distributional data also reflect a pattern of parallel evolutionary development. Taxa of Melampodium are regarded as advanced distributionally if they: (1) are weedy (being defined as having the broadest distributions); (2) are found on the periphery of the range of the genus; and (3) are found in recently derived habitats, chiefly deserts. Species advanced on distributional grounds are found in all four of the chromosomal lines of the genus. Based on all data, section Melampodium (x = 10) is regarded as most primitive within the genus. Considerable evolutionary development also has occurred within this evolutionary line, however, leading to the highly advanced white-rayed complex (series Leucantha).

10.2307/1219578|The literature on the unique pollen-collecting hairs of Campanula (Campanulaceae) is reviewed as background for new pollination studies, with particular reference to the nature and function of the collecting-hair mechanism in the breeding system. The main features of the floral mechanism, including the pronounced dichogamy (protandry) and insect adaptation, were first described and depicted accurately by Sprengel in 1793, although pollination observations date back at least to Linnaeus in 1738. Numerous other workers have since added details but little that is basically new to our knowledge of the floral mechanism. Brief reference is made to some of the significant contributions to cytology, cytogenetics, and pollen morphology in recent years. Campanula is basically allogamous, although cases of limited autogamy are known. Experimental studies have shown that campanulas range from complete self-sterility to complete self-compatibility, but self-fertilization usually is accomplished only with difficulty under experimental conditions, and there is little evidence of spontaneous self-pollination in nature. The pollen is presented from the hairs on the style, which collect the pollen from the anthers while in the bud. The hairs have been known since 1839 to possess the unusual capacity to retract into the style, but the adaptive significance of this mechanism has yet to be explained satisfactorily. The collecting hairs, since before they were known to invaginate, have been interpreted by some investigators as part of a mechanism either to effect fertilization directly through the style without the stigmas or as a back-up to insure autogamy when cross-pollination breaks down. Although little evidence exists to support either view, there is still no definitive explanation of their function in the breeding system. Among campanulaceous families, the genera of the Campanulaceae s.str. are believed to have the least advanced ("naked") form of stylar pollen presentation.
10.2307/1219580|Two similar species of the Stellulatae group of Carex, Carex elachycarpa and C. josselynii were considered to be endemic to the state of Maine in northern New England. Their collection history, nomenclature and unusual morphology are reviewed. Carex elachycarpa was formerly placed in the genus Kobresia due to its possession of a split perigynium. This placement is shown to be untenable on morphological grounds. Close examination showed that both these taxa are aberrant forms of other species. Carex elachycarpa was found to be more or less dioecious with long anthers and is referred to the synonymy of C. sterilis with which it shares these features. Carex josselynii was placed with the synonymy of C. echinata because of its long beak and narrow perigynia. The wider occurrence in Carex of abnormalities found in these taxa such as split perigynia is noted.
10.2307/1219581| The genera Deschampsia and Trisetum were found to be clearly distinct with respect to 13 characteristics of the lemmas, caryopses, lodicules, ligules, basal culm branching and chromosome number. Of these, the type of endosperm and lodicule morphology were found to be the most reliable. Comparison of Deschampsia mexicana, D. pringlei, and Peyritschia koelerioides with these two genera on the basis of the 13 characters showed that all three are closely related to Trisetum. The application of McVaugh's criteria for segregate genera resulted in the retention of Peyritschia as distinct from Trisetum, but with the addition of the former Deschampsia pringlei. Deschampsia mexicana was transferred to Trisetum. New names: Peyritschia pringlei (Scribn.) S. D. Koch; Trisetum mexicanum (Swallen) S. D. Koch. /// [Spanish] Se encontr que los gneros Trisetum y Deschampsia son muy diferentes, tomando como base a 13 caractersticas encontradas en las lemas, cariopses, lodculos, lgulas, ramificacin de la parte basal de los culmos y nmero de cromosomas. Entre stas, se encontr que el tipo de endosperma y la morfologa de las lodculas son las mas confiables. Se utiliz estos 13 carcteres para comparar Deschampsia mexicana, D. pringlei, y Peyritschia koelerioides con las especies tipicas de aquellos dos gneros. Se concluy que las tres estn muy relacionadas con Trisetum. Como resultado de la aplicacin de los criterios de McVaugh para gneros segregados, qued el gnero Peyritschia separado de Trisetum, pero con la adicin de Deschampsia pringlei.

10.2307/1219736| The volatile oils of the leaves of alpine fir were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. In the Pacific Northwest, alpine fir separates into two types, Coastal and Rocky Mountain. They were distinguished by quantitative differences in santene, tricyclene, camphene, -pinene, myrcene, -phellandrene, borneol, and bornyl acetate. Coastal populations had red colors in the periderm, whereas the Rocky Mountain populations had only brown colors. A literature search revealed additional differences between these populations which were originally described as Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt. and A. bifolia Murray, respectively, and more recently as only A. lasiocarpa or as a single variety of A. balsamea. However, our evidence suggests that the original designations more accurately describe these two populations, which have hybridized extensively. 
10.2307/1219738|The method of Character Compatibility, using both morphological and chemical characters, was employed to develop a phylogeny for several closely related diploid species of Chenopodium occurring in the western United States. The species include C. atrovirens, C. desiccatum, C. fremontii, C. hians, C. incanum (including two varieties in addition to the typical one), C. leptophyllum, and C. pratericola. The three similar phylogenies produced by using Character Compatibility were then compared to an hypothesis of phyletic relationships derived intuitively. The intuitive phylogeny in general agrees with those developed by Character Compatibility. Chenopodium fremontii is regarded as having the greatest number of primitive characters and thus is considered to be least modified from the hypothetical ancestral type. Two lines occur from this hypothetical ancestor, one which includes C. incanum and C. desiccatum and the other which contains the remaining four species. The intuitive phylogeny differs in one significant respect, namely, that C. desiccatum is viewed as more closely allied to C. pratericola than to C. incanum. The reason for this is that in the intuitive phylogeny leaf shape is employed as a primary character for producing the two basic phyletic lines. Character Compatibility used a greater number of compatible features for generating the phylogenies (eight as opposed to six in the intuitive phylogeny) but it did not use leaf shape in constructing the trees. It is suggested that several characters placing C. desiccatum and C. incanum together in the trees produced by Character Compatibility may be due to parallel evolution, and not the result of a direct phyletic relationship.
10.2307/1219739|Starch gel electrophoresis has been employed to produce allozyme profiles of 966 individual plants representing twelve morphologically defined domestic and wild taxa of Capsicum. A total of 63 alleles representing 23 enzyme loci has been recognized. These alleles were used as characters in numerical taxonomic analyses, by way of cluster analysis and principal coordinates analysis, of patterns of variation within and between these taxa. The results demonstrate that in some cases there is good agreement between morphological and allozymic patterns of variation while in other cases there is little such agreement. The major groups of taxa, i.e., the white-flowered and purple-flowered groups, are easily discernible but there are problems within these groups. For example, C. pubescens is easily separable from C. cardenasii and C. eximium yet the latter two are indistinguishable. The same pattern is noted, although not so clearly, in the C. baccatum-C. praetermissum complex. Whereas these two taxa can be separated, the two varieties (baccatum and pendulum) of C. baccatum cannot. Additionally, there is complete overlap among the members of what may be called the C. annuum complex, i.e., C. annuum v. annuum, C. a. v. aviculare, C. chinense, and C. frutescens. Finally, the inclusion of two other wild taxa, C. chacoense and C. tovari, permits speculation on the systematic relationships between these taxa and the other wild and domestic taxa.

10.2307/1219741|When names are given to dispersed fossil pollen and spores from the Tertiary, fundamental questions are raised concerning the relationships to modern forms and the effects on taxonomy of the detachment of plant parts. Through the stimulus of increasing international co-operation, this article attempts to review the response to these factors by Tertiary palynologists over the last 30 years, and examines the problems involved from basic principles. Arguments are presented to encourage the inclusion of details of the geological age in the description of the fossil taxa, so as to help understand evolutionary and stratigraphic processes. It is also thought to be useful to make taxonomic distinction between fossil and modern forms unless there is scientific evidence available to prove similarity. It is important for full discussion to take place before formal changes are made to the Code, and that any alterations are simple and compatible with previous work.

Revision of the citation of the type species of Cochlospermum Kunth., nom. cons., is proposed in order to reflect the fact that the type species, Bombax gossypium Linnaeus, is an illegitimate renaming of Bombax religiosum Linnaeus. Discussions are given of the typification of the three species originally included in Bombax by Linnaeus, each of which has become the type of a generic name, i.e., Bombax Linnaeus, Cochlospermum Kunth, and Ceiba Miller.

10.2307/1219786|The number of hierarchical clustering methods now available in numerical taxonomy is such as to be capable of yielding a bewilderingly large number of dendrograms. Moreover, mathematical criteria for choice of method have met with limited acceptance. The construction of dendrograms, whether on phenetic, eclectic, or cladistic principles, is not, however, the entire process of classification. Although both dendrograms and hierarchical classifications are ultrametric representations of relationship, the latter are always rank-defined while the former may be defined on continuous distances. Even rank-defined dendrograms are often so complex in terms of ranks and branching points (nodes) as to be unacceptable in practice as taxonomic classifications. In such cases a process of simplification is necessary beyond that involved in the ultrametric transformation. Although methods exist for assessing best ultrametric transformation, little consideration has been given to the subsequent simplification process. In this paper the criteria used by taxonomists in determining whether a classification shows an acceptable degree of simplification (e.g., by the compression or splitting of a dendrogram) are analysed. The extent to which a classification meets these criteria is termed its structural value. Psychological research has shown that the hierarchical organisation of stimuli aids memory and that the number of stimuli that can readily be considered at one time shows an upper limit of about five to seven. Hierarchical classification subdivides large groups into mentally more manageable ones ('leaflets' of a hierarchical tree) and it is suggested that the fewer additional taxa (nodes) and additional ranks required to do this, the higher the structural value. A structural value statistic (V) is developed which is the one-complement of a loss function with terms representing the extent to which the leaflet sizes (n
10.2307/1219787|A list of 52 chemical characters is presented for preparing a numerical taxonomy of plant fossils. These characters may be used to determine (1) the degree of chemical similarity among various fossil taxa, (2) the maximum number and the state of characters needed to construct a suprageneric classification corresponding to one based on morphological features, (3) the nature of diagenesis effecting a divergence between chemical and morphological classifications, and (4) the utility of chemical characters in deriving phylogenetic relationships. Results from the analyses of 36 fossil taxa demonstrate the practicality of the proposed system, while comparisons of dendrograms obtained from chemical data and from classical criteria show good agreement. The approach taken in this study can provide an on-line computer basis for the identification of plant fossils, provided that the environment of post-depositional sediment maturation was sufficiently mild.
10.2307/1219788|Variability within and between two species of closely related onions (Allium cernuum Roth and Allium stellatum Wats.) was measured using methods of cluster and principal component analysis. These two widely distributed but overlapping species are sometimes difficult to distinguish. Analysis with 62 characters supports the classification of the two as distinct taxa. The level of dissimilarity between the two taxa falls within the range of interspecies dissimilarity for the genus.
10.2307/1219790|Several species of Verbena were examined for iridoid glucosides. These were found in all species of subgenus Verbenaca investigated. In two of three species of the group Pachystachyae the iridoid glucoside griselinoside was detected, while all species from the group Leptostachyae contained mixtures of cornin and the closely related hastatoside. The species from subgenus Glandularia only occasionally contained iridoids, and in no case were the compounds from subgenus Verbenaca detected.
10.2307/1219791| Herbarium specimens (nearly 350) of New Caledonian species of Phyllanthus (Euphorbiaceae) were analysed for their nickel and cobalt contents with a view to discovering new hyperaccumulators of nickel (>1000 g/g dry mass) and to assisting in chemotaxonomic classification of this difficult genus. A total of 10 hyperaccumulators were identified and it was possible to characterise and identify a number of species from their nickel and/or cobalt contents. This was particularly true for the taxonomically difficult section Heteroglochidion. This work raises to 40 the number of known hyperaccumulators of nickel found in New Caledonia. 
10.2307/1219792|The history of the classification of the genus Carex from 370 B.C.--1955 A.D., including a synopsis of the etymology of the generic name Carex, is reviewed.

10.2307/1219799|The Herbarium of the Geological Survey of Alabama (Mohr Herbarium) was founded in 1878 with the contacting of Charles Mohr by the Alabama State Geologist. The Herbarium remained active until the death of Mohr in 1901 and was directly utilized in two publications, most notably "Plant Life of Alabama." An investigation of its contents reveals that the Herbarium contains 47 types, including four holotypes, six isotypes, two syntypes, and one paratype. A list of these type specimens is provided.

Macbride (1918), the generally used name for rillseale, a chenopodiaceous annual of the western plains of North America. The correction of a lapsus calami establishes A. suckleyi (Torrey) Rydb. as the correct name for this species.
10.2307/1219825|Early confusion of identity and the absence of typification procedures have led to persistent misapplication of the names Lupinus varius L. and Lupinus hirsutus L. A lectotype is now designated for each name, but based on these Types, the names appear to require rejection under Art. 69 of the Code (Leningrad, 1975). Both names are therefore proposed as nomina rejicienda.
10.2307/1219826|The type of Stipa columbiana Macoun belongs to the taxon generally known as S. lemmonii (Vasey) Scribner. Although S. columbiana has priority over S. lemmonii it has never been used for the taxon that includes its type and so must be rejected under Article 69 of the Code. The correct name for the species hitherto known as S. columbiana is S. nelsonii Scribner. This species comprises two subspecies, subsp. nelsonii corresponding to S. columbiana var. nelsonii sensu A. S. Hitchcock and subsp. dorei subsp. nov. corresponding to var. columbiana sensu A. S. Hitchcock. Two varieties are recognised in subsp. nelsonii, var. nelsonii and var. longiaristata var. nov. S. williamsii is a taxonomic synonym of var. nelsonii. The type of S. occidentalis var. minor (Vasey) C. L. Hitchcock belongs to S. lettermanii Vasey.

10.2307/1219592|There was a close interaction between Linnaeus and botanists in Russia. Linnaeus corresponded with many of them, both native Russians and foreign scholars working in Russia. Their letters illustrate the deep concern with identification which dominated botany in the eighteenth century. Through his contacts in Russia, Linnaeus acquired specimens from the earliest collections made in Russia and Siberia and was able to include them in the Species Plantarum. Linnaeus influenced the early development of modern botany in Russia through established scholars working there, and also through Russians who studied under him at Uppsala. Many dissertations reflect Linnaeus' interest in the Russian and Siberian flora. Linnaeus' published works were used in Russian medical schools and some were translated into Russian at the end of the century. Linnaeus had a high opinion of the achievements of Russian botany in the eighteenth century. Collections made throughout the Russian Empire greatly increased the knowledge of the world's flora.
10.2307/1219593|In this paper a correlation between polyploid level and esterase isozyme pattern in individuals from different Spanish populations of Muscari atlanticum has been established. We have taken advantage of this correlation to make a study of the distribution of the reported polyploid levels in 1,017 individuals from thirteen natural populations. The interest in and application of this method for biogeographical analysis are discussed.
10.2307/1219594|The absence of flavonoids in otherwise perfectly preserved tropical plant specimens suggest that chemical solutions used to preserve these specimens in the field are responsible for the removal (i.e. pre-extraction) of flavonoids during pressing and storage in the field. Accordingly, seventeen temperate plant taxa representing two fern and nine angiosperm families were subjected to collecting procedures and preservative solutions typically used in tropical field work. These solutions, especially those containing formaldehyde, effectively "pre-extracted" flavonoids and other phenolics from plants placed in presses and stored in plastic bags, and the newspaper blotter in which the chemically treated specimen had been stored could also be extracted and upon two-dimensional paper chromatography show a partial flavonoid "profile" of spots corresponding to that observed in the "donor" species. Direct extraction of fresh or dried material in flasks with any of the common preservatives used confirms that all of these solutions are highly effective in extracting flavonoids. It is recommended that chemical preservatives not be employed indiscriminately on plant material to be used later in chemotaxonomic surveys.
10.2307/1219595|A generalized system for the concise representation and manipulation of taxonomic descriptions is described. The system is versatile, easy to understand, and designed to minimise coding errors. The descriptions can replace natural-language descriptions both at the time of recording and in publications. The descriptions are also computer-readable, and a program is available for translation into natural language and into the formats required by some key-generation and numerical-classification programs.

10.2307/1219597|In studies where hybridization is suspected, data frequently are presented as Anderson pictorialized scatter diagrams and Anderson hybrid indices. These two techniques, however, introduce inherent biases which influence the reader's interpretation of the data. In this article a new method based on a euclidean distance coefficient is suggested as a replacement for both the pictorialized scatter diagram and hybrid index. It is as simple to perform as the Andersonian techniques but relatively free of biases. Morphological data on Mimulus longiflorus and M. flemingii from Santa Cruz Island, California, were gathered to illustrate the new index of hybridization and to show its advantages over the traditional Anderson pictorialized scatter diagram and hybrid index. Model examples are also used to compare these techniques of data analysis.
10.2307/1219599|According to recent interpretations, all genera in the Acrochaetiaceae other than the monotypic Liagorophila Yamada have been synonymized with Audouinella Bory. In this report the taxonomic relationships of these taxa are examined. None of the characteristics previously used to distinguish Liagorophila are considered adequate, and L. endophytica is transferred to Audouinella. Since the specific epithet endophytica has been used previously in Audouinella, the name Audouinella yamadae, nom. nov., is proposed for this alga.
10.2307/1219600| The taxonomic and nomenclatural history of Commelina medica Lour. and C. tuberosa Lour. is outlined and Loureiro's diagnostic characters are presented. The three tuberous-rooted, scapose Murdannia species from Indochina and south China are described. A complete synonymy is provided for each one and each in turn compared with Loureiro's descriptions of C. medica and C. tuberosa. Murdannia medica, as recently interpreted, is found to have been correctly associated with C. medica. The combinations M. spectabilis and M. edulis are made for the species usually called M. loureirii and M. scapiflora, respectively. The former species usually has been associated with C. tuberosa Lour., but the latter is shown to be Loureiro's plant. Aneilema azureum, A. loureirii . horsfieldii, A. platyphyllum and A. multiscaposum are placed in synonymy for the first time. Murdannia medica and M. spectabilis are found to be closely related to each other but not to M. edulis. The first two are related to M. vaginata because of shared unusual inflorescence and floral morphologies. A new section Vaginatae is described for these three species. The relationships of M. edulis are not established with certainty, but this species must be placed in section Murdannia. 
10.2307/1219601| The eleven species described as Gomphrena L. by Linnaeus are identified as species of Gomphrena, Alternanthera Forsskl, Caraxeron Rafinesque (= Philoxerus auct. mult., non R. Brown) and Froelichia Moench. Alternanthera flava (L.) Mears, comb. nov., is presented. It is demonstrated that Linnaeus' attitudes about the genus Gomphrena were more closely related to inflorescence characteristics than to stamen and stigma number. 
10.2307/1219602|Algae Terrae Novae, an exsiccata of nine sets of benthic marine algae from Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, was distributed from 1968-1978 to more than 60 institutions and individual phycologists throughout the world.

10.2307/1219604| This paper is an historical resum of names that have been used for the group of legumes whose members have papilionoid flowers. When this taxon is treated as a subfamily, the prefix "Papilion-", with various terminations, has predominated. We propose conservation of Papilionoideae as an alternative to Faboideae, coeval with the "unique" conservation of Papilionaceae at the family rank. 
10.2307/1219605|Thirty-nine generic names of living algae are formally proposed for conservation. Two new combinations are made, Hormiscia gregaria (Braun) P. C.

10.2307/1220280|Although current ideas on evolution of the earth's atmosphere vary widely, it seems certain that when plants first invaded the land habitat they were exposed to solar ultraviolet radiation more intense than that found today. We suggest that an early obvious protective adaptation would be the accumulation of substituted cinnamic acids from the deamination of aromatic amino acids. If so, by making possible a diverse range of phenylpropanoid biochemistry, including the synthesis of lignin, this initial adaptation would have exerted a profound effect on the course of higher plant evolution.
10.2307/1220282|The very distinct families Umbelliferae and Asclepiadaceae are both represented in western North America. Local samples of the variability within populations and at several ranks in the classification hierarchy were similar in their ranges of variation. The Asclepiadaceae pattern of variability within populations, species, and genera which was revealed with this data base differed only slightly from that obtained previously with a much smaller data base. The quantifications of within-group variability reveal differences and similarities in patterns of evolution, produce quantifiable models of classification for different families, and can help monographers with taxonomic decisions. A new method of displaying results of intrafamilial patterns of variation uses a log transformation of the CPV and MPD, the summary statistics of the dissimilarity matrices. A comparison of the Umbelliferae, Asclepiadaceae and Bromeliaceae shows the first two to be rather similar in their ranges of intragroup variation at the same ranks and markedly different from the third. The explanation for the similarity between the Asclepiadaceae and Umbelliferae is thought to lie in the coincidence of the general geographic areas where they were sampled and the similarities in their habits: herbaceous, insect pollinated and having umbelliferous inflorescences. The quantifications of infrafamilial patterns of variation clearly show that systematists have tended to mold whatever variation was inherent at the populational level to approximately the same amount of intrageneric variability. Genera in different families seem to encompass very similar amounts of overall variation in spite of differences at the populational level.
10.2307/1220283|The 23 genera of Nassauviinae (Compositae, Mutisieae) have been used as OTU's in a numerical phylogenetic study in an attempt to estimate direction of evolutionary change (polarity), relative amount of evolutionary change (patristics), and relative recency of common ancestry (cladistics) of the group. Thirty-six characters were scored for each OTU. For each character and using 4 criteria, the direction of evolutionary changes of the states, from primitive (ancestral) to derived, was inferred. The Wagner tree algorithm (Farris, 1970) using a distance coefficient was applied to the data, and the index of consistency (Kluge & Farris, 1969) was calculated. Three different evolutionary trees were constructed using as ancestral: (1) a hypothetical OTU, (2) the genus Dolichlasium, and (3) the genus Trixis. Each tree shows somewhat different results, but some cladistic and patristic relationships remained consistent throughout the three runs. The primitive groups: Dolichlasium and Leunisia; Jungia, Pleocarphus, Marticorenia, Trixis and Ameghinoa. The relatively advanced groups: Acourtia, Lophopappus, Proustia and Burkartia; Leucheria and Oxyphyllum; Panphalea, Holocheilus and Perezia. The most highly modified groups: Polyachyrus and Moscharia; Calopappus, Nassauvia and Triptilion. Two genera are intermediate in advancedness and isolated: Macrachaenium; Cephalopappus.

10.2307/1220285|The nomenclature of certain polymorphic temperate genera, notably Crataegus, Mentha, Rubus and Salix, has been rendered more difficult by assumptions of type specimens and the consequential publication of illegitimate names. In Mentha alone, disregarding Gandoger (whose names were declared illegitimate at the Eleventh International Botanical Congress), almost 2300 names have been published for essentially 20 species; possibly 50% of these are synonyms, the remaining legitimate infraspecific names. To bring some order in the chaos of Mentha nomenclature, we herein set forth a choice and discussion of the Linnaean types using Savage (1945), Stearn (1957), Heller (1959), and Stafleu (1978) as our guides.
10.2307/1220286|During the past 150 years, casual nomenclatural practices have obscured what is generally agreed to be a natural system of suprageneric classification in the Asclepiadaceae. An account of all subfamilial, tribal, and subtribal names published within the family is presented here with an evaluation of their nomenclatural status. Some problems of nomenclatural procedure peculiar to levels above the rank of genus and deriving from the nature of the "nomenclatural type" at these levels are discussed with particular regard to the present selection of available names.
10.2307/1220287|Ascyrum L. is now regarded as a synonym of Hypericum L. Typification of all three Linnaean species of this genus has given rise to problems. In particular, Linnaeus's concept of A. cruxandreae was confused; and the present treatment of this species as a synonym of Hypericum mutilum L. is clearly unsatisfactory. Following a review of the nomenclatural history of the three species it is concluded that: (1) A. crux-andreae L. should be lectotypified by Clayton 230 (LINN), i.e., it has priority over Ascyrum stans Michaux ex Willd., so that Hypericum cruxandreae (L.) Crantz replaces H. stans (Michaux ex Willd.) Adams & Robson as the accepted name of a well-known species from south-eastern U.S.A.; (2) A. hypericoides L. should be lectotypified by Plumier, Nov. Pl. Amer. Gen: t.7 (1703), a procedure which preserves the current usage; (3) A. villosum L. should be lectotypified by Plukenet, Phytographia: t.245, f.6 (1691) and treated as a synonym of Hypericum setosum L., thus preserving the current usage. In addition A. multicaule is given a new rank: H. hypericoides subsp. multicaule (Michaux ex Willd.) N. Robson, stat. nov.

The most complete Ecklon & Zeyher collection, including the unicates, is also in S, where lectotypification of Ecklon & Zeyher's taxa is recommended. Statistics for the genera Aspalathus and Crassula are provided as evidence. Because of these early acquisitions, the Stockholm herbarium also contains various other original specimens, e.g. from J.

10.2307/1220291|A danthonoid genus of grasses with about 52 species occurs from South America through New Zealand and Australia to Malesia. Most species occur in New Zealand (23) and Australia (28), and especially in the first country are best known as Notodanthonia Zotov (1963). There are older synonyms, however. The type of Plinthanthesis Steud. (1853) is not P. urvillei Steud., but P. tenuior Steud., a Notodanthonia. Plinthanthesis is proposed for rejection and in the sense of S. T. Blake (1972) renamed Blakeochloa Veldk., nom. nov. Rytidosperma Steud. (1854) has recently been revised for South America (5 species); the type is R. lechleri Steud., identical with R. glabra (Phil.) Nicora; Notodanthonia has been placed in its synonymy, but the necessary new combinations have not yet been made (about 50). Monostachya Merr. (1910) from Malesia (1 species) is linked by intermediate species to Notodanthonia. Notodanthonia is proposed for conservation as it is the best known for the genus, longest in general use, and the least new combinations are required.
10.2307/1220292|Dispute over the lectotypification of the Linnaean genus Bignonia has resulted in numerous conflicting nomenclatural papers during the past century. Repeated interpretations of the protologue and study of both pre- and post-1753 usage have failed to provide a generally accepted type resulting in considerable nomenclatural confusion. Strict application of the Code, in my opinion, results in the acceptance of Bignonia unguis-cati L. as the generic lectotype as it was the first species explicitly so designated. However, the usage of most current floras and botanists would be best served by conserving Bignonia capreolata L. as the lectotype of the genus Bignonia and this is recommended to the Spermatophyta Committee.
10.2307/1220295|Pseudolarix kaempferi Gordon is the correct name for Chinese Golden or False Larch under the Code.
10.2307/1220622|The monotypic genus Aralidium Miq. of the West Malesian floristic region has been assigned by different authors to both the Araliaceae and the Cornaceae. A renewed investigation of floral, stem, and leaf anatomy, and some other features of the genus, confirmed the absence of secretory canals, the dorsal position of the raphe and the peripheral origin of the ventral bundles; these characters preclude the assignment of Aralidium to the Araliaceae. The genus also possesses some features discordant in the Cornaceae, having lobed palisade cells, multilacunar nodes, and fibre-pits without borders. Additionally, the anisocytic stomata and glandular hairs of Aralidium are rarely found in either Araliaceae or Cornaceae. Of the possible relatives, only Griselinia, a genus of the Cornales found in South America and New Zealand, appears to be moderately close, but the two genera differ nonetheless sufficiently to favour the erection of a separate family Aralidiaceae, established herein.
10.2307/1220623|The wood of Aralidium pinnatifidium Miq. is diffuse-porous with the vessels mainly in groups; the perforation plates exclusively scalariform with numerous bars; the parenchyma paratracheal; the rays multiseriate heterogeneous; and the fibres with simple pits and frequently septate. On balance, the wood is, therefore, more like that of the Araliaceae than of the Cornaceae.
10.2307/1220624|Pollen morphology of Aralidium shows no close resemblance to that of the Araliaceae, Cornaceae (sens. lat.), or Griseliniaceae.
10.2307/1220625|A chemical investigation of Aralidium pinnatifidum and four species of Griselinia has demonstrated that iridoid glucosides are present in the former and in the two New Zealand species of the latter. Ten species from the Araliaceae were also examined and found devoid of iridoids. The data suggest a placement of Aralidium within the Cornalian complex.
10.2307/1220627|Protein extracts from Aralidium and 23 species belonging to the families Araliaceae, Cornaceae, Garryaceae, Griseliniaceae, Nyssaceae, Saxifragaceae, and Umbelliferae were used as antigens to test with Aralidium antisera in Ouchterlony, Boyden, immunoelectrophoresis, and rocket immunoelectrophoresis (RIE) experiments. Rocket immunoelectrophoresis, a recently developed and sensitive serological technique, was the only technique which produced precipitins (rockets) in cross-reacting experiments with any species, and then only those belonging to the Cornaceae and Nyssaceae. Therefore, based on antigenic protein information Aralidium should be treated as a monotypic genus in the family Aralidiaceae which has distant relationship, first with the Cornaceae and secondly, even more distant relationship, with the Nyssaceae. No protein similarity was detected between Aralidium and any of the other species tested. RIE proved to be a very valuable technique for use in plant systematic serological research.
10.2307/1220628|Polyploidy is reported for the first time for Montanoa Cerv., in which x = 19; we here report species at the 6x, 8x, and 12x levels. The 12x count (n = 110-120) was originally reported, owing to a printing error, as Melanthera aspera (Jacq.) Rendl., and is significant as it is the highest reported number in Compositae.
10.2307/1220630|Two species of Mexican spruce, Picea chihuahuana and P. mexicana, have been named and described within the last 40 years. In addition a spruce population that does not match any known species has recently been reported. In this study, 30 specimens from each of six populations of Mexican spruce, four of P. chihuahuana, one of P. mexicana, and the unnamed population, were systematically analyzed using chemical and morphological characters. In addition, two populations of P. engelmannii and one of P. pungens, from southern Arizona and New Mexico, U.S.A., respectively, were similarly analyzed. The data derived from the chemical and morphological studies were in close agreement and indicated that: 1) Picea mexicana is a disjunct population (variety) of P. engelmannii; 2) Picea chihuahuana is a distinct species with no close affinity to other taxa examined; 3) the unnamed population appears to constitute a relict hybrid swarm, one parent being P. engelmannii (including P. mexicana) the other possibly P. chihuahuana or P. pungens. Finally, the characteristics used by Martinez (1961) to separate P. engelmannii from P. mexicana were reexamined and found not to differ significantly in the two taxa. Therefore it is proposed that P. mexicana be reduced to varietal status as P. engelmannii var. mexicana.
10.2307/1220631|An estimate of the evolutionary history of the 20 taxa comprising the R. hispidus complex is presented. This reconstruction of evolutionary history was developed by the use of character compatibility analysis. Two evolutionary lines which correspond to the major phenetic groups are recognized. The estimate of evolutionary history is discussed with respect to earlier phenetic studies and geographic distribution. A suggestion is offered for the use of cladistic analyses in the formulation of a classification.
10.2307/1220632|W. W. Watts was an important figure in Australian botany at the beginning of the 20th century. This paper presents a biographical sketch of Watts with emphasis on his contributions to bryology and to the botany of Australia. A bibliography of publications by and about Watts is included. Appendices list types based on Watts' collections, fern types described by Watts and the numerous eponymous uses of Watts' name for bryophyte species. An account of his major collecting areas is also given.
10.2307/1220633|The problems of defining "printed matter" for the purposes of effective publication under the "Code of Botanical Nomenclature" are discussed. Modern techniques have blurred the distinction between traditional printing and reproduction from typescript. It is concluded, however, that the precise method of reproduction is less important than the accessibility of the printed matter to the botanical community. The present rules imply that publication is effected by distributing a copy of almost any non-autographic material to each of only two botanical institutions. Some further restrictions seem desirable and, with increasing use of modern methods of reproduction, a decision on this has become urgent. A proposal is made to restrict effective publication, in future, to established journals and to such other works as explicitly claim to be media for such publication and also indicate that specified minimal distributional requirements have been met. Two further proposals are made: one dealing with an editoral matter and the other establishing a committee to review those problems of effective publication that are not dealt with in the first proposal.
10.2307/1220634|Problems of defining "effective publication" in relation to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature are discussed. Modern technological developments make the definition of "printed matter" obscure, and the number of copies and mode of dispersal of them similarly make "publication" difficult to define. Special problems created by theses, symposium hand-outs and correction slips are discussed. Two proposals are made to clarify the existing Article 29 of the Code, and a further proposal is made that a special committee be set up to consider ways in which "effective publication" might be restricted in future.
10.2307/1220636| The Committee recommends acceptance of proposals to conserve Bystropogon L'Hrit., Fittonia Coemans, Vigna Savi and Macrotyloma (Wight & Arnott) Verdcourt, and a proposal to amend the entry under Peyrousea A. P. de Candolle; considers that conservation of Toona (Endl.) M. J. Roemer and Griseliana G. Forster is unnecessary; rejects proposals to conserve Eustylis Engelmann & A. Gray and Peltiphyllum (Engler) Engler and a proposal to amend the entry under Triguera Cavanilles; and does not recommend acceptance of proposals to reject the specific names Nonea echioides (L.) Roemer & Schultes and Orchis latifolia L. at present, but offers to reconsider these if necessary after the next Congress. 
10.2307/1220637|The correct specific epithet of a hepatic species is discussed in the light of Article 73 of the Code. The trivial name "nemorea" is regarded as an orthograhic error for nemorosa.
10.2307/1220638|Under the present provision of Article 33 of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, automatic autonyms, for taxonomic ranks of certain categories mandated by past editions of the Code, can be considered as validly published and must be taken into consideration for nomenclatural purposes in some specific instances. As the Codes under which this provision was allowed implied that such autonyms were to be automatically established and were not to be taken into consideration for purposes of priority, nor were authorships assigned to such autonyms, it is suggested that the present Code be modified so as to exclude previously mandated autonyms from considerations of priority.
10.2307/1220639|It is shown that the name Casuarina equisetifolia was validly published by Linnaeus in 1759. The genus was treated as monotypic, based on a plate in Rumphius' "Herbarium Amboinense", and the authority of the genus is therefore also to be attributed to Linnaeus. Rumphius' name for the species, Casuarina litorea, was not accepted by Linnaeus.
10.2307/1220329|Evidence from wood, leaf, and floral anatomy, from palynology, and from reconsideration of vegetative and reproductive morphology fully support (1) the placement of Heteropyxis by Fernandes (1971), Stern & Brizicky (1958), and Weberling (1963) in Myrtaceae/Leptospermoideae on the basis of organography, palynology, and petiole and wood anatomy, and (2) the placement of Psiloxylon by van Tieghem (1904) in Myrtaceae on the basis of especially vegetative anatomy. Diagnostic myrtaceous characters shared by both genera include: entire, simple, gland-dotted, penninerved leaves wth intramarginal veins; rudimentary stipules (Heteropyxis only); pentamery; nectary lining floral tube; imbricate, persistent calyx; many pollen features; sunken styles; baccate or capsular fruits (resp. Psiloxylon and Heteropyxis); exalbuminous seeds; bicollateral bundles; secretory cavities in all aerial organs, including the anthers; unilacunar one-trace nodes; arcuate petiolar bundles with sclerenchymatous sheaths (only in lamina of Psiloxylon); vestured pits; wood fibers with distinctly bordered pits; and tannin. Both genera, however, differ from many, but not all Myrtaceae in having: alternate leaves; unisexual, but bisexual-appearing flowers (only the staminate in Psiloxylon); perigyny; few stamens (Psiloxylon diplostemonous, Heteropyxis essentially obdiplostemonous); short style and divided stigma (Psiloxylon only); cancellate seed (Psiloxylon only); and such wood characters as septate, crystalliferous fibers and lack of vasicentric tracheids in Psiloxylon, and lack of axial parenchyma in Heteropyxis. The segregates Heteropyxidaceae and Psiloxylaceae should thus be included in Myrtaceae. The foregoing ensemble of characters conclusively excludes for Heteropyxis any assignment to Rhamnaceae or Rutaceae, for Psiloxylon any assignment to Bixaceae sensu lato, Flacourtiaceae, or Guttiferae, and for both genera an assignment to Lythraceae. Because it would be anomalous in either of the two traditional myrtaceous subfamilies, Psiloxylon is best treated as a new subfamily in Myrtaceae. Finally, since Leptospermeae and Chamaelaucieae differ as much from each other as either does from Myrteae, Chamaelaucieae should be elevated to subfamilial status in Myrtaceae. The family Myrtaceae thus has four subfamilies: Myrtoideae, Psiloxyloideae, Leptospermoideae, and Chamaelaucioideae. An addendum discusses Briggs & Johnson's (1979) detailed paper on vegetative and especially reproductive structure of Myrtaceae.
10.2307/1220331|Generic names validly published in the Monthly review by Salisbury are identified, as are other overlooked names published by him elsewhere. Kunzea Rchb. (Myrtaceae) should be conserved against Tillospermum Salisb. Three of Salisbury's generic names in current use are antedated by others. It is pointed out that Homoglossum is antedated by Petamenes [Salisb. ex] J. W. Loud. (Iridaceae) and that Eurycles is a synonym of Proiphys Herb. (Amaryllidaceae), while Dipidax gives way to Onixotis Raf. (Liliaceae); the four necessary new combinations are made. Appended is a list of 64 overlooked names of tropical and subtropical plants of the Old World, though some names referable to South African Aloe and Erica spp. remain obscure.
10.2307/1220332|The following nomenclatural judgements upon disputed or doubtful names are made in compliance with the Code, and changes made as follows: 1. Dryopteris austriaca (Jacquin) Woynar, based on Nephrodium austriacum Jacquin, can only have applied to Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn from its description, though the type is missing. A lectotype proposed by Jermy of a Dryopteris species cannot be taken as type material and is rejected as such, as are two other candidates for type material. A neotype is therefore designated. The name D. dilatata (Hoffm.) A. Gray is to be used instead for the Dryopteris species. 2. The name D. carthusiana (Vill.) H. P. Fuchs is retained as definitely applying to the taxon it is at present widely used for, despite the apparent absence of a type. A neotype is designated. 3. Dryopteris paleaceae (Sw.) Hand.-Mazz. is the corrected citation for D. paleacea (Don) Hand.-Mazz. and replaces D. wallichiana (Spreng.) Hyl., as it appears that Don was taking the name Aspidium paleaceum from Swartz without directly acknowledging it, though he does cite Swartz indirectly; therefore, Aspidium paleaceum Swartz, which is the earliest name, can be legitimately transferred to Dryopteris. The species concerned is found throughout tropical regions of the world, there being no major differences between the typical South American and Himalayan populations.
10.2307/1220333| Flowers of plants obtained after artificial crosses between Rhinanthus minor L. and R. serotinus (Schnh.) Oborny are compared with flowers in field samples of mixed populations. Hybridization and introgression in different degrees are found to occur in the field. Arguments are given that the occurrence of both is influenced by the behaviour of flower-visiting bumblebees and their numbers. In the field seed set in open-pollinated hybrid plants was reduced compared with that of the parents. Variance in seed production is related to hybrid index value in open-pollinated plants and to stigma position in caged ones. Stigma position is an important character for the direction of hybridization and introgression. 
10.2307/1220334|The species Peltaria emarginata (Boiss.) Hausskn., from areas of serpentine in northern Greece and Euboea, has been found to accumulate extremely high concentrations of nickel, often exceeding 1% of the dry mass of the plant leaf. Extreme behaviour of this kind is not found in other species of Peltaria, nor in related genera such as Ricotia, even for those plants which have grown on a nickel-rich substrate. Several herbarium specimens labelled Peltaria dumulosa Post have also been shown to have very high nickel levels. P. dumulosa appears never to have been described properly, and the specimens have now been identified as Alyssum samariferum Boiss. & Hausskn., a species in which nickel accumulation has been demonstrated previously.
10.2307/1220335|Dates of publication for parts of William Curtis' "Flora Londinensis" are presented from new sources.
10.2307/1220336|Having considered the publications over the past 240 years devoted to the nomenclature and taxonomy of Dichaena, it has been found that the legitimate name for its ascus form is Dichaena rugosa. For the conidial states the valid names are Psilospora faginea and Dichaenopsis notarisii. Observations on the spermatia and receptive hyphae are mentioned.
10.2307/1220337|Following morphological and anatomical study of 230 species of Poaceae, representing 156 genera putatively of subfamily Pooideae, the subfamily has been recircumscribed in detail. A subfamily description is provided giving frequencies of states for characters; the 148 genera included are listed, and reasons are given for excluding others.
10.2307/1220341| A lectotype is chosen for Timmia bavarica Hessler. Major inconsistencies have been discovered between the first and second editions of Fasc. 1-5 of Funck's "Cryptogamische Gewchse des Fichtelgebirg's (1801-1806). 
10.2307/1219381|The brief but productive career of the British phanerogamic botanist Herbert Fuller Wernham is described and a list of his publications given.
10.2307/1219382|The plants newly described by E. N. Bancroft, particularly in newspapers, are identified; of these, Cassia porturegalis (Leguminosae) is C. italica (Mill.) Spreng., a name published in 1800. Resulting from a search of early Jamaican botanical literature, overlooked binomials are identified, as are the overlooked names of other Caribbean plants: Psidium wrightii Krug & Urban, non Wright (Myrtaceae) becomes P. parvifolium (Griseb.) Griseb. Names published by Bancroft senior are considered and appended is a list of a further 80 overlooked names of New World plants: all are identified except for some species of Alloplectus, Opuntia, Passiflora and Zea, which remain obscure, while Chaetanthera tenella gives way to C. ramosissima (Compositae).
10.2307/1219383|A method was developed and a program written in BASIC language to calculate a similarity coefficient using the overlap of character ranges between individuals as criteria. Input data consist of two individuals (n) by character (p) matrices, one at the lower range limit and the other at the high range limit. Output from the program consists of one half of an n<sup>2</sup> matrix (including the principal diagonal) of similarity values, a list of diagnostic characters between pairs of individuals and an optional list of the frequency of non-matches for each character. The similarity values can be used directly to create classification schemes by assigning cutoff percentiles for each taxon or hierachial units can be generated by various clustering programs.
10.2307/1219384|Silene alba Muhl. ex Britton (1893), although considered to be an illegitimate substitution for S. nivea (Nutt.) Otth, is validly published and as a result S. alba (Miller) E. H. L. Krause (1901), the widely used name for the weed white campion or white cockle, is illegitimate. It is shown that the correct name for this species in Silene is S. pratensis (Rafn) Godron & Gren. A new taxonomic treatment of the infraspecific variation within S. pratensis is outlined and three new subspecific combinations proposed.
10.2307/1219385|Peperomia poeppigii Miq. is found to be the oldest name for the species of Commelinaceae usually called Geogenanthus undatus (C. Koch & Linden) Mildbr. & Strauss. The new combination Geogenanthus poeppigii (Miq.) Faden is made.
10.2307/1219386|The tribe name Ixechineae (Boletaceae) is validly published having been invalidly published by Heim (1939). A discussion of the infratribal taxonomy of Ixechineae is presented. Two genera, Ixechinus Heim ex Horak and Mucilopilus Wolfe, are recognized in the Ixechineae. Fistulinella Hennings is not considered in this work to be taxonomically synonymous with either Ixechinus or Mucilopilus since Fistulinella violates the circumscriptions of both of these genera. Furthermore, Fistulinella also violates the circumscription of Ixechineae and, therefore, cannot be included in this tribe. Because of the uncertainty of some character states of Fistulinella, it must be placed among the Genera Incertae Sedis of the Boletaceae.
10.2307/1219387|It is contended that the proposed conservation of such lectotypes as that of Bombax ceiba L. for the genus Bombax is unnecessary. To insist that the type of a genus must conform completely with the generic protologue is an unreasonable requirement. The lectotype of the genus Jatropha L. (Euphorbiaceae) is discussed as another example of this proposed but illadvised requirement. It is argued that such proposals for conservation be rejected.
10.2307/1219388|The taxonomy and nomenclature of Rheede's names, Pongam seu Minari, Tsjeria-Cametti-Valli, Noel-Valli, Karin-Tagera and Ana-Mullu in Hortus Malabaricus (1686-88), are discussed. A new combination, Dalbergia horrida (Dennst.) Mabberly var. glabrescens, is proposed.
10.2307/1219389|Two species of Schaueria now recognized in the genus Carlowrightia, S. linearifolia Torrey and S. parvifolia Torrey, are based on mixed collections. They are lectotypified here for the first time.
10.2307/1219390|The present system of disparate starting points for fungi is shown to be incapable of producing a stable unambiguous nomenclature. Its faithful application not only imposes an intolerable sterile bibliographic burden on taxonomists but also forces them to make subjective biological decisions. A solution to this problem exists in Prop. 32 for modification of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. This proposal would give a single starting point date of 1753 for all fungi but would retain the protected status granted by the existing Art. 13.I.f to names used by Fries in his "Systema" vol. 2 and 3 extend it to vol. 1 and to Persoon's "Synopsis" for the names for which this was the starting point book. The advantages for nomenclatural stability and simplicity of this proposal are outlined, and contrasted with the catastrophic changes that would arise from adoption of the current Prop. 31 (which we therefore strongly oppose).
10.2307/1219398|Fresh evidence shows that the conclusion reached by Dandy and Fosberg in Taxon 3: 231-232 (1954) on the application of Amaryllis belladonna L., is not correct. Linnaeus did not use nor did he describe the Clifford Herbarium specimen of the Cape Belladonna Lily, but relied solely on consistent literature for the Barbados Lily (Hippeastrum puniceum, syn. H. equestre) in his Hortus Cliffortianus and hence in Species Plantarum, 1753.
10.2307/1219403|Dr. Nicolson's arguments on Article 48 and the Mitracarpus case are not easy to follow (Taxon 26: 569-574, 1977). He has not made out a case that the Article is likely to be misused, nor that it needs amendment ahead of a consideration of other Articles. He demonstrates that Mitrocarpus villosus is not legitimate, but M. hirtus (Linn.) de Candolle cannot replace it. A new combination is needed.
10.2307/1219404|The proposal by R. D. Meikle to amend Article 32 ("Taxon" 28(5/6): 600-601, 1979) should be rejected. It has an arbitrary purpose in intending to validate a name in a sense contrary to what its author arguably intended, and contrary to general usage of that name. Further, it does not achieve the intended result, although it may be mistakenly held to do so.
10.2307/1219407| Auf Grund der Nennung von Richard's Namen in Bridel's Originalbeschreibung von Climacium americanum Brid. wird ein Lecotyp fr diese Art in Richard's Herbarium (PC) ausgewhlt, zumal Bridel's Herbarium (B) ein zur Typifizierung von C. americanum geeignetes Examplar nicht enthlt. Die Nennung von Richard's Namen durch Bridel im Zusammenhang mit der Flora Boreali-americana untersttzt die Ansicht, dass Richard auch als Autor zumindest des Bryophyten-Teiles dieses Werkes in Frage kommt. 
10.2307/1219410|This note points out that the name of the type locality of Orcuttia fragilis Swallen is neither Llano Dirai nor Llano Datillare, the only names which appear in the literature and/or on labels of the type material. The area is actually Llanos de Hiray.
10.2307/1219411|Article 73 of the ICBN requires that the orthography of the endemic, ditypic Mexican and Central American genus of the Juglandaceae, long known as a section of the genus Engelhardia, should be Oreamunoa Oerst. rather than Oreomunnea as originally published and as almost invariably adopted today.
10.2307/1219412|Preparation of the series of conservation proposals dealing with Hypholoma (Fr.) Kumm. necessitated confrontation of the Nematoloma-Naematoloma sequence of publication question. Contrary to the text given in the Index Nominum Genericorum (Farr et al., 1979), it appears that Karsten first published the generic name as "Nematoloma."
10.2307/1219420|The generic names Hypholoma (Fr.) Kummer and Nematoloma Karst. are both widely used today for a group of around 20 well-known species (Moser, 1978; Singer, 1975). Because of our interest in this group of fungi we wished to determine which of these names is correct. It is our conclusion that the problem cannot be resolved without recourse to the mechanism of conservation. Because current usage is clearly divided and any proposed solution is, therefore, likely to meet with opposition, three alternative proposals are offered. One of these would conserve Hypholoma with a type that will make that name correct for the taxa involved; another would conserve Nematoloma against Hypholoma; and the third would reject Hypholoma as typified on a species now recognized in the genus Psathyrella, making it necessary to conserve Psathyrella over Hypholoma.
10.2307/1220138| This paper is intended to develop a framework for a more extensive study of the role of the German journal "Flora" in the development of systematic botany in the nineteenth century. In the first part of the paper, short biographies are given of the editors in the period 1818-1888, with a special section about their relation with "Flora". D. H. Hoppe (1760-1846) was editor, and actually publisher as well, from 1818-1842. F. G. Eschweiler (1796-1831) assisted Hoppe as co-editor from 1827-1829. In 1830 A. E. Frnrohr (1804-1861) became co-editor. Frnrohr succeeded Hoppe as editor in 1843 and served as such until 1861. Like Hoppe, Frnrohr was actually publisher of "Flora" as well. After Frnrohr's sudden death, the zoologist G. A. W. Herrich-Schffer (1799-1874) took over the editorship. He was succeeded in 1871 by J. Singer (1834-1901). From its very beginning "Flora" was published actually or nominally in Regensburg by the Regensburgische Botanische Gesellschaft. The relationship between the journal and the Society came to an end in 1888, when Singer transferred the editorship to K. I. E. von Goebel, who from that date published the journal in Marburg. 
10.2307/1220139|A formal infrageneric classification for the genus Helianthus is presented. The classification was derived using phenetic, cladistic and biosystematic procedures. The 49 species of Helianthus are placed into four sections and seven series.
10.2307/1220140| In this research we have demonstrated that the storage proteins, Aquilegilin and Tubiflorin, occur in nearly all taxa of the Magnoliophytina (angiosperm) families tested. Jensen and Penner (1980) have reported the value of comparing partially purified seed storage proteins extracted for plant taxonomic research. Bttner and Jensen (1981) established the homology of seed storage proteins isolated from Aquilegia vulgaris and Digitalis purpurea. The different amounts of serological reactivity detected among various plant taxa have been interpreted as being a reflection of evolutionary differences in the primary structure of the protein. While the serological differences were great between taxa of different families, taxa of different genera within each family usually were distinguishable only when the reference systems (antisystems) had been obtained from the same family. However, proteins obtained from species within a single genus were difficult to distinguish. The serological experiments comparing the proteins from different Magnoliophytina (angiosperm) families (Fig. 4), generally reflect the relationships of the tested families with the Ranunculaceae and the Scrophulariaceae as reference families. /// [German] Whrend Jensen and Penner (1980) bereits den vergleichenden Einsatz von isolierten Samen-Reserveproteinen in der Verwandtschaftsforschung als sinnvoll erkannt hatten, konnten Bttner and Jensen (1981) auf die Homologie von in Aquilegia vulgaris und Digitalis purpurea -- Samen enthaltenen Reserveproteinen hinweisen. Jetzt zeigte sich, dass die Reserveproteine Aquilegilin und Tubiflorin in den Vertretern fast aller getesteter Angiospermenfamilien vorkommen. Ihre abgestufte serologische Reaktivitt deutet auf evolutive Vernderungen der Primrstruktur hin. Whrend die serologischen Unterschiede bei Vertretern verschiedener Familien betrchtlich sind, sind Vertreter verschiedener Gattungen einer Familie oft nur mit Hilfe von Bezugssystemen (Antisystemen) aus dieser Familie differenzierbar. Die benutzten Reserveproteine aus Arten einer Gattung schliesslich sind nur schwer unterscheidbar. Die serologischen Vergleiche der beiden Proteine aus einer Reihe von Angiospermenfamilien fhrten zu einem Bild (Fig. 4), das die abgestuften Verwandtschaftsverhltnisse in Bezug auf die Ranunculaceen und Scrophulariaceen im allgemeinen widerspiegelt. 
10.2307/1220141|Thirty-one species of Alyxia from New Caledonia were analysed for their manganese content. Most of the species showed excessive uptake of manganese with a maximum of 1.15% Mn in dried leaves of A. rubricaulis. The manganese content alone was sufficient to distinguish a number of species from each other. Composite samples were in addition analysed for calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium. Correlation analysis and calculation of the slopes of regression lines showed that manganese uptake was mainly at the expense of calcium, rather than magnesium. Similarly magnesium was preferred to potassium and potassium to sodium. It is possible that manganese may have some physiological role in Alyxia, compensating to some extent for reduced uptake of the nutrients calcium and potassium.
10.2307/1220142|An automated taxonomic data bank for grass genera is described, and an example of an automatically typeset generic description is presented. There are 324 generic descriptions currently available, coded in DELTA format. These are provided on microfiche, translated into English by CONFOR, along with a sample key to eu-panicoids generated by the program KEY.
10.2307/1220143|About twelve species of Lupinus are centered in the Mediterranean and North African parts of the Old World. They show limited morphologocal polymorphism, but they are diverse in other ways. The group as a whole features three unique characteristics of evolutionary significance: (a) a special geographical distribution, disjunct from the main center in America, with allopatric rough-seeded and partially sympatric smooth-seeded species; (b) karyotype polymorphism, with at least seven different chromosome numbers, none of which has been encountered in the New World; (c) systematic disassociation, by which most species are taxonomically unrelated and genetically isolated. This cyto-geographical complex pattern and systematic divergence are best understood on the assumption that a few lupines of various origins migrated by means of long-range dispersal from their primary center in North America during the Neogene. The migrations were repeated quite haphazardly. Rough-seeded migrules were established in NW Africa, while smooth-seeded ones arrived at the Mediterranean, probably later on. During the Miocene lupine populations spread and diverged along the Mediterranean and in Africa north of the equator, succeeding the Tethyan flora. Their present eco-geographical distribution is the outcome of both climatic and edaphic changes during the Quaternary, combined with the impact of human activities from the Pleistocene on. Whereas the evolution of Lupinus in the New World has been enhanced by processes such as ecological differentiation and intensive hybridization, that of the Old World lupines has been inhibited owing to rapidly increasing aridity and civilization. The main changes in the gene pool of wild populations could be caused by disruptive differentiation, i.e., occasional hybridization and subsequent intergradations with escaped or neglected, sporadically domesticated strains.
10.2307/1220144|A historical perspective reviews the origins of plant taxonomy and its relationship with plant fossils. Linnaeus contributed the notion of binomial nomenclature with the sole purpose of providing a label for the species. Subjective attributes such as stratigraphic occurrence or presumed phylogenetic relationship have no place in taxonomic circumscription. Names of taxa are stabilized by nomenclatural types, to which the name is permanently attached. Nomenclature and taxonomy are entirely different concepts. The I.C.B.N. provides Rules for stabilizing the nomenclature, and strict adherence to these is beneficial to all palynologists. Their judgement on how to best group and subdivide their material may vary; proper nomenclatural procedures will allow later workers to re-arrange these data without confusion. Practical problems of spore systematics result from imperfect knowledge and understanding. Virtually identical problems are faced by palaeobotanists working with named parts of plants, by mycologists or phycologists working with named stages in life cycles, and even by neobotanists working with incomplete herbarium specimens. There are no reasons for palynologists to aim for nomenclatural procedures different from those of other plant taxonomists. Recent suggestions by Boulter and Pirozynski and proposals by Hughes to change the I.C.B.N. so as to give special consideration to special groups of fossils are ill considered and here rejected.
10.2307/1220145|Article 10.1 of the ICBN is discussed in reference to the typification of the generic names Diamorpha Nuttall (Crassulaceae), Leucaena Benth. (Leguminosae), Odontonema Nees (Acanthaceae), Picrodendron Planchon (Euphorbiaceae), and Pseudolarix Gordon (Pinaceae). It is argued that the nomenclatural type of each of these genera is the species described by their respective authors and not the binomial cited in each case in which the genus was thought to be monotypic when described or, in the case of Leucaena, its lectotype is the first species chosen in spite of its alleged binomial belonging to another genus.
10.2307/1220146|The recently published Report of the Committee on Generic Typification did not deal adequately with the case for abandoning that part of Art. 10 of the Code that reads "the type of the name of a genus... is a species" nor did it provide examples of the effect of its various Proposals to amend the Code. This paper attempts to deal with this inadequacy and meet this omission.
10.2307/1220147|The arguments are presented concluding that the names Lupinus hilarianus Benth. and Cytisus heptaphyllus Velloso were applied to very different material and certainly do not belong to the same species. It is concluded that C. heptaphyllus does not belong in the genus Lupinus. It is questionable whether the name fits any of the species currently known for allied genera. Article 63 prohibits the use of L. hilarianus, so the next name published which applies to specimens of the species involved, Lupinus gibertianus C. P. Smith, must be accepted.
10.2307/1220154|It is again demonstrated that Gossypium sandvicense Parlatore is the correct name of the endemic Hawaiian Gossypium and that the lectotype of Gossypium tomentosum Seem. should be Seemann 28 (K), a specimen collected in Fiji and a synonym of Gossypium hirsutum L. s.l. The greater part of the original description of Gossypium tomentosum was derived from the introduced Fijian cotton and contradicts the characters possessed by the Hawaiian species.
10.2307/1220159|Von Rohr and Vahl's paper is shown to be composed, in essence, of two independent papers by each author on the same specimens. Von Rohr described and named seven new genera, two with new species, and described one new species in an existing genus. Vahl accepted one of von Rohr's species and renamed two, published two new species, and identified three of von Rohr's genera with existing species. The editor, Lund, cut and pasted these two papers together. The authorship, nomenclature, and current identification(s) of all names are given. A proposal is made to conserve the commonly used spelling, Pseudelephantopus, against the original spelling, Pseudo-Elephantopus.
10.2307/1220163|It is proposed that, until the regulation of Effective Publication has been dealt with by a Special Committee, Recommendation 29 A be extended in order to restrict the publication of new names and descriptions to easily available publications, viz. mainly to botanical periodicals having good distribution.
10.2307/1220166|Eclipta alba (L.) Hassk. and E. prostrata (L.) L. appear to represent extremes of a single, highly variable taxon. The name E. prostrata (L.) L. was first used by Roxburgh (1832) when he combined E. alba and E. prostrata. The example given under Article 57 of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature states that Hasskarl (1848) was the first to unite these two taxa and that his choice of E. alba for the combined taxon must be followed. However, Roxburgh's choice of E. prostrata predates Hasskarl by 16 years and is the correct name when the two taxa are united.
10.2307/1219938|Biogeography is currently in an exciting, challenging, revolutionary stage. Quantitative biogeography, both at the historical and ecological levels, will play an increasingly important role because rapidly increasing amounts of data will require quantitative methods and computer analysis. An effective way to comprehend quantitative methods and to determine when they can be effective is to consider any biogeographic study as a multistage decision process. Not only does this provide a framework for such activities, but it also emphasizes that one's conclusions are affected by decisions made at different stages of the study. The best perspective is that biogeography is an unending synthesis, both of many types of theories and of many types of data and analyses to test them. A corollary to this approach is that no single method or analysis can answer all questions of biogeographic interest. Finally, while computers and quantitative analyses can enhance the human mind, they can never replace it.
10.2307/1219939|The methods of Wagner network and Wagner tree construction are presented. A worked example, based on a set of hypothetical taxa, is examined in detail. Additional examples, representing real and artificial data sets, are also examined. The existence of alternative choices at several stages in the algorithms leads to solutions that may not be most parsimonious estimates. There apparently is no non-arbitrary method for choosing between the alternatives. The examples presented illustrate that there may be multiple equally parsimonious solutions for a given data set and that neither algorithm can ensure a most parsimonious solution.
10.2307/1219940|An exact method of performing character compatibility analysis by hand is presented.
10.2307/1219941|Single specimens and population samples (about 1000 plants in total) from 12 species of Lotus collected throughout Israel have been tested for cyanogenic compounds by the sodium-picrate test. Various distribution patterns were found: In 3 species all plants were cyanogenic; in another 3 all were acyanogenic; and in the remaining 6 species varying degrees of cyanogenic polymorphism could be observed. Polymorphism tends to occur more often between than within populations of a species. A geographical trend was found only in L. halophilus where the ratio of cyanogenic plants in populations decreased towards the more arid areas. Except for the possible reduction in cyanogenesis in systematic groups with x = 6, no uniform correlation with morphotaxonomic or ecogeographic characters were found. Different Lotus species do not have a uniform response to conditions described previously as selective for or against cyanogenesis in L. corniculatus or Trifolium repens. For that reason no general hypotheses explaining the polymorphism of cyanogenesis can be formed and it is proposed that all such theories should be tested only at the specific level and even then within a regional frame.
10.2307/1219942|In an evolutionary continuum there can be no discontinuities delimiting species. Geographical barriers may rise or fall, separating or rejoining specific populations. Members of "biological species" are self-distinguishing. "Taxonomists' species" are distinguishable to experts according to their competence and preference. "Nominal species" are taxa named for our convenience.
10.2307/1219943|The centostecoid grasses comprise several genera of worldwide distribution, considered variously as a group, series, or subfamily. At the latter rank, the Centostecoideae must be validated by Latin description, which is offered here.
10.2307/1219944|In the course of a phytochemical investigation of 124 populations within Bupleurum L. and some related genera, 78 constituents were found. The distribution of these compounds, as compared with the phyletic scheme of the group, indicates that a reduction in the number of constituents and a concomitant increase in synthetic specialization paralleled evolutionary advance.
10.2307/1219945|A numerical method is presented to describe flowering plant families, obtaining the frequency of a character in each family by calculating the percentage of genera which possess the character.
10.2307/1219946|The first lectotypification of Polygonum L., designating P. lapathifolium as type, has been consistently ignored in favour of P. aviculare. It does not appear that this first designation of a lectotype can be superseded under the ICBN. Accordingly, to avoid disadvantageous changes in nomenclature, Polygonum L. is proposed for conservation with P. aviculare as type. Polygonum aviculare has been widely used in two different senses, for a homophyllous tetraploid and for a heterophyllous hexaploid. Its first lectotypification by a specimen of the heterophyllous species has recently been challenged. It is established that this challenge is unfounded under the ICBN, but, nevertheless, it is concluded that the name has been widely and persistently used for a taxon not including its type and must be rejected under ICBN Art. 69. A new wording of Art. 69 is proposed that would permit the retention of P. aviculare by those who recognise only a single species for the two chromosome races.
10.2307/1219951| Virgulus Raf. (1837) is the earliest available name for those species of Aster L. with a basic chromosome number of x = 5, or derived x = 4. This name has priority over the recently reinstated Lasallea Greene (1903) which is additionally an orthographic variant of Lasallia Mrat (1821), a lichen. The necessary transfers are made from Aster to Virgulus. 
10.2307/1219952|The publication date of Amann J. et al., Flore des mousses de la Suisse should be considered as 31 December 1918.
10.2307/1219953|Roylean Podophyllum specimens mounted on sheet no. 13/1 in deposit at the Merseyside County Museums (LIV), Liverpool (Great Britain), has been identified and designated as the lectotype of Podophyllum hexandrum Royle.
10.2307/1220075|An earlier proposal that Conocephalum conicum may exist as a group of geographic races is supported by a more extensive survey of the flavonoid glycosides isolated from samples across its Northern Hemisphere distribution. European, North American, and Asian samples are clearly distinguished, and sub-groups may be recognised within these broad subdivisions. The local Sino-Japanese species C. supradecompositum is clearly distinguished on the basis of flavonoid glycosides from C. conicum.
10.2307/1220076| Four weedy taxa of Bidens are common in Thunder Bay: B. cernua, B. connata, B. frondosa and B. vulgata. Since B. connata is intermediate in gross morphology and ecological preference between B. cernua and B. frondosa, and since it is only found in areas where B. cernua and B. frondosa are sympatric, an investigation was undertaken to determine whether B. connata is of hybrid origin (B. cernua  B. frondosa). Representative specimens of the 4 taxa were scored for 23 morphological characters, and these data were analyzed by Principal Coordinates Analysis. Seed germination and pollen viability were determined to be high with no significant differences among the 4 taxa. Morphological and cytological data suggest that B. connata (2n = 48) is the result of either a cross between an unreduced gamete of B. cernua (2n = 24) with a normal gamete of B. frondosa (2n = 48), or a cross between a 2n = 24 of B. frondosa with a typical gamete of B. cernua. Since B. connata shows no decrease in seed viability and apparently produces pollen by mitosis only, Thunder Bay populations of B. connata evidently comprise an agamic complex. 
10.2307/1220077|Self-incompatibility in Solanum appears to be largely restricted to species of subgenus Potatoe, providing further support for the separation of that group from subgenus Solanum. Loss of self-incompatibility must have taken place early in the evolutionary histories of other subgenera. Possible adaptations for outcrossing, such as enantiostyly, dioecy and to a restricted degree, secondary self-incompatibility, have subsequently arisen in certain members of these predominantly self-compatible groups. The distribution of unilateral cross-incompatibility in Solanum seems to parallel that of self-incompatibility.
10.2307/1220078|A procedure has been described for interpreting the resemblance distance between objects which are represented by points in a multidimensional space, in terms of percentile radii about these points. An illustration of the procedure demonstrated its usefulness for the recognition and analysis of innate group structure.
10.2307/1220079|Taxonomy consists of three fundamentally different parts: (1) Representation, which consists of nominal, reproducible statements; (2) Ordering, which is a logical, verifiable science; and (3) Nomenclature, which is largely guided by practical application. Some proposals are made for the improvement of the scientific character of taxonomy.
10.2307/1220080|A brief review of the life of Robert Wight (1796-1872) is presented. The contribution of Wight and his effort to bring to light the flora of India, particularly of the Peninsula, are focused. The publications of Wight (65 entries) are enumerated and sometimes annotated, as a guide to their contents. Some selected references on Wight are also appended.
10.2307/1220081| [French] Cette note est la recherche du type rel de cette espce, ce qui a invitablement conduit  des investigations historiques dont les points d'interrogation ne sont pas exclus; les tudes antrieures, en particulier de SCHOTT, d'ENGLER et de HEPPER, ont  ce jour men  des interprtations diffrentes et litigieuses et  une connaissance imparfaite de la rpartition gographique de ce taxon. Le travail effectu ici doit permettre de reprendre le problme de cette espce, sur des bases plus certaines. /// Researches on the actual type of this species are made. Historic inquiries have inevitably become necessary in order to elucidate the problems involved, but it has not always been possible to eliminate each element of doubt. The previous studies on the subject, particularly the ones by SCHOTT, ENGLER and HEPPER, have led to different and controversial interpretations of this taxon and its geographical distribution. This study permits re-investigation of the taxonomy of this species on more solid grounds. 
10.2307/1220082|The taxonomic concept of E. affinis is well established historically and the epithet affinis has been fairly consistently applied to this taxon, particularly recently. Even though the original description and illustrations were, at least in part, based upon plants of E. affinis, the potential type specimens presently in the original author's herbarium consist of another distinct, and probably only distantly related species, E. alpina. As the specimen in the collector's herbarium consists of both E. affinis and E. alpina, it is concluded that the original description was based upon a mixed collection, a portion of which has since been removed. Therefore, E. affinis is lectotypified in the collector's herbarium in order to maintain the continuity established between the taxonomic concept and the epithet, in accordance with Recommendation 7B of the ICBN.
10.2307/1220083|Two divergent opinions have been expressed on the typification of Trichomanes L. Some authors select T. scandens L. as the type on the basis of the first designation of a lectotype by J. Smith in 1875, and according to the taxonomic treatment of the genus after the date of its publication by Linnaeus. Other authors designate T. crispum L. as the type on the basis of the elements studied by Linnaeus up to the time in which the genus was validly published and of the indications to be found in his publications which enable us to ascertain his intent in establishing the genus. The arguments in favour of either lectotypification are thoroughly examined and the nomenclatural consequences of the designation of T. scandens or T. crispum are envisaged. The conclusion is reached that the examination of Linnaeus's publications offers sufficient elements for an objective lectotypification of Trichomanes on T. crispum.
10.2307/1220084| The misapplication of the citation of three historically important type localities in Venezuela is noted as of frequent occurrence in monographs. The localities referred to are Colonia Tovar, collected by August Fendler, San Carlos de Ro Negro, collected by Richard Spruce, and Roraima, collected by Robert Schomburgk, the principal collectors involved in these citations. The correct localities are indicated as being in the Estado Aragua for Colonia Tovar, and Venezuela for San Carlos de Ro Negro and Roraima. 
10.2307/1220085|The use of a microwave oven to treat herbarium specimens as a means of fumigation is discussed.
10.2307/1220584|We have found two cytotypes, n = 12 and n = 13, in populations of R. luteola. The cytotype n = 12 shows great meiotic balance, while the n = 13 one presents several meiotic anomalies. We have compared R. luteola with the species of section Phyteuma L. and Resedastrum Duby of genus Reseda (since these sections, from a morphological and karyological point of view, contain the species more closely related to R.luteola), and we can observe that close relationships exist between R. luteola and R. stricta, both at the karyotype level and the seed protein profiles. These relationships suggest three possible origins for the n = 12 level of this species. Finally, we consider that the n = 13 level has been derived through an aneuploid process from n = 12 and it can be hypothesized as an evolutionary trend that this species has not yet reached stabilization.
10.2307/1220585|Cluster analysis techniques were applied to 215 grass genera using 85 morphological and microscopic characters. Clustering was run on 1) gross morphological characters, 2) microscopic characters and 3) on combination of the two. Neither the morphological nor the microscopic characters alone resulted in an appreciable grouping of the genera. The microscopic characters, however, produced clusters that better approach the present subfamilial classifications. Combination of the two subsets of characters resulted in eight clusters representing the modern subfamilies Pooideae, Oryzoideae, Panicoideae, Eragrostoideae, Arundinoideae, Centostecoideae, Bambusoideae and a new potential subfamily (Nardoideae) that included Lygeum, Nardus and Diarrhena. The tribal constituents of these subfamilies are discussed in detail. It has been concluded that classification of grasses seems more natural at the level of the subfamily than tribe.
10.2307/1220586|Within North America north of Mexico, Clematis (Ranunculaceae) consists of 30 native or introduced species which are classified into four subgenera, viz., Clematis (9 species), Atragene (L.) Torrey & Gray (2 species, Viorna A. Gray (17 species), and Viticella (Moench) Keener & Dennis, stat. nov. (2 species). In particular, the history of the names "Atragene" and "Viorna" is reviewed with special attention to the major infrageneric rank (subgenus) in Asa Gray's publications.
10.2307/1220587|The presence of specific PIIIc'f sieve-element plastids (detected by electron microscopic analysis) in Geocarpon adds further support to the inclusion of this monotypic genus in the Caryophyllaceae.
10.2307/1220588|In most groups of the angiosperms the primitive condition of apocarpy has been surpassed by syncarpy, which is a more advantageous construction in several respects. It enables (1) more regular pollen tube distribution, (2) intensified pollen tube selection, (3) higher economy of construction, (4) increased diversity of dispersal types in the fruiting stage. In primitive angiosperms there are alternative evolutionary trends exhibiting modified apocarpy or unelaborated syncarpy with some unusual differentiations (extragynoecial compitum, hyperstigma). These alternative methods share some, but not all advantages of usual elaborated syncarpy. It is supposed that, therefore, they were, like normal apocarpy, not competitive enough compared with perfect syncarpy.
10.2307/1220589|The usefulness of the cotyledonary leaf characteristics in the taxonomy of Convolvulaceae has been highlighted. Certain characters of the mature cotyledonary leaves of seedlings, such as the mean area, depth of lobing, depth of basal sinus, angle between the lobes, pattern of venation, stalk length and other features offer much scope for the taxonomists, in view of their high level of constancy. Furthermore, being quite conservative, these characters shed considerable light on the systematic relationship existing among the taxa. The cotyledonary leaves of Merremia tridentata are very similar to those of Ipomoea coptica, suggesting parallel evolution. Among the varieties of I. nil and I. batatas, there exist certain differences, while the two varieties of I. pes-tigridis register greater similarity. Evolvulus alsinoides and E. nummularius show but a slight difference in size. Cressa cretica is unique in having linear cotyledons. Cuscuta chinensis stands apart from the rest of the family, being acotyledonous, thus affording yet another reason for its segregation from Convolvulaceae. Rivea hypocrateriformis and Argyreia cuneata show similar characteristics, giving additional support in favour of the generic merger of Rivea with Argyreia.
10.2307/1220591|The nomenclatural history of Soymida febrifuga (Meliaceae) is examined and the name shown to be valid, the specific name published by Roxburgh in 1793, the generic, like several other generic names in Meliaceae, by Mirbel and Cassini in 1830, and the combination in 1832. In establishing this, other overlooked binomials were brought to light such that a new combination in Hymenodictyon (Rubiaceae) is necessary. Names published in reports of societies' proceedings are discussed with the result that Barclaya (Nymphaeaceae) becomes Hydrostemma, in which two new combinations are proposed. A list of a further 108 overlooked names of plants, principally from Eurasia, is appended. Their recognition requires that Dianthus erinaceus (Caryophyllaceae) be known as D. webbianus, and Smilax rigida (Liliaceae) becomes S. myrtilius, while one name in Pelargonium (Geraniaceae) remains obscure; the earliest name for Tulipa eichleri (Liliaceae) may be T. persica.
10.2307/1219982|The discovery of numerous fossil plants in recent years, together with the application of new techniques directed at understanding the total biology of the organism, has resulted in the modification of some ideas pertaining to the origin of land plants. Several of these lines of evidence strongly suggest the presence of a diverse terrestrial flora significantly earlier than the Upper Silurian bench mark currently used for the first appearance of plants with vascular tissue.
10.2307/1219983|Following a review of previous classifications, a revised scheme is presented for the 155 genera of Pooideae, derived via numerical analyses of original and compiled morphological and anatomical data and consideration of additional evidence. The subfamily is divided into two newly described supertribes, Poanae and Triticanae. These are further subdivided into the following tribes, all fully described: Poeae, Seslerieae, Meliceae, Aveneae and Agrostideae (in Poanae) and Triticeae, Bromeae and Brachypodieae (in Triticanae). The Aveneae are more narrowly circumscribed than is usual. The data employed in the numerical analyses are available, on microfiche, as full English descriptions.
10.2307/1219984|Preparatory to the use of volatile oils in systematic studies of Australian rainforest trees, a number of different techniques for handling volatile oil data are reviewed. Compared are two different schemes of character weighting (unweighted and F-weighted), three different schemes of standardisation (unstandardised, standardisation by range, standardisation by standard deviation), and three different distance measures (Squared Euclidean Distance, Euclidean Distance, Manhattan Metric distance). It is determined empirically that, for volatile oil data, where weighting is both possible and valid, a combination of standardisation and weighting proves most effective; on the other hand, if weighting is not possible, standardisation should not be undertaken. Euclidean Distance and Manhattan Metric distance prove to be the best distance measures.
10.2307/1219985|An outline and index to supplement Takhtajan's 1980 classification of flowering plants is presented.
10.2307/1219986|Epiblast length and shape were examined in 39 species of the Stipeae, 29 of which are native to North America. In most species of Stipa examined the epiblast equalled or exceeded the coleoptile and was acute with or without a small V-shaped notch at the apex. In contrast, in most species of Oryzopsis the epiblast extended no more than three-quarters of the way up the coleoptile and was more or less truncate. Two other characters that tended to differ between Stipa and Oryzopsis were the overall shape of the embryo as seen in ventral view and the position of the tip of the coleorhiza. In Oryzopsis the embryo tended to be broader (length/width 1.0-1.6) than in Stipa (length/width 1.5-3.7) and the tip of the coleorhiza higher with respect to the base of the embryo. Some taxonomically significant variation was seen within each genus. The species of Stipa sect. Hesperostipa are distinguished by a deep, parallel-sided apical notch. The placement of S. webberi and S. hendersonii in Stipa rather than Oryzopsis was supported by the characters considered here. The two species of Nassella examined were stipoid in their epiblast characters, but their over-all shape and the position of the coleorhiza were oryzopsoid. The only species of Piptochaetium examined, P. pringlei, was typically stipoid in the characters examined.
10.2307/1219987|A palynological study of Achatocarpus Triana and Phaulothamnus A. Gray utilizing structural data from transmission electron microscopy (TEM), reinforces their close relationship as suggested by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and supports family status as Achatocarpaceae. Both genera are known to have the betalain pigments and protein-type sieve tube plastid which characterize the order Centrospermae. Affinities within the Centrospermae remain uncertain.
10.2307/1219988|The characters used in a recent phylogenetic analysis of land plants to derive the "Gneticae" and flowering plants from a common ancestor are critically evaluated. In our opinion, these characters are not homologous in the two groups and cannot be used in such a fashion. A cladistic analysis of seed plants (or land plants) is a worthwhile endeavor, but requires careful consideration of the homologous nature of the characters that are utilized in such an analysis.
10.2307/1219989| Ultrastructural features of the flagellar apparatus in green algae and land plants seem to be of considerable phylogenetic significance. Based on functional considerations details of the flagellar apparatus can be used to construct tentative lines of evolution within the green algae. An "ancestral" asymmetric zooflagellate possibly gave rise to a green unicell after a primary endosymbiotic event involving a green prokaryote. During the transition from phagotrophic to phototrophic nutrition in most green algae (the Chlorophyceae and Ulvaphyceae sensu Stewart & Mattox and most Prasinophyceae sensu Christensen) the original asymmetric flagellar apparatus was transformed into a 180 rotational symmetric flagellar apparatus with 4 flagella and a flagellar root system of the X-2-X-2-type. Most significant in this transition was presumably the evolution of the phototactic apparatus and of an apical flagellar groove. In the Charophyceae sensu Stewart & Mattox (including those green algae related to the ancestry of the archegoniate land plants) the early transition towards a terrestrial life, lack of an eyespot apparatus and development of a special type of oogamy possibly led to the evolution of the unilateral flagellar root in these organisms. It is suggested that the evolution of the unilateral MLS-root in the Charophyceae sensu Stewart & Mattox can be traced back to an "ancestral green flagellate" before the evolution of the typical X-2-X-2 flagellar root system. A tentative evolutionary scheme of the green algae mainly based on motile cell structure and mitotic and cytokinetic mechanisms is presented. 
10.2307/1219990|A procedure has been described for evaluating linkage between objects which are represented by points in a multi-dimensional space in terms of overlap between replicates. An illustration of the procedure demonstrated its usefulness for the recognition and analysis of innate group structure.
10.2307/1219991|A modified polyclave keying method is described which employs one card per character rather than character state. This can allow a great reduction in the total number of cards required for keying, along with a lessened need to keep the cards carefully sorted. This allows practical field use of the key. The keying deck is an attribute type with up to 78 taxa and 10 character states or 156 taxa and 5 character states per card. Identifications are made by overlapping the character cards on an identification board. Additional cards or decks are required when the number of character states is greater than 10 (or five in the 156 taxa version) or the number of taxa exceeds 78 (156 in the larger version).

10.2307/1219993| During the recent Universidad de Concepcin--Ohio State University expeditions to the Juan Fernandez Islands, observations were made concerning recent changes in the composition and extent of the native flora. In comparison with the data of Skottsberg from 1916-17, many of the endemic species have become much rarer, and some perhaps extinct. Several especially aggressive introduced species, e.g., Acaena argentea, Aristotelia chilensis, and Rubus ulmifolius, continue to invade and replace the native vegetation. Increasing areas of dry habitats and increasing proportions of xeromorphic or lithophilic plants now characterize the total vegetation. The total area of native vegetation is now restricted to the central ridges and cliffs. The major causes for the floristic degradation appear to be the introduced animals which have overgrazed and trampled the plants as well as compacted the soil. This has lead to erosion and further loss or degradation of the plant cover. 
10.2307/1219994|The characteristics of the lectotype of Stipa columbiana Macoun are reviewed in detail and shown to include those generally considered diagnostic of the species S. lemmonii (Vasey) Scribner but not those diagnostic of S. columbiana auct. Thus the name S. columbiana Macoun must either be rejected, as proposed earlier or, because it has priority, applied to the species now known as S. lemmonii. The characteristics of the lectotype of S. viridula var. minor Vasey, which is the basionym of S. occidentalis var. minor (Vasey) C. L. Hitchc., are also reviewed and shown to demonstrate that the specimen belongs to S. lettermanii Vasey, not S. columbiana auct.
10.2307/1219995| Abbotia araneosa Perestenko is transferred to Neodilsea (Dumontiaceae, Cryptonemiales) pending post-fertilization studies. The genus name is antedated by Abbotia Rafinesque (Juncaginaceae) and Abbottia F. von Mller (Rubiaceae). 
10.2307/1219996| Jos Jernimo Triana was one of the most important collectors in 19th Century Colombia. The history of his collection and its numbering after his active period of collecting are traced. He employed a dual numbering system and prepared two separate catalogues for his collection. The set now at the Instituto de Ciencias Naturales, Universidad Nacional, Bogot (COL) is numbered systematically, and the sets deposited in European herbaria, particularly the British Museum (Natural History) (BM), are numbered serially from 1 to 4490. Consequently many important cited duplicates and types of Triana's collections at COL are not indicated as such; 26 previously unrecognized type collections of Triana Rubiaceae at COL are presented. Some collections in the Triana herbarium may actually be Linden duplicates. 
10.2307/1220001| The 41 new species of Solanum published in the Encyclopdie Mthodique, Botanique, Supplment 3, 1814, should be ascribed solely to M. F. Dunal who provided the diagnoses and epithets, and not to the editor, J. L. M. Poiret. 
10.2307/1220002| Protopteridium Krej (1880) is validly published and has priority over Milleria Lang (1926) and Rellimia Leclercq and Bonamo (1973). Ptilophyton thomsonii Dawson (1878) is not the type species of Ptilophyton and when synonymized with the plants described by Krej, Lang and Leclercq and Bonamo becomes Protopteridium thomsonii (Dawson) Krusel and Weyland (1933). 
10.2307/1220003| Authorities have disagreed on the correct name for the widespread and common species known variously as Dryopteris paleacea (Swartz or Don) Hand.-Mazz. or C. Chr. and D. wallichiana (Spreng.) Hyl. Rexamination of Don's "Prodromus Florae Nepalensis" forces the conclusion that Alston was correct in using the latter name. 
10.2307/1220004|The type specimen of Gutierrezia linearifolia Lag., type species of the genus, has been either lost or destroyed; no known duplicate material exists. A neotype has been chosen, based on what can be deduced about the original collection locality, since direct evidence is lacking.
10.2307/1220005| The sheet bearing the type specimen of Cercidium floridum Bentham ex Gray in the Herbarium, School of Botany, Trinity College, Dublin, collected by Thomas Coulter (no. 489, Sonora Alta, Mexico in 1830) includes two small flowering twigs of C. floridum and one leafless branch of C. praecox (Ruiz & Pavn) Harms bearing young legumes. Except in the matter of number of leaflets per pinna (3-jugate), the Latin description could apply to any of these. Cercidium floridum leaflets are usually 3-jugate while those of C. praecox are usually 5-9 jugate. The lower right-hand flowering twig on the Coulter sheet is designated as LECTOTYPE. Two Coulter specimens at Kew, annotated by Bentham as C. floridum are C. praecox. 
10.2307/1220006|The so-called Caspian Locust is morphologically so closely related to Gleditsia horrida (Thunb.) Miq. from Japan that it has been considered by C. K. Schneider merely as a variety of the latter. Legumes of both taxa were compared without finding differences. It is pointed out that laterally setose legumes as that figured recently by Dudik, do not occur in G. horrida. The area of distribution, both present and past, of relict laurel-type forests is discussed with the conclusion that G. caspia Desf. is best regarded as a subspecies of G. horrida; three necessary new combinations are made in an Appendix.
10.2307/1220670|The new genus Rollinsia is described and its relationships and position within the tribe Thelypodieae is discussed. A single species, R. paysonii, is recognized.
10.2307/1220671|Research projects in systematic botany reviewed and recommended for support by the National Science Foundation Systematic Biology Program in fiscal years 1980 and 1981 are described. These 104 projects include three studies primarily concerned with phenomena rather than taxa, 28 monographs or revisions, 46 characterizing various aspects of selected taxa, 24 inventories, and three service functions.
10.2307/1220672|Study of two species of Pterocephalus and three of Scabiosa shows that wood of Dipsacaceae is unusual, compared with families claimed to be allied to it, in having several primitive features. All species of the present study have tracheids, rather than libriform fibers, as the imperforate tracheary element type. Vestigial perforation plates are common in Pterocephalus dumetorum secondary xylem and occur in primary xylem of all species. Wood anatomy (especially that of rays) shows that the family is probably primitively woody, perhaps shrubby. Wood features are related to the dry mediterranean-type climates in which the species studied occur.
10.2307/1220673|Floristic similarities among 51 geographic regions in 7 superregions of the Soviet Union were analyzed using distributonal data of 736 species of the Brassicaceae. Due to the high number of species, they were grouped into 9 tribes before analysis. Principal components revealed that different superregions occupied different but understandable parts of reduced character space, and possessed different shapes in that space. Floristic form, analogous to organic form and its components of size and shape, was introduced as a useful concept. Finally, similarities (based on their geographic distributions) among the 9 tribes of the Brassicaceae were presented and discussed.
10.2307/1220676| Observations on living plants of Hydromystria laevigata found in an Argentinian site (Prov. Crdoba); a report on the germination of the seeds is also included, together with a short discussion on the differences between the monotypic genus Hydromystria and Limnobium, its boreal counterpart, also monotypic (L. spongia). 
10.2307/1220677|Among the plants occupying eight island groups outlying from New Zealand, there are three evolutionary patterns. (1) The commonest pattern involves long-distance dispersal to one or more outlying archipelagos and the differentiation of a single derivative taxon. (2) Less commonly, dispersal to more than one island group has been followed by divergence between the distant archipelagos; various stages of allopatric speciation are represented. (3) In a few plant groups endemic to the Chatham Islands, there has been evolutionary divergence among islets within the archipelago. Cotula featherstonii provides an example. Plants from four islets were grown; they belong to three distinguishable races. The three races correspond to the three land masses present during the last glacial maximum (ca. 20,000 years B.P.).
10.2307/1220679|Villarsia capitata, a diploid annual of Western Australia, has distylous flowers. Results of a crossing program indicate that its distyly is associated with an incompatibility system. Intramorph pollinations produced 0.4-0.8 seeds per pollination; intermorph pollinations produced 10.2 seeds per pollination in pins and 3.3 in thrums. About sixty percent of pin ovules and twenty percent of thrum ovules mature to seed following intermorph pollinations. These differences may result from the smaller size of thrum stigmas, from greater difficulty in transferring pollen to thrum stigmas in artificial pollinations, or from unknown causes. Villarsia capitata is a highly specialized member of the genus in its capitate, bracteate inflorescences and its annual habit, yet it retains a breeding system that is primitive in the Menyanthaceae.
10.2307/1220681|Darwin's notes on his plants collected on the voyage of H. M. S. Beagle (1831-36) have been misplaced since the mid-19th century. Unavailability of the notes has caused problems with the identification of his plants, and has fostered a lack of appreciation in the botanical aspects of the voyage. I report here on their rediscovery at the Cambridge University Herbarium, along with notes on the plants by J. S. Henslow and J. D. Hooker. Comparison of the Plant Notes with those for the groups of animals collected shows that they were compiled for the specialists who were to identify the specimens involved.
10.2307/1220682| Cardenolides (cardiac glycosides) are reported for the first time from wild-collected material of Erysimum native to North America. For two seed samples of wild origin and for 24 leaf samples from greenhouse-grown plants, total cardenolide content was determined by spectrophotometric assay in reactions with 2,2,4,4-tetranitrodiphenyl. Qualitative composition was studied by TLC in two solvent systems. Variation in concentrations and in arrays of compounds among populations suggests that cardenolide profiles may provide useful chemotaxonomic characters. Cardenolides are also likely to be important in mediating plant-herbivore interactions in the genus Erysimum. 
10.2307/1220683|The flowers of Krameria have been misunderstood since they were first described by Loefling in 1758. Some of the misconceptions about the flowers stemmed from the failure of authors to recognize the organography of the two fleshy structures which flank the ovary. Other misinterpretations resulted from confusion about the orientation of the flowers. Twice the controversy as to whether or not the flowers of Krameria species are resupinate was raised and laid to rest, but doubts still linger. Recent morphological and anatomical studies have unequivocably shown that the flowers are not resupinate and that the three small petals are adaxial. The two abaxial petals are highly modified into the two fleshy structures that have only recently been explained. Within the last five years it has been shown that these petals are glandular and play an intricate role in the pollination biology of Krameria by secreting lipids that are collected by female bees of the genus Centris (Anthophoridae). A survey of the anatomy and morphology of the glandular petals, or elaiophores, has yielded a suite of characters that are useful in showing branching patterns within the genus because they show a sequence of specializations of the outer elaiophore surface from elongate, irregular patches of secretory cells over the entire surface covered by a cuticle that separates smoothly from the cells as oils accumulate beneath it, to either small, round or polygonal patches of secretory cells over the entire surface, or to restrictions of the secretory tissue to the distal portion of the fleshy petal. The trends in specializations of the secretory surfaces of the glandular petals show correlations with trends based on sepal arrangement, degree of fusion of the superior petals, and pollen morphology.

10.2307/1220685| The status of the Brazilian genus Kleinodendron Smith and Downs is reconsidered on the basis of studies of floral morphology, pollen characters, and wood anatomy. The plant does not belong to the tribe Clutieae but rather to the tribe Phyllantheae, and the genus cannot be separated from the genus Savia. Although there are some differences between the specimens of Kleinodendron from Santa Catarina and material of Savia dictyocarpa Muell. Arg. from Rio de Janeiro and So Paulo, the Santa Catarina populations are not sharply separable, and both the genus Kleinodendron and the species Kleinodendron riosulense must pass into synonymy.

10.2307/1219679| [French] La taxonomie numrique est rarement utilise pour comparer les familles de plantes entre elles. Ceci est probablement d au fait qu'il est difficile d'organiser les caractres de faon  bien exprimer la variabilit qui existe souvent  ce niveau taxonomique. Afin de contourner cet obstacle nous avons utilise la frquence des caractres  l'intrieur de la famille. L'tude porte sur la sous-classe des Hamamelididae, sensu Takhtajan (1969), qui comprend 22 familles. Pour la plupart des familles, 130 caractres morphologiques et anatomiques ont t recenss. La frquence d'un caractre, dans chaque famille, est obtenue en calculant le pourcentage de genres qui possdent le caractre en question. Les donnes furent traites selon 2 mthodes: la mthode des groupements par agglomration hirarchique et l'analyse en coordonnes principales. Le coefficient de similarit utilise est celui de Gower (1971). Cette analyse montre que la sous-classe des Hamamelididae se subdivise phntiquement en trois groupes assez bien dlimits. Le groupe 1 comprend des familles dites primitives, Eupteleaceae, Tetracentraceae, Trochodendraceae, Myrothamnaceae, Cercidiphyllaceae, Platanaceae, Hamamelidaceae, et est souvent vu comme faisant le lien avec les autres sous-classes. Les familles du groupe 3, Myricaceae, Moraceae, Ulmaceae, Betulaceae, Fagaceae, Juglandaceae, Rhoipteleaceae, Urticaceae, Cannabaceae, se distinguent plutt par des caractres volus et forment le noyau des Amentifres. Le groupe 2, qui comprend les familles Casuarinaceae, Eucommiaceae, Balanopaceae, Didymelaceae, Leitneriaceae et Barbeyaceae, ne semblent pas possder de caractres particuliers. Ces familles possdent, pour la plupart, un ensemble de caractres qui se trouvent principalement soit dans le groupe 1, soit dans le groupe 3 ou les deux  la fois. Voil pourquoi, il runit des familles phntiquement intermdiaires entre celles du groupe 1 et du groupe 3. Cette tude indique aussi que les Balanopaceae se rapproche davantage du complexe Trochodendrales-Hamamelidales que des Fagales. De plus, il semble que les Leitneriaceae, tout en tant prs des Amentifres, s'insrent plus ou moins directement entre ce groupe et les Hamamelidales. Les rsultats obtenus concordent sensiblement avec certains systmes de classification modernes et plus particulirement avec celui propos par Takhtajan, si l'on fait abstraction de la position des Balanopaceae et des Leitneriaceae. /// Numerical taxonomy is rarely used to compare plant families with one another. This is probably because it is very difficult to organize characters in such a way as to totally express the variability at this rank. To avoid this problem, we evaluated the frequency of the character in the family, by calculating the percentage of genera possessing the character in question. The study was done on the subclass Hamamelididae, sensu Takhtajan (1969), which comprises 22 families. For most of the families, 130 morphological and anatomical characters were used to obtain values. The data were treated by principal coordinate analysis and by hierarchic agglomeration cluster analyses. These two types of analysis were built upon Gower (1971) similarity coefficient. The analyses of the ordination and the phenogram has permitted us to divide the subclass Hamamelididae into three well-delimited phenetic groups. The first group comprises the socalled primitive families: Eupteleaceae, Tetracentraceae, Trochodendraceae, Myrothamnaceae, Cercidiphyllaceae, Platanaceae, Hamamelidaceae, and is often seen as the basis for linkage with other subclasses. The families of group three, Myricaceae, Moraceae, Ulmaceae, Betulaceae, Fagaceae, Juglandaceae, Rhoipteleaceeae, Urticaceae and Cannabaceae, distinguish themselves by evolved characters and can be considered as the nucleus of the Amentiferae. The second group which comprises Casuarinaceae, Eucommiaceae, Balanopaceae, Didymelaceae, Leitneriaceae and Barbeyaceae, does not seem to possess any unique characters. These families possess characters that are found either in group one or group three or in both. This explains why the second group is made up of families which are phenetically intermediate between groups one and three. This study shows also that the Balanopaceae presents more affinities with the Trochodendrales-Hamamelidales complex than the Fagales. Also, it seems that the Leitneriaceae although close to the Amentiferae, more or less insert themselves between that group and the Hamamelidales. The results obtained concord well with several modern classification systems and particularly with the one proposed by Takhtajan (1969) except for the positions in which he places the Leitneriaceae and the Balanopaceae. 
10.2307/1219680|Principal component analysis (PCA), Wells' hybrid distance diagram, principal coordinate analysis (PCO) using weighted Gower metrics, and canonical variate analysis (CVA) were compared using data from artificial crosses of sunfish (Lepomis) and putative hybridization in Juniperus. The results were similar between the two data sets in that using the weighted characters (F ratios from ANOVA of the parents) produced well resolved parental groups and generally ordinated the hybrids between the parents. The F weighted PCO and Wells' distance diagrams were found to be better suited for the analysis of hybridization than PCA or CVA. Several limitations of PCA and CVA are discussed.
10.2307/1219681|A Monte Carlo procedure is described for identifying linkage between objects each of which is represented as the multivariate centroid of a group of replicates. An example of an application of this procedure to a study of geographic variation demonstrates the usefulness of the procedure for the recognition of innate group structure.
10.2307/1219682|Solanum appendiculatum H. et B. ex Dun., S. connatum Corr., and S. inscendens Rydb. constitute the single dioecious species, S. appendiculatum. These taxa are fully intercompatible and morphologically very similar. They were distinguished by differences in style length and in the degree of filament fusion; however, the first character is associated with the gender of the plants, and the latter shows variability and inheritance patterns not associated with species boundaries.
10.2307/1219684|Mathematical analysis of the flavonoid pattern of twenty populations of Lathyrus pratensis shows that there is no difference between diploid and tetraploid samples in flavonoid metabolism. But we noted obvious differences between the populations growing in a wet habitat and those growing in a dry one, the flavonoid biosynthesis evolution of these being more advanced. Moreover, in both diploids and tetraploids, the hypothesis of ancestors from different geographical origins is reinforced by slight variations in the flavonoid metabolism expression on the samples studied.
10.2307/1219685| About 2000 watercolor paintings, made by the artists of the 18th-century Spanish expedition to New Spain, and lost since 1820, were found in Barcelona and acquired by the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation, Pittsburgh. They will constitute an important resource for those hoping to fix the identities of the species of plants described by A. P. de Candolle on the basis of these paintings and the duplicate set at the Conservatoire Botanique, Genve. 
10.2307/1219686| Jos Celestino Mutis was one of the most important of the early botanists in Colombia. One of his few publications was "El Arcano de la Quina" which appeared in the "Papel Peridico de Santaf de Bogot", a small-format weekly newspaper, between the 10th of May, 1793, and the 7th of February, 1794. In a table which appeared on page 465 of issue 111, 11 October 1793, he validly published four species of Cinchona, C. lancifolia, C. oblongifolia, C. cordifolia and C. ovalifolia. 
10.2307/1219687|The use of mixed collections has become widespread in moss taxonomy as a short-cut for more rigorous examination of the genetic basis of morphological characters. The reasoning behind this approach is that closely related but morphologically different plants growing inter-mixed must be experiencing the same environment. Therefore, the morphs must be genetically distinct and can be treated as separate taxa. The method is simple to apply and has been extended from field observations of mixed populations to mixed specimens in herbarium packets. There are serious problems with the logic and methodology of this approach. It overlooks the possibility of microenvironmental variation and requires unreasonably restrictive assumptions about genetic variability in bryophyte populations. The mixed collection method should be abandoned entirely, and more rigorous experimental tests, such as uniform garden cultivation and reciprocal field transplants, employed.
10.2307/1219688|A bibliographic summary of "Acta Phytotaxonomica Sinica" is presented. Publication dates, numbers per volume and other pertinent information were determined in part from an examination of holdings in the Institute of Botany, Academia Sinica, Beijing.
10.2307/1219694|In this paper the author presents the results of his search in an attempt to establish a lectotype of Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer. Panax ginseng, a very important Far Eastern economic plant, was described in 1842. At the time of the description C. A. Meyer, the author of the species, did not designate the type specimen, although he mentioned all plant material which he used in establishing this taxon. In addition, he supplied his description with illustrations. On the basis of the existing evidence, this author believes that Meyer's illustrations, as an element selected from the original material can be designated as the lectotype of the Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer.

10.2307/1219698|The lectotype of Phlox ovata L., a Plukenet illustration proposed by Wherry (1955), is shown to be based on a specimen of Ruellia caroliniensis (Walter) Steudel (Acanthaceae). This lectotypification must stand even though specimens of P. ovata were present in the Linnaean Herbarium. Wherry considered the two elements and purposefully selected a Plukenet illustration as the type of the species. The Allegheny Phlox must now be called P. latifolia Michx. Also, the type of P. setacea L. is shown not to be a synonym of P. subulata L. var. subulata, but representative of the southern phase which Wherry (1929) called var. australis. The type of P. setacea is probably a John Banister collection from Virginia. The name, P. subulata var. setacea (L.) Brand (1907) has priority over var. australis Wherry.
10.2307/1219700|A case is made for rejecting the proposal (520) for conserving Notodanthonia Zotov (1963). It is suggested that the lectotypification of Plinthanthesis by Blake (1972) stand. Monostachya is recognized as a distinct genus with four new species (three new combinations) and a new combination is made in Chionochloa.
10.2307/1219846|In the Asteraceae, the two most taxonomically significant aspects of the sesquiterpene lactone chemistry are the patterns of skeletal and substitutional diversity. Sesquiterpene lactones can be subdivided into different classes based on their carbon skeletons. Superimposed on each skeleton is a set of substituents which collectively define a specific compound. Both skeletal classes and substitutional features display taxonomically useful patterns of distribution. A cladistic technique is demonstrated for converting these chemical features into taxonomic characters. Each character is derived via a biosynthetically based evaluation of structural diversity and determination of structural homology. Each set of homologous skeletal and substitutional characters from a taxon is arranged in a biogenetic transformation series. Outgroup comparison is used to determine the polarity of each character transformation series. The distribution of the resulting novel (apomorphic) skeletal and substitutional characters within this taxon are then used to generate a cladogram depicting the chemical synapomorphies. The chemistries of the taxa, Tetragonotheca L. and Iva L. (Asteraceae: Heliantheae), provide the two examples for the four-step cladistic analysis. The methods employed in this analysis of sesquiterpene lactone distribution may also be applicable to other classes of complex natural products.
10.2307/1219848|Populations of Juniperus scopulorum were sampled throughout its range and the steam volatile terpenoids removed for chemosystematic study. Canonical variate analysis revealed three major trends: isolation of the Puget Sound--Vancouver Island populations for a considerable time; differentiation of populations from northern Mexico dating to pre-Pleistocene (?); and a possible Pleistocene refugium in eastern Oregon for the (re)colonization of the glaciated British Columbian populations of J. scopulorum. Pleistocene glaciopluvial periods are reviewed as to their effects on vegetation and past distributions of J. scopulorum. Hybridization and introgression of J. scopulorum with J. horizontalis and J. virginiana is examined in light of both the present and past distributions of these taxa. Interspecific relationships are also examined between J. scopulorum, J. blancoi, J. horizontalis, and J. virginiana.
10.2307/1219849|The development of an optical-scan data encoding system at the University of Georgia Herbarium is discussed. Procedures have been developed which will allow encoding of the 80-90 thousand sheets of the flora of Georgia housed at GA. The system is currently in operation.

10.2307/1219850|Problems in the taxonomy of Botrychium (Ophioglossaceae) are outlined and discussed. Species interpretation has been controversial because many taxa are little known, poorly collected, highly variable, and subtly differentiated. A method of study based upon the tendency of the species to coexist with each other in the same habitats is discussed, and examples from our field work are given. The "Genus Community Method" and the related "Mutual Associates Method" allow critical comparisons to be made. Cohabitation of two or more species without successful interbreeding demonstrates biological discreteness and confirms that the character differences are most likely genetically fixed. A summary of our knowledge of what pairs of species have been found to co-exist is given for subg. Sceptridium and subg. Botrychium. For the former, the major associations occur in eastern North America and tropical America north of Panama, including the Antilles. For the latter, the major associations occur in western North America. As many as seven species may grow together in one habitat. We conclude that the genus may not be as difficult taxonomically as previously believed. By discovering and analyzing genus communities of Botrychium, we can show which taxa are consistently and persistently distinct.
10.2307/1219851| The initial use of the name Mnium in the generic sense contained not only species of mosses but two liverworts as well, namely, M. trichomanis L. and M. fissum L. These hepatic species, now regarded as validly published in accordance with the I.C.B.N., have long been recognized as segregates within the genus Calypogeja Raddi. Although lectotypes had been selected for these two taxa sometime ago, those specimens are at odds with the original protologue of Linnaeus and must be superseded. Further, study of authentic specimens of the taxa in question reveals that neither name has been used in the sense of the original author and they are proposed here as nomina rejicienda under Art. 69. If rejected, a new name would be needed to accommodate those elements previously referred to as Calypogeja fissa sensu Raddi et auct. div. which is unequivocally shown to be the equivalent of M. trichomanis L. Additionally C. fissa sensu the Linnaean basionym, is shown to be conspecific with C. arguta Mont. et Nees which could then replace C. fissa as the earliest legitimate name available. Calypogeja trichomanis sensu Mller and modern authors is regarded as a species nova (C. azurea Stotl. et Crotz) since it cannot be correlated with any previous legitimate name.

All ten instalment covers bore the title "Genera et species palmarum", even though the tenth instalment included the title pages with the definitive title. The contents of all instalments are made clear, apparently for the first time, from the complete collection of their covers in the "Laboratoire de Phanrogamie", Paris. The tenth instalment seems to have been out in 1850. 
10.2307/1219855|Brief biographies of E. Lepage and A. Dutilly, two major botanical explorers in northern Canada and Alaska. Summary of their botanical itineraries. Brief description of their herbaria and their successive locations.
10.2307/1219862|Ipomoea imperati (Vahl) Grisebach is the correct name for the currently accepted name Ipomoea stolonifera J. F. Gmelin. Lectotypes of Convolvulus sinuatus Petagna and C. imperati Vahl are designated.
10.2307/1219863|Linnaeus based the name Polygonum maritimum in Species Plantarum on two specimens: the first, labeled "Monspelii et in Italia," is kept in Burser's herbarium (UPS); the second, on which is written: "Virginia," is among Linnaeus' specimens in Stockholm (S). Linnaeus, however, classified both the European specimen (UPS) and the American one (S) as P. maritimum, considering them to be both the same species. Actually, only the European specimen is attributable to P. maritimum, while the American one is P. glaucum Nutt. According to current usage, there is no doubt that the name P. maritimum refers to the European species and therefore, according to I.C.B.N. (Art. 7, Rec. 7B, 51 and 53), I have selected as lectotype of P. maritimum the specimen in Burser's herbarium (UPS).
10.2307/1219864|Vasey (1893b) was correct in selecting Suksdorf's Mt. Adams, Washington specimen as lectotype of Festuca viridula. Piper (1906) misinterpreted the protologue in Vasey (1893a) and his selection of a superseding lectotype (Bolander, California) does not stand.
10.2307/1219869|Rheede named 12 Araceae in his Hortus Malabaricus. Commentaries on the identifications, meanings, etc. of these names which fall under 11 accepted taxa, are given along with the types and distribution of their current names.
10.2307/1221968|The male flower of Hedyosmum (Chloranthaceae) has been described by all authors for almost two centuries as unistaminate, naked, and ebracteate. It is not so at all, but a flower that bears up to several hundred stamens, spirally arranged along an axis. It is an extraordinary structure in the angiosperms, precisely a gymnosperm cone-like male flower and closely associated with many other primitive characters (in particular the pollen that is known by a similar monosulcate type as early as the lower Cretaceous time). Hence, there is a very strong probability in favour of the primitiveness of this structure, and its adaptation, which seems to be wind pollination. In particular, the Hedyosmum stamen is considered here not according to the general view as a reduced flower, but as a transformed bract. The female flower pattern is like the male one, but more reduced; it theoretically is an axis with several phyllomes, one of which being the carpel, the others, fused with one another and with the ovary, representing the (generally trimerous) perianth which is homologous to the more or less fused sterile phyllomes at the bottom of the male flower. The partial female inflorescence is basically an ordinary spike and the male one a cyme, but there are reasons for believing that the two inflorescence patterns are closely related with one another. There is a "spectacular" evolutionary trend from the common ancestor of both Hedyosmum and Ascarina (another Chloranthaceae), the latter genus being possibly insect-pollinated and having male flowers only 1-5-staminate. The new interpretation of the Hedyosmum flower reported here leads me to think very seriously that some (many?) angiosperm trends must have had a chloranthoid origin.
10.2307/1221969|The pollen of seven collections representing three of the four species of Corynocarpus (the only genus in the family) has been examined in LM and SEM, and one species examined in TEM. If the colpi are meridionally oriented, then the pollen of Corynocarpaceae is weakly heteropolar, 2-colporate, with a mostly psilate exine, and an unstratified or poorly differentiated exine structure. This highly distinctive pollen has no known counterpart in either the Celastrales or Ranunculales, two orders to which the family has been assigned. Corynocarpus pollen is similar to that of the saxifragaceous genus Itea, which is also illustrated in SEM and TEM.
10.2307/1221970| It has been shown previously that 45 species of Alyssum (Cruciferae), found on serpentine soils, can accumulate nickel to levels above 1000 g/g (on a dry mass basis). An investigation of most species of the Old World genera of Tribus Alysseae has now demonstrated that this remarkable nickel accumulation is exhibited by five additional serpentine taxa from Turkey and the Balkans: Alyssum peltarioides subsp. virgatiforme, Bornmuellera glabrescens, B. baldaccii, B. tymphaea, and the hybrid B.  petri. All of these taxa had maximum nickel concentrations in the range 1.0-3.1%. Additional data are presented for Alyssum species, including some for taxa not previously reported. Although adaptation by plant species to unfavourable edaphic factors may take place in a relatively short time, it is noteworthy that all species so far recognised as nickel accumulators are from regions that were beyond the maximum advance of the Pleistocene ice-caps. These plants may therefore represent a type of behaviour which started to evolve prior to the most recent glacial episodes. Possible reasons for the endemism of many of the nickel accumulators are outlined. 
10.2307/1221971|Several substantial databases exist for monographic data but little progress has been made towards floristic databases. For the latter, a scheme for comparable description of diverse taxa is needed. The creation and use of such a scheme is described here, with a pilot database constructed from representatives of the families in the flora of Great Britain. It is possible for data on taxa to be collected efficiently using a questionnaire program, hence avoiding the problem of having to search long lists of characters from which only a few can be recorded. It appears that the approach is practical and may lead to a new kind of standard for taxonomic descriptions.
10.2307/1221972|Augustin Augier, an obscure scientist from Lyon, published in 1801 a detailed "Arbre botanique," a tree-like diagram that depicted the natural relationships he believed to exist among members of the plant kingdom. He attempted to produce a natural classification based on several parts of the flower, rather than on a single one, that would also function like a key. The botanical tree was the result, and Augier described in considerable detail the methodology that he used to produce this tree, a way of representing natural relationships distinctly uncommon at the time. Augier used the botanical tree to distinguish between different kinds of relationships, two of which are similar to those currently called homology and analogy. It is suggested that Augier's botanical tree is an example in miniature of some of the major changes that were shortly to transform early ninteenth century systematics.
10.2307/1221973|The nomenclature of the common north-temperate beech bark fungus, which also occurs on oak twigs, is reviewed. It has a pleomorphic life cycle and changes in the Code effected at the Sydney Congress in Arts. 10, 13 and 59 affect its nomenclature. It is concluded that the correct generic name for the teleomorph is Ascodichaena Butin, and that for the anamorph is Polymorphum Chev. (syn. Dichaena Fr.). The correct species name for the teleomorph is Ascodichaena rugosa Butin (syn. Lichen rugosus L.), while the name Polymorphum quercinum (Pers.) Chev. is to be applied to the anamorph. All generic and specific epithets are reviewed and revised synonymies presented. In the course of this study it was discovered that the name Opegrapha vulgata (Ach.) Ach. was illegitimate and must be referred to A. rugosa; the correct name for this common lichen was not investigated. The name Dichaenopsis notarisii Paoli was based on stromata of A. rugosa invaded by the Stagonospora-like anamorph of Keissleriella bavarica Butin.
10.2307/1221976|A food storage organ, the trophopod, is described from a number of North American ferns. It consists of the enlarged and modified leaf base filled with starch storage tissue.
10.2307/1221985|The name Nemalion is a Second Declension neuter word with the stem Nemalio-, not a Third Declension masculine word with the stem Nemalion-. The stems of all suprageneric names based on Nemalion are correct as published, except Nemalionales, which is correctable to Nemaliales.
10.2307/1221986|The amended Art. 19 Prop. C, passed at the Nomenclature Section of the XIII International Botanical Congress in Sydney, mandating that an autonym will automatically acquire priority over the name of an equivalent rank which established it (herein called the Demoulin Rule) has unforeseen ramifications on nomenclatural stability and radically alters past understandings of priority. Hundreds if not thousands of new combinations will have to be proposed since most workers using the modern codes heretofore have not considered autonyms to have priority. Application of the new Article 19 to the genus Eriogonum (Polygonaceae) is presented.
10.2307/1221998|It is shown that because Linnaeus' concept of the name Ononis spinosa L. Species Plantarum 2: 716 (1753) changed substantially between publication and 1767, it is impossible to typify the name in accordance with present usage. Accordingly, it is proposed that the name be designated a nomen rejiciendum under Article 69 of the ICBN. The correct name for the species currently known as Ononis spinosa L. then becomes O. campestris G. Koch.
10.2307/1221999|Consequences of acceptance of Proposal 449 (Veldkamp, 1978) as recommended by the Committee for Spermatophyta (Brummitt, 1982).--The name "Alternanthera ficoidea (L.) P. Beauv." is rejected, implying--under the Sydney Code--simultaneous rejection of its assumed basionym Gomphrena ficoidea L. as originally intended by the proposer (Veldkamp, 1981). In a similar way it affects some eight other combinations based thereon (enumerated by Veldkamp, 1978, p. 313). Within the genus Alternanthera, the oldest name for the taxon concerned appears to be A. paronychioides A. St. Hil. (1833). Acceptance of Proposal 449 does not preclude the use of the name Alternanthera ficoides P. Beauv., Fl. Owar. 2 (Apr 1818), by those who maintain that it is a name of another species, not nomenclaturally linked with Gomphrena ficoidea L. and usually placed in the synonymy of Alternanthera sessilis (L.) DC. (1813). Consequences of acceptance of the present Proposal (697) = rejection of Proposal 449 (Veldkamp, 1978).--The name Gomphrena ficoidea L., as lectotypified by Veldkamp, and all later combinations based thereon are not rejected and its epithet can be regarded as the correct one for the taxon also known as Alternanthera paronychioides A. St. Hil. However, if Alternanthera ficoides P. Beauv. is regarded as a name not based on Gomphrena ficoidea L., it predates Alternanthera ficoidea (L.) Smith in Rees, Cycl. 39(I), Add. & Corr. (Dec 1818). As a further consequence one should then treat Smith's combination as a later homonym of Beauvois's name (Arts. 64.1,2; 75.1) and hence as illegitimate.
10.2307/1221493| A description is given of the bibliographical format of the regular instalments of Vols. 1-71, 1818-1888 of the German journal "Flora." The publication schedule of those regular instalments under the successive editors of this period is described. Study of all evidence about the frequency of publication of the regular instalments leads to the conclusion that they really were published at the intervals indicated by the dates in their head-titles. During the editorship of D. H. Hoppe and A. E. Frnrohr (1818-1861) there was a very regular schedule of four fascicles per month. When G. A. W. Herrich-Schffer was editor (1861-1871) the intervals did not follow any regular schedule. During J. Singer's term as editor (1871-1888) a regular schedule of three fascicles at fixed intervals per month was largely maintained. After a discussion of all presently available evidence, it is concluded that the head-title dates of the regular instalments, for the present time, can be accepted as the dates of effective publication for nomenclatural purposes. There are several indications that the head-title dates may be unreliable, especially during the periods with regular publication schedules, but it is not yet possible to replace a questionable head-title date by an established correct one. The problem of the publication dates of the appendices of "Flora" is discussed separately. An inventory of the appendices is given, preceded by a survey of publications related to "Flora" although not true appendices. Information about the dates of the appendices belonging to Vols. 1-15, 1819-1832 is very limited. From Vol. 16, 1833 onwards the publication of the appendices is usually announced in the regular instalments, and the former can be dated with the help of the head-title dates of the latter. In the Annex a detailed bibliographical analysis of Vols. 26-71, 1843-1888 is given. 
10.2307/1221494|The fourteen North American species of Chloris Sw. were subjected to phenetic and cladistic analyses to reassess their affinities. Useful groupings are described and compared to the several groups that the monographer suggested following a classical study. The differences are minor and point up areas for further research.
10.2307/1221495|When ordination methods are used to reduce dimensionality, distortion usually occurs in the representation of resemblance distances. The seriousness of this distortion might not be revealed by examination of a matrix correlation co-efficient. A method is described and illustrated for reducing distortion and improving the representation by an ordination of resemblance distances.
10.2307/1221496| Color charts for use in taxonomic descriptions of plants and animals have been published from time to time since 1686. A listing of these includes about 30 titles, some of which have been published in more than one edition. The most important color charts and treatises dealing with color terminology for naturalists are commented upon in chronological order of publication. Standard abbreviations are used to refer to the more or less currently available color atlases: R.C. (1905--Rpertoire de Couleurs), M.S. (1929--Munsell Book of Color), C.U.C. (1936--Sguy's Code universal des Couleurs), H.C.C. (1939/42--[British] Horticultural Colour Chart), P.F.A. (1957--[German] Horticultural Color Chart), R.H.S.C.C. (1966--R.H.S. Colour Chart), and M.C.C. (1970--Rayner's Mycological Colour Chart). 
10.2307/1221498| A review of the nomenclature of the Diapensiaceae is presented with a brief discussion of some of the interesting aspects of this ancient family. The status of the pink-flowered form of Diapensia lapponica from Alaska has been changed (D. lapponica subsp. obovata f. rosea (Hult.) stat. nov.). /// [French] La nomenclature des Diapensiaces est passe en revue et certains aspects intressants de cette ancienne famille sont discuts. La forme  fleurs roses de Diapensia lapponica, en provenance d'Alaska, change de rang taxonomique (D. lapponica subsp. obovata f. rosea (Hult.) stat. nov.). 
10.2307/1221500|Benkara Adans., a validly published generic name based on "Benkara" Rheede, taxonomically cast aside for more than 200 years because of its incorrect application to Melastomataceae, is here reinstated having priority and being congeneric with Griffithia Wight and Arn., a segregate genus of Randia Houst. ex L. The genus is lectotypified and illustrated. A new combination is made and complete synonymy of the species is given.
10.2307/1221506|During an investigation to determine the distribution, abundance, and populational characteristics of the little known Trifolium stoloniferum Muhl. ex A. Eat., it became evident that type material was not clearly identifiable, and therefore a neotype is here designated.
10.2307/1221508|Study of seed and testa characters of Nicotiana occidentalis Wheeler and N. hesperis Burbidge indicates that the latter is not a subspecies of the former, but a distinct species.
10.2307/1221509|Plagioceltis, a monotypic genus known from the type collected almost 200 years ago, is synonymous with Ampelocera.
10.2307/1221512| The name Lecanora lobulata Flrke is lectotypified, and it is established that the combinations Xanthoria lobulata (by B. de Lesdain) and Caloplaca lobulata (by Hellbom) both are based on Flrke's name of 1815. Xanthoria boulyi Zahlbr., a name sometimes used for the species, is superfluous and illegitimate. 
10.2307/1221517|Apparently unaware of Pergularia R. Br. (1811a), a later homonym of Pergularia L. (1767a, and b), Sundell (1980) retained the names for the tribes typified by the genera Ceropegia L., Marsdenia R. Br. and Stapelia L. respectively as Ceropegieae Benth. (1876), Marsdenieae N. E. Br. (1907) and Stapelieae Benth. (1868). However all the available suprageneric names based on Pergularia are truly based on Pergularia R. Br. non L. and are illegitimate. Accordingly Ceropegieae Dcne. (1842), Marsdenieae Benth. (1868) and Stapelieae Dcne. (1844) are the correct names for the tribes.
10.2307/1221518|World wide distribution of Chloris Sw. (Poaceae) consists of 56 species that are classified into two subgenera, viz., Phacelaria (43 species) and Chloris (13 species).
10.2307/1221521|Some old generic names for Aphyllophorales are discussed, most of which have been published before 1821. Corticium Pers. 1794 is an older name for Laeticorticium Donk 1956; Odontia Pers. 1794 is proposed a nom. rej. in order to conserve Tomentella Pers. ex Pat. 1887; Grandinia Fr. 1838 is an older name for Hyphodontia J. Erikss. 1958 (further synonyms are: Odontia Pers. sensu auct., Lyomyces P. Karst. 1881, Kneiffiella P. Karst. 1889, Chaetoporellus Bond. & Sing. ex Singer 1944); Trombetta Adans. 1763 and Sterbeeckia Dumort. 1822 are older names for Craterellus Pers. 1825 (nom. cons.); and Terana Adans. 1763 is the oldest name for the monotypic genus Pulcherricium Parm. 1968.
10.2307/1221721|Systematists in general, and those applying numerical methods in particular, frequently use ratios to express the shape of plant organs in order to standardize for size. However, ratios may have undesirable statistical properties and do not accurately represent the change in shape that occurs during development. Because of changes in allometric growth during development, ratios are often highly correlated with size and thus may not be effective methods of standardization. The slope of the regression line is a better measure of certain aspects of shape, and the intercept of the line can in some cases provide additional valuable information for comparative purposes. Difficulties associated with using regression analysis include the requirement for a reasonable sample size, increased computational expenses, and the disposition of cases where a low regression coefficient is obtained. Shape characters defined by regression analysis for cladistic inference may also be more suitable than ratios.
10.2307/1221722|The life history of a taxonomist, with asides, from his student years at UCLA to his search for euphorbs in Ceylon, is presented.
10.2307/1221723|In preparing an account of the 22 species of Atriplex L. (Chenopodiaceae) that are native or introduced to Canada (Bassett et al., in press), it proved necessary to investigate in detail the application and typification of several names (including Atriplex itself). An account of the status of A. suckleyi (Torrey) Rydb. has already been published (McNeill et al., 1979), and a proposal to reject the name A. hastata L. is in preparation. This paper describes the results of the other nomenclatural investigations and where necessary reports taxonomic conclusions that bear on the nomenclature being adopted.
10.2307/1221724| The validity and application of specific and varietal names in the Polypodium virginianum complex were investigated. Lectotypification of both P. virginianum L. and P. vulgare L. var. americanum Hooker is proposed, the former based on a plate in Morison and the latter on a collection by Percival at Kew. On morphological grounds, the types of both taxa appear to represent the tetraploid race in the complex. Hooker's variety therefore becomes a later synonym of the Linnaean species. Polypodium vinlandicum Lve and Lve was based on the type of Hooker's variety and thus is also synonymous with the tetraploid cytotype of P. virginianum. The name Polypodium "oreophilum" has sometimes been accepted as a legitimate name for some West Virginian plants in the complex. The combination, however, was never validly accomplished and so must be rejected. Furthermore, the use of the epithet for any member of this group is now prohibited by the South American P. oreophilum Maxon. 
10.2307/1221725|The type material of Cordylecladia andersonii Grunow (=Gracilaria andersonii (Grunow) Kylin) is similar to the type material of the common North American species of Gracilaria (Gigartinales), G. sjoestedtii Kylin, which in turn is identical with Gracilaria lemaneiformis (Bory) Weber-van Bosse, previously known from Pacific South America. Gracilaria andersonii of Kylin, on the other hand, which takes its epithet from C. andersonii, is a distinct species and is here named Gracilaria papenfussii, new species.
10.2307/1221726| Recent research by the authors on West Indian pteridophytes has made it possible to identify for the first time or to correct prior misidentifications of many illustrations of ferns and a few fern-allies from Hispaniola and Martinique which were published by Plumier in his "Trait des Fougres de l'Amrique." Many of these plates serve as types for species published by Linnaeus and other early authors, and so their identity is of considerable nomenclatural importance. 
10.2307/1221727| The changes in Art. 13 agreed at Sydney in 1981 mean that the lectotype of the genus Hypoderma DC. selected by Hhnel (1917) is no longer acceptable. The identities of the original species of the genus are accordingly established, and the genus is correctly lectotypified. It unavoidably becomes an older name for Lophodermium Chev. As this last genus is large and contains species of economic importance, a conservation proposal is made to allow continued use of the two generic names as they are currently understood. 
10.2307/1221729|All commonly used infrageneric names of upper rank in a bilevel classification, or at the only rank in a one-level classification for Crataegus are considered here, and the correct form of citation at both sectional and serial rank, basionym, etc., are indicated in each case.
10.2307/1221730|The nomenclatural problems connected with the name Chaetangium are resolved by abandoning this name and proposing the conservation of Suhria against it, the adoption of a new family name to replace Chaetangiaceae Kuetzing, and the re-adoption of the old name Nothogenia Montagne (to replace Chaetangium in its established application), with six recombinations: Nothogenia fastigiata, N. pulvinata, N. cornea, N. pseudosaccata, N. erinacea and N. ovalis. The homonymy of Erinacea Lamouroux (1824) and Erinacea Link (1831) is discussed and the suggestion is made to conserve Erinacea Link.
10.2307/1221731| A working prototype of a portable solar powered field drier is described. The unit is capable of drying up to 100 plants on a sunny day, at temperatures of up to 60C in the center of the press. 
10.2307/1221732|The use of microwave ovens to treat herbarium specimens as part of the curatorial process, while efficient and convenient, may cause irreparable damage and loss of information for future researchers.
10.2307/1221734|A lactophenol gel made with methyl cellulose is described as a combination clearing and mounting medium for bryophytes with delicate cell wall structure collapsing in other media such as Hoyer's Solution.
10.2307/1221738| The correct spelling of the name of an Ilex hybrid is shown to be I.  altaclerensis not I.  altaclarensis. 
10.2307/1221740| Gomara racemosa Ruiz & Pavn, described as Scrophulariaceae, is transferred to the Buddlejaceae. It is synonymous with Sanango durum Bunting and Duke and replaces that name. 
10.2307/1221741| [German] Die Namen folgender 9 Gattungen werden lectotypisiert: Bolusiella, Ceratostylis, Cryptophoranthus, Haraella, Notylia, Otochilus, Pelatantheria, Promenaea, Sobennikoffia. Ferner wird auf 3 Gattungen eingegangen, die bereits lectotypisiert waren, hierber aber nichts im "Index Nominum Genericorum Plantarum" vermerkt ist: Chamaeangis, Coelogyne, Pecteilis. /// The names of the following 9 genera are lectotypified: Bolusiella, Ceratostylis, Cryptophoranthus, Haraella, Notylia, Otochilus, Pelatantheria, Promenaea, Sobennikoffia. Furthermore 3 genera are considered which were already lectotypified, but this is not recorded in the "Index Nominum Genericorum Plantarum": Chamaeangis, Coelogyne, Pecteilis. 
10.2307/1221742|Four further names are included in the synonymy of species of Cortaderia including one from Calamagrostis and another from Danthonia. The reproductive system in C. bifida is confirmed as autonomous apospory; no polliniferous plants of C. pungens have been seen in herbaria and it is suggested that this taxon may also be apomictic. Gynodioecism, the prevalent mode in the genus, is recorded for C. planifolia.
10.2307/1221743| Several infrageneric names in Solanum have been incorrectly applied and attributed. The names date from the 1813 and 1816 works of Michel-Flix Dunal, of Montpellier, France. Solutions to these nomenclatural problems are proposed here. 
10.2307/1221748|Stenocactus (Schumann) Berger (1929), based on Echinocactus subg. Stenocactus Schumann (1898), is the only legitimate generic name for Echinofossulocactus sensu Britton & Rose (1922). The competing generic names Brittonrosea Speg. (1923) and Efossus Orcutt (1926) were both illegitimate when published and remain so. Valid publication of Echinofossulocactus should be credited to Lawrence (1841). This name no longer competes with Stenocactus following its relectotypification by Hunt (1980), who rejected the earlier lectotypification by Britton and Rose as mechanical and hence arbitrary under the terms of Art. 8.1. Conservation of Stenocactus is not required, nor is its retention at generic rank justified on taxonomic grounds.
10.2307/1221761|Superorder, a rank between subclass and order, is proposed to be added to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. The prefix "super-" and the termination, "-anae" are proposed with -anae considered to be the proper ending over the presently competing termination "-iflorae."
10.2307/1222024|A recent analysis of quantitative variation in cone and needle characteristics indicated that Abies balsamea and A. lasiocarpa from western Canada are not well differentiated morphologically. To further investigate the relationship of A. balsamea to A. lasiocarpa, 10 populations of firs collected from western Saskatchewan to central British Columbia were compared on the basis of their needle flavonoids. Easternmost populations of A. balsamea were distinct from the westernmost samples of A. lasiocarpa; the easternmost firs contain additional flavonoid derivatives including diglycosides, flavones, and dihydroflavonols that were not found in the westernmost samples of A. lasiocarpa. Flavonoid patterns of geographically intermediate populations formed a continuum from east to west beginning in the lower foothills of the east slope of the Rocky Mountains in Alberta and extending to the interior of British Columbia. Although no sharp boundary separating the two species could be detected based on flavonoid results, the observed clinal pattern was steepest at the Rocky Mountain crest. In addition, the populations on either side of the crest were more variable than the 5 mixed-wood populations to the east of the mountains. This pattern of variation suggests that genetic inter-change has occurred between A. balsamea and A. lasiocarpa to each side of the Rocky Mountain crest following post-glacial migration.
10.2307/1222025|The choice, construction, and evaluation of characters is central to systematic botany. Yet, how a systematist does this is rarely revealed or even discussed in his published works. Although the method suggested here is quantitative in nature, it does not depend either conceptually or computationally on numerical clustering. Indeed, it is our intent to provide a tool that can be used by a non-numerical taxonomist, prior to reaching any taxonomic decisions, to choose, construct, and evaluate potentially useful characters that will work for taxa recognition, without the need for arbitrary or subjective numerical clustering techniques. Here we will exemplify an idea for evaluating characters, by presenting first the basic idea, then the specimens and characters that constitute our example, next a discussion of the choice, construction and evaluation of these characters in a traditional context without consideration of spatial auto-correlation character analysis, and finally we present the results of spatial auto-correlation character analysis and discuss them in the light of the traditional assessment of characters. Our purpose in offering this method of character analysis is not to enable the worker to stop thinking about characters, but to enable him to think about them even more thoroughly by revealing their pattern of variation in phenetic space.
10.2307/1222026|The effect of directing characters on cladistic analysis is discussed. Characters can conflict because of the character state membership of the EUs, the ordering of character states, or direction. Conflicts of characters were analyzed in twenty-three data sets containing a total of 1024 characters. At least 93 percent of character conflicts in these data sets were not due to incorrectly hypothesized direction. Most character conflicts are caused by similarities among EUs that are due to parallelisms or reversals that were not recognized by the systematist. Arguments against a priori directing of characters are presented. It is recommended that an undirected analysis be performed first and that the undirected tree be directed subsequently.
10.2307/1222029|Morphological, life history and biochemical characters are used to show why the genus Mastocarpus should be reinstated for four widely distributed species of Gigartina (Gigartinaceae). Mastocarpus species have channelled thalli on which the female reproductive structures and carposporophytes are formed on specially formed papillate structures, have heteromorphic-type (and associated direct-type) life histories involving an alternation with tetrasporophytes previously referred to the genus Petrocelis, and tetrasporangia are formed singly. Gigartina species do not have specially formed papillae, have isomorphic gametophytes and sporophytes, and tetrasporangia are produced in branched or unbranched chains. Mastocarpus species share many features in common with the Phyllophoraceae and Gigartinaceae but it is proposed that the Petrocelidaceae Denizot be adopted for this genus on the basis of the character of the formation of tetrasporangia singly rather than in chains.
10.2307/1222030|A list is provided of all the legitimate names available for application to subtribes, tribes, subfamilies, and segregate families of the Lamiaceae. The names Elsholtzieae, Prunelleae and Tetrachondraceae are formally validated. Also presented are earlier generically based names which are invalid or inoperative under Art. 35.2 of the Code. Correct names are provided for the familial subdivisions recognized in three widely accepted systematic treatments of the Lamiaceae. Action by the Sydney Congress that affects nomenclature of the subdivisions of families is discussed.

10.2307/1221161|Aspects of the development of systematics, and particularly the systematics of higher plant groups, in the period 1690-1960 are discussed. Botanists throughout this period have considered higher taxa in natural classifications to be largely polythetic. There are no characters the possession of which are necessary and sufficient for group membership, but of the character common in a group (but neither exclusive to it or constant within it) the possession of several is needed for group membership. The practice of character weighting, developed towards the end of the eighteenth century, permitted some consistency in the use of characters and yet allowed the recognition of these polythetic groups. The largely superficial knowledge of plants led to apparent affinities being recognizable between one group and a variety of other groups, with each character indicating affinity behaving independently. Thus with the demise of the scala naturae in the late 1700's, the overwhelming majority of botanists adopted analogies of relationships to webs, nets, maps, or other basically horizontal, planar, reticulating structures, and use of these analogies was general by 1859. Discussion of relationships emphasized intermediates, and sometimes continuity between groups. Relations were considered to be directly between groups and were not immediately hierarchical. Typology, with types as abstractions of groups, was not developed to any great extent, largely because of the limited information provided by anatomy, development, and paleontology. In zoology, on the other hand, the large amount of data accruing from these disciplines (connected with the different nature of the organisms) permitted the strong development of typological thought. Analogies of natural relationships as vertical, tree-like structures were developed--relationships were hierarchical and non-reticulate, and were via the type of the group, rather than directly between the members of the groups themselves. With the publication of "The Origin of Species" in 1859, systematists did not change the way they constructed classifications, but only the explanations as to what they thought these classifications represented. This set up a fundamental conflict in botany. Classifications were produced by a methodology that was developed when it was expected that relationships would be reticulate (horizontal), yet they explained the classifications in nested hierarchical (vertical) terms. Classifications were to represent phylogeny, in addition to the tasks such as information retrieval and predictivity that they had historically assumed. There was little explicit information as to how groups were to be formed. In practice the factors that influenced group membership were: the nature of the plant body, reliance on external features to provide evidence of relationship, the primacy of a prior belief in relationship, the equation of parallelism with homology, the extent of comparison of characters, and the effect of current group membership on future group membership. These factors were also largely operative in the pre-1859 period. Apart from the development of floral formulae and diagrams, typology did not develop strongly after 1859 for the same reasons that it did not develop earlier--many plant groups were neither morphologically coherent nor unambiguously separable from coordinate groups. Thus the evidence available did not favor the adoption of abstractions, and the plasticity of the plant body allowed authors to justify very different typological schemes. The style of phylogenetic discussion still focused on concerns such as intermediate taxa, taxa as grades or levels of organization arising from other taxa of the same rank, and relationships being directly between taxa. Intermittent attempts to emphasize characters denoting lineages were generally rejected as showing too few characters to be useful. Reactions to phylogenetic botany (and zoology as well) stressed the circularity problems in going from classification to phylogeny and the generally "unscientific" nature of systematics, but did not focus on the fundamental problem of horizontal methodology and vertical explanation. Attempts to make taxonomy more "scientific" emphasized the adoption of objective numerical methods and the avoidance of a priori weighting of characters. These attempts led to the development of the phenetic school. Classifications were to be general purpose using all characters, not special purpose (this included phylogenetic classification) using few characters. However, the uses of a general purpose classification were never really discussed in the context of mid-twentieth century biology. Additional concerns over stability of classification and the failure to see a uniform result of the various and decidedly non-uniform speciation mechanisms then known seem to have influenced these deliberations. Attempts were also made to produce classifications that more clearly reflected phylogenetic relationships. These attempts were affected by the feeling that taxonomy should become more "scientific," but otherwise they did not address the particular concerns that motivated the development of the phenetic school. From Linnaeus onwards, the development of taxonomy can be seen as a complex interaction between groups more or less intuitively formed on the basis of rather restricted evidence and the subsequent theoretical justification of these groups. In the early 1800's, the general adoption of horizontal analogies in the discussion of the relationships of groups influenced the methodology of group formation. However, both the methodology and style of discussion of relationships persisted largely unchanged into the post-1859 era in which a different method of group formation and a different style of discussion were required. The tensions arising in systematics from this unperceived conflict, as well as other perceived problems with phylogenetic systematics, led to two reactions: one in some sense strengthened the connection of twentieth century taxonomy with an early nineteenth century pre-evolutionary world view, the other led to an attempt to reform taxonomy so that it became consistent with evolutionary ideas.
10.2307/1221162|Wagner groundplan-divergence analysis provides a suitable method for reconstructing phylogenies given suitable criteria for determining primitive and derived characters in a series of homologous characters. Approximately half of the papers surveyed determined such polarities using an out-group criterion while the other half employed criteria that were suspect, simply incorrect or none at all. Four data sets were used to compare the Wagner groundplan-divergence method with Hennig argumentation, Wagner 78 (a computerized Wagner algorithm) and CLINCH 3 (a compatibility algorithm). Hennig argumentation and Wagner 78 performed in a similar manner as Wagner groundplan-divergence. CLINCH provided solutions that were either incomplete or incompatible with the results obtained by other methods. We conclude that compatibility analysis is not to be preferred and may be misleading.
10.2307/1221163|Taxonomic congruence is the degree to which classifications of the same organisms contain the same groupings. To aid in understanding such a concept, the types of experimental design for its study, a list of the modes of appraisal of it, a possible explanation for the results and the systematic implications of the problem, are presented. According to theoretical expectations (hypotheses of nonspecificity and Hennig's) if we follow the right methodological steps we should obtain perfect congruence. Nevertheless, the facts indicate that perfect congruence has rarely been obtained. There are two kinds of causes for the lack of perfect congruence: biological and methodological. The biological causes affect the phenetic and evolutionary approaches and are given by the degree of causal interdependence between the two sets of characters used. This interdependence decreases (incongruence increases) by several interacting phenomena (e.g. mosaic evolution). The methodological causes affect all kinds of approaches and are the technical steps that distort the appraisal of congruence. All the characters of the same taxon share their cladistic relationships but not necessarily their patristic and phenetic relationships. Thus, in a purely cladistic approach all kinds of characters have the same value. In an evolutionary or in a phenetic approach, a kind of character will be important if it shares with many others its patristic and phenetic relationships. Congruence is a good criterion for a cladistic approach, but a doubtful one for an evolutionary or phenetic approach, since incongruence could be the result of the biological phenomena that these two classificatory schools try to take into account in the construction of their classifications.
10.2307/1221164|A review is provided of the nature and support of the international structures responsible for botanical and zoological nomenclature. In the case of botany these are the Nomenclature Section of the International Botanical Congress, the Division of Botany of the International Union of Biological Sciences (IUBS), the Permanent Committee for Botanical Nomenclature, the Commission on the Nomenclature of Plants, and the International Association of Plant Taxonomy (IAPT). In the case of zoology there are the Division of Zoology of IUBS, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, and the International Trust for Zoological Nomenclature. A comparison is made to draw out the essential differences between the structures.
10.2307/1221167|A chromosome count for Hippeastrum iguazuanum was made, using the acetocarmine squash technique, and the species was found to have a somatic chromosome number of 2n = 24. New nomenclature was provided for the species to conform with the conserved generic name.
10.2307/1221168|Compactors using open shelving and taking advantage of all available vertical space can allow specimens to be stored at significantly higher densities than in immobile systems.

10.2307/1221175|In a considerable number of cases names of new species have been validated by direct or indirect reference to previously published descriptions of genera in which no species names had been proposed. This procedure, although it to a number of practising taxonomists seems to be contrary to the ruling of the present Code of Botanical Nomenclature, has in fact been sanctioned by the inclusion of a few such validated species names as types of generic names in Appendix III of the Code, and the inclusion of a much larger number of such names as the types of generic names in the ING. Some problems connected with this procedure are outlined, and it is suggested that action is taken to make the Code clearer on this point. A possible change of Art. 42 to effect this is presented for discussion.
10.2307/1221176|A chronological list of dates in the rules of the ICBN is given. A list indicating which dates pertain to the main taxonomic groups is added.
10.2307/1221177|In the new Code, Appendix III (nomina generica conservanda et rejicienda) was considerably revised by the Editorial Committee. The kinds of changes are discussed, with examples, and the reasoning underlying changes made in special cases is presented.
10.2307/1221179| Lindernia pusilla Boldingh (Oct. 1916) is recognized as a validly described 'new' species with its own (unspecified) type. L. caespitosa (Bl.), comb. nov. (Diceros caespitosa Blume 1826) is proposed to replace L. pusilla (Thunb.) Merrill (Nov. 1916), L. pusilla (Willd.) Schlechter (1924) and L. pusilla sensu Philcox (1968), non Boldingh (1916). 
10.2307/1221180| Medicago sativa subsp.  varia (T. Martyn) O. Bols & Vigo is determined to be unnecessary. 
10.2307/1221182| Variable thallus form and anatomy within three species of the genus Colpomenia (Endlicher) Derbs et Solier has generated some confusion as to their true identity. Herbarium specimens representing the original species concepts of Colpomenia sinuosa (F. C. Mertens ex Roth) Derbs et Solier, C. bullosa (Saunders) Yamada and C. peregrina (Sauvageau) Hamel were examined in detail according to soral shape, form of plurilocular reproductive tissue and presence or absence of a cuticle covering reproductive tissue. Colpomenia sinuosa is the only one of the three species with a cuticle. Colpomenia bullosa has a diffuse soral pattern and very distinctive plurilocular cells. Colpomenia peregrina has a diffuse soral pattern but its reproductive tissue differs from C. bullosa. Although some intermediate morphs may exist between these three taxa, we conclude that three separate species should be recognized. 
10.2307/1221188|The nomenclature of three Western and Central Malesian species of Agathis Salisb. (Araucariaceae) is discussed. The type of Pinus dammara Lamb., the basionym of Agathis dammara (Lamb.) L. C. M. Rich. in the current, restricted sense belongs to another species, Agathis borneensis Warb., and may therefore be rejected under Article 69. The correct name for the North Central Malesian species is then Agathis philippinensis Warb., that for the South Central Malesian one Agathis celebica (Koord.) Warb., which combination is also to be used when only a single species is recognised for Central Malesia. However, when a large, polymorphic species is accepted the Article does not apply and a proposal to maintain Agathis dammara and similar combinations for 'Sammelarten' is endorsed. The new combination Agathis celebica (Koord.) Warb. ssp. flavescens (Ridl.) Veldk. & Whitmore is given.
10.2307/1220975|Integration of morphological and micromolecular data sets into a single system of classification is a major challenge facing the plant systematist of our time. Here an attempt is made to this end with regard to the upper levels of angiosperm classification. In particular, natural products which derive from the shikimate pathway are considered. Their distribution and biosynthesis demonstrates the existence of micromolecular links between the magnoliid, caryophyllid and monocotyledonous families, thus paralleling morphological characters. Chemical evidence is also in favour of the earlier idea that the largest gap within angiosperms is not that between dicotyledons and monocotyledons, but one that separates magnoliid, caryophyllid and monocotyledonous families (the "magnolialean block") from the rest of the dicotyledons (the "rosiflorean block"). However, in contrast to some previous authors, here the monocotyledons are found to encompass a homogeneous, morphologically clearly delimited assemblage. Anomalous occurrences of micromolecules, such as ellagitannins in the Nymphaeales, are discussed and the importance of chemically discordant characters for the recognition of convergences is emphasized. A biosynthetic extrapolation indicates that the early angiosperms were characterized by a full-fledged expansion of the shikimate pathway and a broad oxidation-reduction potential. These properties permitted the production of the neolignans, oxidative coupling products of allyl- and propenylphenols, and of 1,3-diarylpropanes, highly reduced flavonoid types. From here, stepwise suppression of the shikimate pathway must have led to the utilization of intermediates of this pathway characterized by higher oxidation levels, and finally to a total blocking of the shikimate pathway for the synthesis of micromolecules. It is hypothesized that the broad oxidation-reduction potential of the angiosperms and the full expansion of the shikimate pathway present at the beginning of their evolutionary history provided a much greater capacity of micromolecular variation than was present in other plant groups and thus contributed significantly to their evolutionary success.
10.2307/1220976| Fifty-five specimens of 20 serpentine-endemic phanerogams from the Great Dyke, Zimbabwe were analysed for nickel and 15 other elements. The data confirmed the hyperaccumulator status (> 1000 g/g in dried material) of Pearsonia metallifera and identified a further three hyperaccumulators which have not previously been recorded: Blepharis acuminata, Merremia xanthophylla, and Rhus wildii. Dicoma niccolifera did not appear to have the hyperaccumulator status previously assigned to it. Chromium levels in no case exceeded 98 g/g (dry weight) in contrast to previously published work on the same species which gave values at least 20 times higher. It is suggested that these earlier samples might have been contaminated from the Noro chrome mine from which they had been collected. Correlation analysis of the data indicated that except for nickel, other metals of the ferride group (chromium, cobalt, iron and manganese) were accumulated in vegetation in the same ratio as their occurrence in the soil and that there was no enrichment or rejection of any of these elements by the plants which accumulated them in a passive manner. Perhaps the most significant result of the study was the highly significant inverse relationship between magnesium in plants and the concentrations of the nutrients aluminium, boron, cobalt, iron, manganese, phosphorus and sodium. This finding points to the great importance of antagonism to nutrient uptake, caused by high magnesium levels in the soil and is probably the major cause of infertility of serpentine soils and of the development of specialised serpentine floras which have adapted to the unfavourable edaphic conditions. 
10.2307/1220977|The style of the Asteraceae varies in the direction of its branching. In examples studied in the subfamily Asteroideae the disk flowers or flowers of homogamous heads have style branches diverging radially to the center of the head. In that subfamily, the style branches in the ray flowers are usually tangentially directed in the Heliantheae, Inuleae and Senecioneae, and are radially directed in the Astereae and Anthemideae. In examples studied in the subfamily Cichorioideae, the Lactuceae and Vernonieae have tangential style branches in all flowers, Carduus of the Cardueae has styles all radial, they vary in the Liabeae, and they have a Helianthean pattern in Haplocarpha of the Arctoteae. It seems significant that tribes with basically different style orientations in the ray and disk flowers of the same head are usually tribes where many members have sterile gynoecia in either the rays or the disk.
10.2307/1220978|A simple method is described for defining multi-state taxonomic characters from measurement data. Bar diagrams are used to observe the pattern of variation of the measurements both within and between the units to be classified. The method gives definitions which are superior to arbitrary subdivisions of the range both in revealing taxonomic correlations and in reducing the effects of sampling error.

10.2307/1220980|Leaf epidermis of grasses is structurally elaborate and quite important in modern systematics of the Poaceae. Available techniques used in preparing leaf epidermis for microscopic studies are time-consuming and do not always produce adequate preparations. A simple and convenient technique is proposed in this paper which requires the application of a film of clear nail polish directly to the leaf surface. The impressions left on the polish film after drying produce an excellent detailed image of the epidermis. This technique is also applicable to other plant families.

10.2307/1220984|An examination of European botanic garden ephemera has revealed over 250 overlooked binomials applied to vascular plants. Besides some 23 changes in authority, there are changes in names: Rhamnus pallasii Fisch. & Mey. becomes R. erythroxyloides Hoffmanns. in which two subspecific combinations are proposed; Potentilla fulgens Wall. ex Hook. is antedated by P. lineata Trev.; Thysanolaena maxima (Roxb.) Kuntze is T. latifolia (Roxb. ex Hornem.) Honda; Tillandsia maxima Lillo & Hauman becomes T. australis Mez; new combinations are proposed in Encyclia and Miscanthus and a new name in Crinum. There will probably have to be changes in Rabdosia, Rotala and Triumfetta and possibly in Arenaria, Calceolaria, Crinum, Croton, Flaveria, Haageocereus, Helianthus and Pinus, while some names in Achillea, Acrostichum, Betonica, Carex, Cnicus, Commelina, Eclipta, Iris, Pandanus, Pelargonium, Phyteuma, Pothos, Rhus, Silene and Verbascum remain to be disposed of and Leucas lavandulifolia Sm. is restored.

10.2307/1220986|According to Art. 6.4 of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (Sydney), "An illegitimate name is one that is designated as such in Arts. 18.3 or 63-67 (see also Art. 21 Note 1 and Art. 24 Note 1)." Art. 6.3 defines legitimacy; "A legitimate name is one that is in accordance with the rules." A name which is not "in accordance with the rules" is not necessarily illegitimate however. If it is contrary to Art. 33 the name is invalid. If the name is contrary to Art. 57 it is merely incorrect. A sentence was added to Art. 6.4 at Sydney, stating "A name which according to this Code was illegitimate when published cannot become legitimate later unless it is conserved." Despite the wording of previous Codes in speaking of "illegitimate names or epithets" there was agreement among most botanists to whom I referred the point that epithets cannot be illegitimate. Legitimacy is a property of a validly published name. If a name is not validly published it has no standing under the Code. If it is validly published then it is either legitimate or illegitimate. If it is legitimate then it is used either correctly or else incorrectly. The Editorial Committee for the Sydney Code accepted this and deleted all references to "illegitimate epithets" from the Sydney Code while that was in draft. This affects only slightly the meaning of Art. 6. It has long seemed to me that if a name is validly published then it can be used correctly or incorrectly; I see no need for a special category of names which are valid but not legitimate. In coming to this viewpoint I have examined the origins and effects of the concept of nomenclatural illegitimacy and these studies have confirmed for me my suspicion that the entire concept of legitimacy/illegitimacy is an unnecessary, confusing encumbrance on the Code and that the purposes of botanical nomenclature will be best served if we get rid of it. This paper sets forth the arguments for this position.
10.2307/1220987| Contrary to what has been asserted in a recent paper, the works of Asso, Aublet, Grimm, and Forsskl remain sources of valid binomials and are not to be rejected as "non-Linnean," although the latter's 'Flora aegyptiaco-arabica' poses indeed some problems yet to be resolved. The second sentence of Art. 23.6(c) is inappropriate and misleading, and should better be deleted.

10.2307/1220775| Phytoserology uses the specific properties of immunosera produced by animals against plant protein characters to assess plant relationships. Unlike animalserum proteins, plant protein extracts have peculiar properties which make phytoserological work difficult. Careful experiments by early workers gave phytoserology a hopeful start but this was spoiled by the inadequate methods of the Knigsberg school and the extravagant claims for their evolutionary tree. Thanks to the critical new start made by Otto Moritz in the 1950s, phytoserology is now established as a valid method in systematics just as it is in immunology and protein chemistry. /// [German] Nach den ersten, hoffnungs volen Anfngen der phytoserologie hat der "Knigsberger Stammbaum" deren Anwendung in der vergleichenden Verwandtschaftsforschung fr lange Zeit zurckgeworfen.

10.2307/1220776|Consensus trees are graphical summarizations of the information shared between two or more classifications of the same set of elements. A new application of consensus tree methods, useful for those performing cluster analyses, is described. When more than one phenogram is produced during the course of a cluster analysis, consensus trees can be used to summarize the information about group structure shared by the different phenograms. This can lead to a clearer understanding of group relationships in the data. Application of consensus tree methods, specifically Adams-II and durchschnitt consensus, in cluster analyses of Crataegus individuals, made a significant contribution to clarifying species relationships in a taxonomically difficult genus.
10.2307/1220777|Dodonaea cuneata, D. angustissima and D. viscosa form the Dodonaea viscosa complex in Australia. An electronic digitiser was used to trace outlines of leaves of the D. viscosa complex, and the digitised images were stored on computer thus allowing rapid data access and retrieval. Characters usually measured by hand were derived from the stored images, along with a number of characters which are difficult to measure manually (such as area, curvature and indices of symmetry and shape). Multivariate analyses showed the full set of computer derived characters to be better in discriminating between and in clustering the 173 individuals than the hand measurable character set. However, the analysis showed that the differences between the three taxa of this complex are not sufficiently significant to warrant recognition at the species level, thus supporting the conclusions drawn from flower and fruit morphology. The advantages of the digitiser as a technique include fast data collection (1 minute to digitise each leaf), accessible and readily retrievable computer data, the potential for deriving and measuring more complex characters, and the ability to plot the leaf images for visual interpretation.

Mail transit of the serial from Berlin to Berkeley, California, averaged 40.7 days (42.0 if abnormal times are included) per issue for 1903 to 1916 and 44.0 days (51.1 days) per issue for 1922 to 1941, with some issues in 1906 requiring only eleven or twelve days for intercontinental and transcontinental transit. Transit times of issues and the total number of pages and numbered references per volume are graphed; these varied directly with unfavorable economic and especially wartime conditions in Germany.
10.2307/1220782| It is shown that a well-defined scheme in agreement with the Linnaean method has been used in writing up diagnoses and descriptions of new genera with new species in the 'Descriptiones' of Forsskl's Flora Aegyptiaco-Arabica. Frequent deviations from this scheme by the editor of Forsskl's posthumous work do not prevent us from distinguishing between generic diagnoses, generic descriptions, specific diagnoses, and specific descriptions. The specific epithet of the first new species in a new genus is often published elsewhere in the Flora. The consequences of these observations for the validity of a number of names are shown. The following names, valid under the modern Code, are dealt with in more detail: Alternanthera, with A. achyranthes; Chadara (=Grewia L., 1753), with C. tenax, C. arborea (wrongly indicated as the type of I.N.G.), and C. velutina; Charachera (=Lantana L., 1753), with C. tetragona, and C. viburnoides (wrongly indicated as the type by I.N.G.); Micrelium (=Eclipta L., 1771), with M. asteroides and M. tolak (wrongly indicated as the type by I.N.G.); Turia (=Luffa Miller, 1754), with T. sativa (lectotype, selected here), T. leloja, T. gijef, and T. moghadd. The generic names Saelanthus, Suaeda and Catha are not validly published, and as a consequence none of the specific epithets published in combination with these generic names. Zilla, with Z. myagrioides, is validly published under the present Code. The generic name Elcaja is considered validly published, but Elcaja roka is not. 
10.2307/1220783| It is recommended that the orthography of Forsskl's family name to be used in bibliography and when referred to in scientific papers is 'Forsskl.' The abbreviation recommended for citation in connection with Latin plant names is 'Forssk.' When used for the formation of Latin scientific names a number of the variant spellings proposed in the past can be accepted, e.g. with -s- or -ss-, and with or without -h-, depending upon the choice of the original author. The choice, however, should be restricted to the consonants alone; deviation from an orthography in which the first vowel is -o- and the second is -- (transcribed according to Art. 73.6 as -ao- in Latin plant names) should be treated as an orthographic error and hence corrected. The history of the special Scandinavian letter -- is briefly outlined. 
10.2307/1220784|Bibliographic details are presented in tabular form. Effective publication of Abteilung 1 was in 1913, of Abteilung 2 in 1915 and of Abteilung 3 was from 1921 to 1929. Page numbers of Heft 89 of Bibliotheca Botanica are the numbers in brackets at the top inner edge of each page.
10.2307/1220785|Known validly published suprageneric names attributable to Araceae, including family names, are accounted for. Comments are made on nomenclatural problems in these ranks with particular reference to parenthetic author citation (sparingly accepted) and the apparently continuing illegitimate status (not accepted) of suprageneric names based on formerly illegitimate names that have been conserved. Table 1 lists the names alphabetically by the type generic name. Appendix 1 evaluates the status of each name in terms of the recent updating of Engler's system of the family; seven names must be changed. Appendix 2 and 3 add Anadendreae Bogner et French, trib. nov. and Bognereae Mayo et Nicolson, trib. nov., the latter based on Bognera Mayo et Nicolson, gen. nov.
10.2307/1220786|The characters of the genus Dugandiodendron are discussed in the light of the new findings, and other characters previously reported by the author, supporting the position of the genus.
10.2307/1220790|In order to clarify the terminology used in typification a new term, the paralectotype, is proposed to cover the group of types which remains when a lectotype (and isolectotype(s)) has been selected from the syntypes.
10.2307/1220791|The generic name Suillus Micheli ex Adans. is lectotypified by Suillus granulatus (L.: Fr.) Kuntze. A neotype collection is designated for S. granulatus and a description of microscopic characters is provided. Suillus S. F. Gray no longer has nomenclatural standing and Suillus luteus (L.: Fr.) S. F. Gray (ut "[Schaeff.]") is replaced by S. granulatus as type.
10.2307/1220792|Hyalostemma Wall. is treated as congeneric synonym of Miliusa Leschault. ex A. DC. and H. roxburghiana Wall., as also M. roxburghiana Hook. f. & Thoms. are established as nom. illeg. for Uvaria dioica Roxb. Considering Guatteria globosa DC. (1831) and U. dioica Roxb. (1832) as conspecific, M. globosa (DC.), comb. nov. based on G. globosa DC. is proposed to replace M. roxburghiana Hook. f. & Thoms., nom. illeg.
10.2307/1220793|In their revision of Petrorhagia, Ball and Heywood (1964) recognized five sections, four noted as new combinations. An examination of the Lexicon Generum Phanerogamarum of Post and Kuntze (1903) reveals that they recognized six sections of Petrorhagia. Three of the combinations noted by Post and Kuntze are legitimate; two predate similar combinations made by Ball and Heywood in 1964. Petrorhagia kennedyae (A. K. Jackson & Turrill) Meikle is determined to be a later isonym.
10.2307/1220794| Lectotypes have been designated for Dianthus caryophyllus L. and its named Linnaean varieties, and for D. chinensis L. The connection between D. caryophyllus var. () inodorus L. and D. sylvestris Wulfen is analyzed. Some consequences and aspects of further study are discussed. 
10.2307/1221556|Generic delimitation in the Compositae is notoriously difficult, because a great many of the recognizable groups are connected by palpable intermediates. Neither lumping nor splitting leads consistently to well-defined, conceptually useful genera, and the fruits of a determined pursuit of absolute monophylesis are equally poisonous. In order to have conceptually useful genera, we must accept the fact that many of them are inherently ill-defined and unresponsive to efforts at precision. The number of recognized genera of Compositae has increased from 90 in 1753 to about 1200 today. By 1838 the number had reached 889, and was still rapidly rising. In 1873 Bentham shook the number down to 766. He submerged most of the genera that had been proposed half a century earlier by Cassini, but even so he continued to accept nearly a hundred of them, and some others have subsequently been resuscitated. Much of the increase since Bentham's time reflects new discoveries, but there has also been some splitting and refinement of Bentham's genera. Recent proposals to divide such large genera as Eupatorium and Senecio into hordes of minigenera have provoked a vigorous counter-reaction, and the issue remains in doubt.
10.2307/1221557|Traditional genera of the tribe, based heavily on characters of the pappus and anther appendage, prove totally indefensible, having been subjected to piecemeal alterations by all significant workers since Linnaeus, and being useless for comparison with any new evidence. The total tribal revision of the present authors, based on structure, cytology, geography and chemistry, has 180 genera in 18 subtribes. What was Eupatorium has been distributed among 11 of the subtribes, and is intermixed with elements of other traditional genera. Eupatorium (44 sp., x = 10) remains a distinct arcto-tertiary genus. Mikania (410 sp., x = 18-20), Stevia (229 sp., x = 11, 12), Liatris (42 sp., x = 10), and Brickellia (96 sp., x = 9) have minor changes. Ageratum (40 sp., x = 10) is broadened to include epappose species. Ageratina (230 sp., x = 17), the epiphytic Neomirandea (25 sp., x = 17, 20), Chromolaena (165 sp.), Fleischmannia (79 sp.), Koanophyllon (115 sp.) (all x = 10) are named or restructured to include much that was in Eupatorium. The subtribe Gyptidinae, mostly of eastern Brazil, is one of the two most complex, but has many particularly distinct genera such as Campuloclinium (14 sp.), Trichogonia (30 sp.), Lasiolaena (5 sp.) and Agrianthus (6 sp.) (all x = 10). Most problems of numerous small genera and hybridization involve the largest subtribe Critoniinae of the moist Neotropics, but tests of many individual genera have reinforced their distinct status, i.e., Critonia (38 sp.), Ophryosporus (37 sp.), Fleischmanniopsis (5 sp.) and Neocabreria (5 sp.) (all x = 10). The reclassification reflects the fact that the tribe is neither simple nor comparatively derived in the family.
10.2307/1221558|Since the time of Bentham the traditional view of the Senecioneae has been that of one huge genus (Senecio) plus numerous segregate genera of varying degrees of distinctiveness, plus a few entities of uncertain affinities. Data have accumulated to support the exclusion of some genera from the tribe (e.g. Arnica, Liabum, Munnozia, Schistocarpha, etc.) and to tease botanists about the circumscriptions and affinities of others. Senecio sensu lato incorporates several semi-distinctive natural assemblages that usually have been treated as sections or subgenera. The naturalness of these assemblages is generally acknowledged, as is the fact that the boundaries separating them are imprecise by whatever suites of characters are used to measure them. In several recent studies many segregate genera have been recognized, often with the circumscriptions derived from selected representative species. It is yet unclear that the recognition of numerous segregate genera provides a better taxonomy than treating the variation patterns as infrageneric taxa. A respectable case can be made for maintaining Senecio as a broad concept, at least until revisionary studies at the species level are carried out and the results subjected to critical analyses.
10.2307/1221559|The Hawaiian Madiinae constitute a genetically cohesive and presumably monophyletic alliance of 28 species of extreme habital diversity which traditionally have been dispersed among four genera that are defined primarily by floral and foliar features. Dozens of natural and artificial hybrids between generic and habital categories have been produced. Cytogenetic data indicate that definition of genera according to habit would result in a number of fragmentary groups, each heterogeneous with respect to chromosome number and/or structure. Moreover, in a number of instances species of known cytogenetic identity would be placed in two or more different genera. Disposition of the 28 species in three traditionally recognized genera is recommended. These are Dubautia sensu lato, Argyroxiphium, and Wilkesia.
10.2307/1221560|A study of microcharacters (as viewed with the compound light microscope) in the Eupatorieae was undertaken in order to evaluate their reliability as taxonomic markers. Character states of various microcharacters are widely distributed within the Eupatorieae. Correlations between microcharacters and yet other characters were used in order to evaluate their applicability in delimiting genera. A high degree of such correlation was found in some species groups, suggesting that microcharacters are useful and consistent markers among such taxa, whereas in other groups they may be of little value.
10.2307/1221561|An investigation of the style base, filament collar, endothecium, and carpopodium was conducted in order to evaluate their utility as generic markers in the tribe Astereae. The distribution of character states for these microcharacters does not correspond to generic (or, in some cases, infrageneric) limits as they are recognized by recent authors. Use of the microcharacters considered here for delimiting genera would necessitate widespread realignments of the genera in the tribe and would obscure relationships amongst species groups.
10.2307/1221562|The advantages of greater resolution and depth of field provided by the scanning electron versus the light microscope have led to both a re-evaluation of the usual microcharacters and discovery of novel ones not easily observed by other means. Comparative studies of SEM-level characters in taxa of Compositae have shown that they are taxonomically useful, but that they are neither more nor less valuable as a means of generic delimitation than are macro- or micromorphological ones. As is true of taxonomic data from any source, it is the consistent occurrence of one or more SEM-observed features as a part of a suite of correlated characters that provides sufficient information on which to base systematic decisions. Within this context, it is the newly discovered characters that prove most useful: the chance of finding correlated character suites rises with the number of characters observed. However, because the extent of infraspecific variation in these features has not been thoroughly explored, they should be employed with caution and in conjunction with numerous others in making taxonomic decisions at the generic (or any other) rank.
10.2307/1221563|Several examples may serve to address four basic questions concerning the applicability of chromosomal features to the determination of generic limits in the Astereae: 1) What do chromosome numbers per se tell us? 2) Can we assume that x = 9 (or any other base number) is homologous for all taxa sharing the character state? 3) Can genera with more than one basic chromosome number be regarded as monophyletic? and 4) are chromosomal features correlated with gross morphological characters that will render them useful in the construction of general classifications? The evolutionary conservatism that makes chromosomal features very strong characters also limits the usefulness of the most common feature studied: the basic chromosome number. Chromosome count statistics are presented as a partial answer to the first question and, to prove a point, a "new" chromosome count is reported for Aster carolinianus. Examples are cited (e.g., Astranthium, Brachyscome, Chrysopsis, and Aster sensu lato) to show that base numbers may be primitive, or they may be derived by way of either dysploid reduction or amphidiploid increase. It is mainly with regard to the third question that concepts diverge, and there is no simple answer. The true situation may be that most genera are monobasic, but that there are a few which are not. In this connection, a well-known example in the Aster alliance is discussed, which leads to an answer regarding the last question. Chromosomal features are basic to an understanding of relationships in the Astereae, but more so at the infrageneric than the generic level. Unless correlated with gross morphological (and/or distributional) characteristics, they are of limited value in the determination of generic boundaries.
10.2307/1221564| Crossing data have long been used to help determine the position of species whose generic status is questionable, to help define subgeneric taxa, to merge genera, and, in a limited number of studies, to help establish generic boundaries. Previous studies in the subtribes Peritylinae and Flaveriinae (Helenieae) have demonstrated that crossing data can be employed as a major approach in delimiting generic entities and in establishing relationships between genera. In fact, in the above taxa crossing data proved to be more useful at the genus level than at the species level. Such crossing tests can be employed at optimum only if it is possible to produce hybrids between most of the species in the putative genera concerned. It does appear that it is often possible to obtain comprehensive data from artificial interspecific hybridizations, especially when allopatric perennial taxa are involved. The interpretation of crossing data may present problems because variable interfertility values in different taxa are to be expected, and independent taxonomic judgements must be made in context with information from other approaches. In the tribe Eupatorieae, where extensive generic reorganization has been proposed in recent years, hybridization tests may be possible in some groups (Carterothamnus  Hofmeisteria; Koanophyllon  Pseudokyrsteniopsis) but not in others (Brickellia). 
10.2307/1221565|More than 225 species in the Eupatorieae have been chemically examined to date; the majority of this work has focused on terpenoid constituents. The results thus far depict the tribe as chemically heterogeneous, producing a large number of diverse sesquiterpenes and diterpenes, as well as thymol and benzofuran derivatives. When this diversity is examined in relation to the traditional large genera recognized in the tribe (e.g., Mikania, Stevia) no clear chemical boundaries are found. In comparison, the large genera recognized by King and Robinson are also heterogeneous in their terpenoid chemistry. Mixed results are obtained in correlating terpenoid chemistry with the limits of newly defined small genera. While some of these appear chemically delimited, others are chemically diverse and still others chemically indistinguishable from affiliated genera.
10.2307/1221566|Cladistic classifications seek to recognize monophyletic groups while changing the existing nomenclature as little as possible. When applied to the discussion of generic concepts this approach means that new descriptions and combinations are justifiable only when they are necessary for the delimitation of natural groups of species (monophyletic groups, sensu Hennig).
10.2307/1221567|In 1960, Jackson divided Iva into three sections: Iva, Linearbractea, and Cyclachaena. A reanalysis of Iva using the precepts of Hennigian cladistics reveals 1) that there are no synapomorphies connecting sections Iva and Linearbractea to section Cyclachaena; 2) that there are no synapomorphies connecting the species within Cyclachaena; and 3) that the species of Iva and Linearbractea are unified by three synapomorphies. The analysis also suggests that the five species of Cyclachaena are more closely related to other genera in the subtribe than they are to Iva and Linearbractea. The resulting classification recognizes Iva and Linearbractea as Iva sensu stricto and the five species of Cyclachaena as separate monotypic genera.
10.2307/1221568|The so-called generic problems within the Asteraceae of today are surprisingly like those of 50 years ago, and earlier. It is conjectured that, so long as plant systematics remains an individual enterprise, classifications and their concomitant nomenclatures will vary, depending upon the worker, his background, interests, training and idiosyncrasies. What then can we anticipate as generic guidelines for the near future? Unfortunately there are none: systematics is an intellectual activity and intellects are a mixed bag. However, data accumulation and its numerical application, cladistic or otherwise, must ultimately prevail, so that reasonable generic stability in the far future can be anticipated. This will result as epigenetic choices (sensu Lumsden and Wilson, 1981) become established among both practitioners and users. Such a concensus has largely occurred in ornithology and is likely to prevail in synantherology given time, interest and human survival.
10.2307/1221569| Thirty-two Psychotria species from New Caledonia and 178 from other islands of the Pacific Basin were analyzed for nickel in order to identify hyperaccumulators (> 1000 g/g dry mass) of nickel. P. douarrei was the only taxon which possessed this character and contained a mean concentration of 2.24% nickel in its leaves. This is higher than for any other known hyperaccumulator of nickel. Pot trials showed that P. douarrei can grow in substrates containing up to 1% plant-available nickel. It is suggested that P. dourarrei is a neoendemic taxon possibly derived from P. baillonii which occupies complementary ecological niches on non-nickeliferous soils adjacent to the ultramafic substrates supporting P. douarrei. Evolution may have proceeded via an intermediate nickel-tolerant ecotype of P. baillonii which can still be found growing in association with P. douarrei. 
10.2307/1221570|Flavonoid data, morphological study and propagation trials show that Acer buergerianum 'Jako Kaede' is not aceraceous but the verbenaceous Premna microphylla Turcz.
10.2307/1221571|Principal coordinate (PCA) and minimum spanning tree (MST) techniques were used to analyze trends of variation in the Poaceae. The distribution of the 214 grass genera on the first three factors is presented in two- and three-dimensional diagrams. The Pooideae, Eragrostoideae and Panicoideae appeared at the extreme ends of the three factors. The two major tribes of the Panicoideae, Paniceae and Andropogoneae, were distinct particularly on the third factor. Bambusoideae, Arundinoideae, Centostecoideae, Oryzoideae, and the genera Nardus, Lygeum and Diarrhena occupied intermediate positions and were less divergent from the center of variation. Minimum spanning tree analysis showed that, except for the Arundinoideae, Centostecoideae and the nardoid group, connections among members of each subfamily are considerably higher than those between different subfamilies. This indicates a lack of distortion in the PCA and confirms the naturalness of these taxa. There was only one connection between the Paniceae and Andropogoneae, underscoring the distinctness of the two tribes. The genera Nardus, Diarrhena and Lygeum appeared in adjacent positions but were linked to different subfamilies. The implications of these analyses on the evolution of the Poaceae and the role of polyploidy and hybridization is discussed.
10.2307/1221572|According to the literature there were two botanists, who used maps, possibly for the first time, to illustrate the distribution of plants: Georg Wahlenberg in 1812 and Alphonse de Candolle in 1855. The map of Wahlenberg, however, ought to be considered the first vegetation map and Joachim Schouw had produced the first real plant distribution map in his "Plantegeographisk Atlas," published in 1824.
10.2307/1221573|The attributes of an ethanol bath method of preparing cacti and other stem succulents for mounting on standard herbarium sheets are compared to a microwave method.
10.2307/1221578| It is concluded that Phegopteris Fe (Thelypteridaceae) is an apparently nomenclaturally superfluous name, because, when published, it included what is now established to be the type of Gymnocarpium Newman. Despite this, Phegopteris is a legitimate name as it has a legitimate basionym; it must, however, be cited as Phegopteris (Presl) Fe. The protologue of the basionym of Gymnocarpium dryopteris does not point to any specimen that could serve as type of that name, and hence of Gymnocarpium Newman (Athyriaceae). Moreover, there is no eligible specimen in the Linnaean collections in London, Stockholm or Paris. There is, however, a Burser specimen at Uppsala with a Bauhin name that is not cited in any Linnaean work. This specimen was determined by Linnaeus in his catalogue of the Burser herbarium as Polypodium dryopteris, the basionym of G. dryopteris, and this is designated as the lectotype. This lectotypification preserves existing usage of both the generic and specific names. 
10.2307/1221579| Article 23 is shown to be equivocal with respect to the validity of specific names published in the 'Flora Aegyptiaco-Arabica' of Forsskl (1775) and similar works. 
10.2307/1221580|Encelia grandiflora M. E. Jones, nom. illeg., was published without clear reference to a type, an omission that was apparently overlooked by subsequent workers seeking to deal with the generic position of the species and the illegitimacy of its name. Seeming inconsistency in the treatment of the epithet stems from the differing rules concerning homonymy in the American and International codes of nomenclature at that time. A lectotype is provided.
10.2307/1221581|Several recent studies have concluded that Lophiola aurea Ker-Gawler lacks affinity with the Haemodoraceae, the family under which it has commonly been classified (Edwards et al., 1970; Simpson and Dickison, 1981; Simpson, 1983; Zavada, 1983; Zavada et al., 1983). While comparative studies of tribal and familial groups can facilitate the determination of similarity between different lower taxa, resolution of higher level affinity is often not reached when a taxon appears clearly discordant, as in the case of the monotypic genus Lophiola.
10.2307/1221582|In an earlier article (Kiger, 1973) I reviewed the sectional nomenclature of Papaver, as governed by the then-current Seattle Code. Subsequent revision of Article 35 at the Leningrad Congress has altered the status of several names relating to sections commonly recognized in the genus, four of which now have different correct names. Here I present a revised synopsis of all names proposed in Papaver at the sectional level, arranged according to Fedde's (1936) taxonomy, and I lectotypify Lasiotrachyphylla Bernh.
10.2307/1221583|An early advocate of priority in specific epithets in the face of British colonial botany, William Theobald, validly published some 26 binomials for Burmese plants for the first time in his edition of Mason's "Burmah" (1883). Ignored until now, many are in current use as coined later by Kuntze, Druce and others. One completely overlooked binomial is Vaccinium angulatum (Griff.) Theob., an earlier homonym of V. angulatum J. J. Sm., which is here renamed V. commutatum Mabb. & Sleumer, while Neptunia natans (L. f.) Druce is a later homonym of N. natans (Willd.) Theob., so that N. oleracea Lour. is restored.
10.2307/1221777|Papaver setigerum DC. populations from Mediterranean France and Campania, southern Italy, have been studied morphologically and phytochemically. Papaver setigerum, whose circumscription is reported to be substantially the same as P. somniferum L., revealed to be a species morphologically distinct from the latter. Morphine, codeine, and thebaine, the major alkaloids of P. somniferum, are lacking in capsules of P. setigerum. Their absence supports also at the chemotaxonomical level that P. setigerum is a distinct species from P. somniferum.
10.2307/1221778|This study examines whether a satisfactory classification can be obtained from phenetic clustering of herbarium specimens based on vegetative characters alone. Twelve leaf and twig characters of 731 specimens in 13 taxa within the genus Populus L. were subjected to standard numerical phenetic techniques. A classification based on character means for each taxon corresponded well to the established classification. Another classification based on 68 individual specimens, while showing considerable phenetic affinities of putatively related individuals, yielded an overall unsatisfactory classification. Some sections of the genus were easier to delimit by vegetative characters than others.
10.2307/1221779|The pollen of Bursera tecomaca (DC.) Standl. and of B. sarcopoda P. G. Wilson notably differs from that of remaining species of Bursera, but shows a striking similarity to the pollen of the akin genus Commiphora, mainly distributed in Africa. Additional morphological characters of these two species suggest also their better placement in Commiphora and therefore the formal transfer is proposed.
10.2307/1221780|A search of 24 herbaria for material relevant to the typification of 9 oak (Quercus) names published by S. B. Buckley (1809-1884) produced little authentic material. We therefore designate lectotypes for three names, Q. annulata, Q. mohriana and Q. vaseyana, and neotypes for four names, Q. durandii, Q. san-sabeana, Q. shumardii and Q. texana. Two names, Q. durandii var. san sabia (sic) and Q. rubra var. texana, proposed by Buckley were new combinations and are typified by their basionyms. Quercus texana Buckley, as originally described, appears to be conspecific with Q. nuttallii Palmer of eastern Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas and has priority over the latter name. The name Q. texana has been consistently misapplied, by its author and others, to a species of oak that occurs in central Texas and southeastern Oklahoma. This oak has no valid name and is therefore described as new, Quercus buckleyi Nixon and Dorr. Historical information concerning Buckley's collecting activities, especially as they pertain to his new species of oak, is also provided.
10.2307/1221782|The genus Dilsea Stackhouse (1809, p. 55) currently contains two species, D. carnosa (Schmidel) Kuntze (1898, p. 404) and D. californica (J. Agardh) Kuntze (1891, p. 892); the genus Neodilsea Tokida (1943, p. 96) encompasses six species, N. americana Abbott (1968, p. 187), N. crispata Masuda (1973a, p. 37), N. integra (Kjellman) Zinova (1961, p. 84), N. natashae Lindstrom (1984, p. 29), N. tenuipes Yamada et Mikami in Mikami (1954, p. 83), and N. yendoana Tokida (1943, p. 96). Masuda (1973b, p. 468) described N. integra var. longissima, and Abbott (1982, p. 301) made the combination N. araneosa for Abbotia araneosa Perestenko (1975, p. 1686). I discuss the use of the name Dilsea carnosa rather than D. edulis (Stackhouse) Stackhouse (1809, p. 55) and argue for the reinstatement of Neodilsea integra in Dilsea as D. integra (Kjellman) Rosenvinge (1898, p. 19). Neodilsea longissima (Masuda) comb. nov. is proposed for N. integra var. longissima, and N. borealis (Abbott) comb. nov. is proposed for Schizymenia borealis, an earlier name for N. americana. Neodilsea araneosa is removed from the Dumontiaceae to the Cryptonemiaceae; its correct name is Neoabbottiella araneosa (Perestenko) comb. nov. Lectotypes are designated for D. integra (as Kallymenia? integra), N. borealis (as Schizymenia borealis), and N. yendoana.
10.2307/1221783|The techniques proposed in Taxon 32, 4: 616-617 for preparing Riccias for herbarium study seem inadequate. The author says what we must do and what we must not do to keep Riccias in good conditions on account of their biology, of the specific value of some morphological characters and the possible studies at the present time and in the future.
10.2307/1221788|The specimen currently recognized as the lectotype of Gigartina tenera J. Agardh does not agree with the original protologue and is superseded. A new lectotype is designated which belongs to the taxon currently named Agardhiella subulata (C. Agardh) Kraft et Wynne. Neoagardhiella baileyi (Harvey ex Kuetzing) Wynne et Taylor and Agardhiella tenera (J. Agardh) Schmitz, the generic type, are synonyms of A. subulata. A correct name is needed for the plant currently named Solieria tenera (J. Agardh) Wynne et Taylor, and Euhymenia filiformis Kuetzing appears to be the earliest available, resulting in Solieria filiformis (Kuetzing) Gabrielson comb. nov.
10.2307/1221789|The correct name for the species in a monotypic Leptarrhena (Saxifragaceae) is L. pyrolifolia (D. Don) R. Br. ex Seringe. Reasons are outlined for believing that Rafinesque was the first to lectotypify the genus (with L. pyrolifolia) and for believing that Small's choice of L. amplexifolia should be superseded. Both species names are lectotypified here, however. In a conspectus of the genus, nine synonyms are identified and one species name excluded.
10.2307/1221793|The existing lectotypification of C. sativus L. has been examined. The choice of lectotype, based on the phrase name of C. sativus, is questioned. It is proposed that this lectotype is rejected and superseded by the designation of a new lectotype, based on a specimen of C. sativus L. from the Burser Herbarium (UPS).
10.2307/1221794|Petrorhagia obcordata (Margot & Reuter) S. M. Thomas is shown to be unnecessary.
10.2307/1221799|Syzygium nervosum DC. is established as the correct name for S. operculatum (Roxb.) Niedenzu and Cleistocalyx operculata (Roxb.) Merr. and Perry.
10.2307/1221206|Phylogenetic trees for 11 angiosperm families have been constructed using data from 106 macromolecular sequences, 12 of them new and the rest from published sequences of cytochrome c, plastocyanin, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit, ferredoxin and 5S-ribosomal-RNA. Analyses of data from single macromolecules are not consistent with one another but, for nine families, a phylogenetic tree derived from three macromolecules remains consistent as a fourth macromolecule is added. This nine-family tree is thought to be reliable. The positions of the other two families, Malvaceae and Ranunculaceae, remain uncertain. A relationship between Chenopodiaceae and Polygonaceae confirms other taxonomic work but an equally reliable and close relationship between Fabaceae and Brassicaceae merits further taxonomic investigation.
10.2307/1221207|The nineteenth century history of the discovery of pollen structure and function in flowering plants is reviewed, with special reference to aquatic forms.
10.2307/1221208|There is no general consensus among bryologists as to the best system for describing sexual expression in mosses, liverworts, and hornworts. Existing schemes are not logically consistent: in some cases they emphasize functional considerations and in other cases, genetic considerations. Different authors, especially those working with mosses versus liverworts, use the same term to describe different sexual conditions. Lack of a set of terms collateral with those most widely used for other embryophytes has prevented cross-comparisons to the detriment of understanding in both areas. This paper illustrates these problems and suggests an alternative system of terminology that is logical, consistent, and comprehensive and which coincides with usage for pteridophytes and seed plants.
10.2307/1221209|The Monotoideae are re-examined in detail in comparison with the Dipterocarpaceae. It is concluded that the Monotoideae, including Pakaraimaea, are more closely allied to the Tiliaceae.
10.2307/1221210|Various repeated observations carried out in different areas of the Mediterranean basin have shown that Quercus coccifera L. s.l. has three other reproductive cycles in addition to the normal biennial acorn maturation. It is therefore suggested that the strict description of "biennial" be corrected in all future analytical keys and descriptions.
10.2307/1221211|Transferring Symphysia to Vaccinium expands the circumscription of the latter in terms of pedicel morphology, calyx tube enlargement before anthesis, floral plasticity and seed shape. Although Vaccinium is a diverse genus comprising about 30 sections, adding Symphysia is tantamount to making the genus a dumping ground for any Vaccinieae of uncertain affinity.
10.2307/1221212| Known publications of Huber & Co. (Hyres, France) are listed and their new plants identified as far as possible. The relationship between the nursery and other firms and botanists, particularly Ortgies and Roezl, is explored and names published by other firms also introducing new material, notably that of Roezl from the Americas, are discussed. Many plants are unidentifiable though Cucurbita argyrosperma Huber is the oldest name for C. mixta Pang., while Salvia camphorata Huber may well be an older name for S. apiana Jepson and there may have to be further changes in Cleome and Salvia. Astragalus marianus Huber is an earlier homonym of A. marianus (Rydb.) Barneby, which is here renamed A. piutensis Barneby & Mabb., and Hibiscus spinulosus Huber is an earlier homonym of H. spinulosus (W. V. Fitzg.) F. B. Wilson, which is here renamed H. fryxellii Mabb. There are changes in authority in currently used names in Campsidium and Tillandsia and over 70 additions to Index kewensis. 
10.2307/1221213|The genus Disa is probably named after Queen Disa in a famous Swedish saga from the Uppsala area or, less probable, after the "disas," goddesses especially worshipped in Uppsala during pagan time.
10.2307/1221214|The type locality for the species Pyrola picta, P. dentata, and P. aphylla, collected by Menzies from the northwest coast of North America, has been considered to be Nootka Island, located on the northwest coast of Vancouver Island. A review of Menzies' journal of Vancouver's survey of the northwest coast during 1792 and other publications dealing with his voyage during the 1793 and 1794 seasons indicates that the type specimens could not have been collected at Nootka Island. Visits to the settlement at Nootka were made at the wrong times of the year for collecting flowering specimens. Menzies' journal for 1792 suggests that the probable collection site is Nipple Summit on West Redonda Island off the mainland coast of British Columbia. It is at the same latitude as Nootka, but about 150 km to the east.
10.2307/1221217|The purchase of a Sirius microcomputer by the Taxonomy section of the Plant Science Laboratories, University of Reading, England, has enabled the workload associated with the annual "Index Seminum" to be considerably eased. It is now managed by a single part-time trainee technician. One program stores all data and enables catalogue production, stock control and all addresses to be easily maintained.
10.2307/1221219|The purpose of this article is to present a short critique of the modern school of vicariance/cladistic biogeography. To achieve this aim recently published work on biogeographical methods and the southern beeches (Nothofagus) by Dr. C. J. Humphries is discussed in some detail.
10.2307/1221220| This paper is a reply to Heads (1985). In his attack on my previous publications (Humphries, 1981a, b) Michael Heads deliberately tries not to enter in the spirit of enquiry. So obsessed is he with the idea that everything written by Lon Croizat is of cardinal importance for biogeography that almost anything else with a different point of view is considered unscholarly. Although some of his comments on my paper are valuable, particularly those of a technical nature, his desire to take views out of context frequently gives rise to misunderstandings. 
10.2307/1221223| Goniotrichum Ktzing (1843) and Erythrotrichia Areschoug (1850), both being based on Conferva ceramicola Lyngbye (1819), must be regarded as nomenclatural synonyms. Since Erythrotrichia is a conserved name, Goniotrichum is automatically rejected. Diconia Harvey (1849), a taxonomic synonym of Goniotrichum, is rejected as invalid. Stylonema Reinsch (1875) becomes available to accommodate species formerly placed in Goniotrichum: S. cornu-cervi Reinsch, S. alsidii (Zanard.) Drew, and S. subcoeruleum (Dangeard) Wynne, comb. nov. 
10.2307/1221224| The specific name Juniperus monticola used in recent revisions is not correct according to the "International Code of Botanical Nomenclature." The name Juniperus sabinoides is restored for this species. Three forms are retained. One form requires a new name, J. s. forma monticola M. C. Johnst. One requires a new combination, J. s. forma orizabensis (Martnez) M. C. Johnst. 
10.2307/1221225|A taxonomic and nomenclatural study of pondcypress and baldcypress in the southeastern United States revealed the misapplication of a name. When pondcypress is treated as a variety rather than as a separate species, it should be referred to Taxodium distichum var. imbricarium (Nutt.) Croom rather than the commonly used var. nutans (Ait.) Sweet. The latter is placed in synonymy with the typical variety.
10.2307/1221226|In Farr, Leussink and Stafleu, Index Nominum Genericorum 2: 1185 (1979) the lectotype for the genus Notosceptrum Benth. (Liliaceae) is listed as N. alooides (H. Bol.) Benth., following Phillips, Genera of South African Flowering Plants ed. 2: 186 (1951). Reasons are given below for superseding this choice as unsatisfactory and for replacing it with N. benguellense (Bak.) Benth. as lectotype for the genus.
10.2307/1221227|L. C. Richard, not Persoon, is established as the correct author of the genus Hypolytrum. Hypolytrum latifolium Rich. and Hypaelyptum filiformis Vahl are selected here as lectotype species of Hypolytrum Rich. and Hypaelyptum Vahl, respectively.
10.2307/1221228|Sphaeria spina Schweinitz was cited by Berkeley as basionym for the new combination Sphaeronaema spina ('Sphaeronema spina') Berk. and Ravenel. This and subsequent transfers to other genera of coelomycetes ought to recognize this basionym for which an extant neotype is designated. Sphaeronaema spiniforme ('Sphaeronema spinaeforme') Berk. and Curtis is available for the microconidial anamorph of undetermined relationship. Interpretation of Sphaeria spina as a pyrenomycete is based upon a misunderstanding of its true nature. 'Sphaeronema' (spherical thread), a meaningless and misleading perversion of the original Sphaeronaema Fr.: Fr. (referring to the globoid gelatinous flux of extruded conidia), cannot be followed, Art. 75.
10.2307/1221230|Filipendula Miller is the correct name when Filipendula Mill. (1754) and Ulmaria Mill. (1754) are treated as congeneric. But Filipenduleae Schulze-Menz (1964), at the tribal rank, must be reduced as a taxonomic synonym of the tribe Ulmarieae Vent. (1799), for which the tribe Ulmarieae Focke (1888) is an isonym.
10.2307/1221232|The nomenclatural problems of two annual genera of Mesembryanthemaceae are due to the fact that the herbarium sheet, on which the description of the genus Cleretum N. E. Br. was based, contains parts belonging to two different genera. The names Cleretum N. E. Br. and Dorotheanthus Schwantes are determined to be correct; Micropterum Schwantes is a later synonym of Cleretum N. E. Br.
10.2307/1221233|Controversy exists in botanical literature concerning proper lectotypes for Langloisia Greene and L. setosissima (Torr. & A. Gray) Greene. Reasoning is presented here supporting selection of L. setosissima as the lectotype of Langloisia and Fremont 414 at NY as the lectotype of L. setosissima.
10.2307/1221234|Seven species of Lobostemon are given lectotypes. The types of the five sections of the genus are identified. Comment on the correct name of L. hispidum is provided.
10.2307/1221236|The following names are typified: Hordeum murinum L., Hordeum bulbosum L. and H. nodosum L. Arguments and details are provided in support of the findings. The first two retain their common usage, whereas the third is the diploid subspecies of H. bulbosum.
10.2307/1222197| Knowledge of precise publication dates for the instalments of a journal may be essential for nomenclatural purposes. In Vols. 1-25 of the "Bulletin de la Socit botanique de France" no such dates are recorded, nor can they be taken from the archives of the society which are no longer extant. In this paper publication dates are reconstructed from other sources. After a discussion of the complicated format of the "Bulletin," the method of reconstruction of the dates is explained. Special attention is given to the importance of the original covers of the instalments. For each of Vols. 1-25 the reconstructed publication dates, as well as some other bibliographical particulars, are assembled in a table. Notes for the tables present the evidence used for reconstruction of the dates. The unreliability of the year of publication as given on the title page of the volumes is shown. Some instalments of each volume were published in the next year only; this difference may increase to as much as four years. Temporal overlap of successive volumes often occurred: during a calendar year instalments of more than one volume were published in a sequence deviating from the sequence of the numbers of the volumes. When using bound volumes it must, moreover, be realized that from Vol. 11 the usual sequence of binding of the instalments differs significantly from their original sequence of publication. 
10.2307/1222198|Sieve-element plastids of Eucryphia are of the P-type, the characters of which are discussed in relation to its suggested position between the Connaraceae and Cunoniaceae. Paracryphia contains S-type plastids extremely similar in size and ultrastructure to those in the Dilleniaceae--Theaceae--Actinidiaceae.
10.2307/1222199| [French] L'tude caryologique effectue dans deux populations de Thymelaea hirsuta (L.) Endl. (Thymelaeaceae) du littoral mditerranen franais situes l'une en Camargue, l'autre dans les Albres, a permis de mettre en vidence une garniture chromosomique semblable  2n = 36 chromosomes. Ce rsultat est identique  celui trouv par les auteurs pour des populations du littoral gyptien. /// A caryological study conducted in two populations of Thymelaea hirsuta (L.) Endl. (Thymelaeaceae) of the French Mediterranean coast located one in Camargue, the other in the Albres, disclosed equivalent chromosome numbers, with 2n = 36 chromosomes. This result is similar to the one found by the authors for populations of the Egyptian coast. 
10.2307/1222200|Recent taxonomic investigation of the suprageneric classification of the Cyperaceae has made clarification of the nomenclature an urgent necessity. A list of the effectively published suprageneric names attributable to the Cyperaceae is presented here, with an indication of their nomenclatural status. For this purpose, a dichotomous identification key was constructed. Attention is drawn to various problems concerning the interpretation of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature with regard to the names of suprageneric taxa. Finally, two new tribes are described, Eleocharideae and Trilepideae.
10.2307/1222201|The nomenclature and typification of the sections in the genus Taraxacum Wigg. are discussed. The genus is typified by a specimen of Leontodon taraxacum from Linnaeus' Flora Lapponica for which the modern synonym is T. campylodes Hagl. This becomes the type of T. officinale Weber, and T. sect. Crocea M. P. Christiansen to which T. campylodes was assigned becomes a synonym of T. sect. Taraxacum. It is considered that the sections and subsections published by Handel-Mazzetti (1907) are validated in the table of contents in that work. The problems resulting from the earlier use of species in two different rank concepts in this largely agamospermous genus are highlighted, as are early incorrect citations, and recent transgressions of the ICBN. The sections of the genus are listed in full, with type species and synonymy. Two new sections are described, T. sect. Borea Sahlin and T. sect. Celtica Richards and Sahlin.
10.2307/1222202|The newly implemented curatorial type database system for the Flora of Veracruz project (Veracruz, Mexico) is described. The system consists of a main database containing over 80,000 entries from collections made in Veracruz, housed in several herbaria, and accessory bases containing a species checklist for Veracruz, standardized author abbreviations, and geographic localities in the state. The system permits on-line data entry or multiple access consultation, and is also used for the production of herbarium labels. Distribution maps are prepared automatically using the latitude and longitude provided by each record.
10.2307/1222203|The authors propose the use of a microwave oven as a new rapid procedure for herbarium specimen drying. A comparison between the new method and the usual procedure is presented and discussed with regard to external appearance and morphological characteristics.
10.2307/1222210|The name Palicourea galeottiana M. Martens is generally applied to the common yellow-flowered Central American species of Palicourea, but this usage is incorrect. Palicourea galeottiana is typified by two discordant elements, neither of which represents this yellow-flowered species. Based on Martens's original description, Galeotti 2602 is designated the lectotype of this name. Based on this choice, the new combination Psychotria galeottiana replaces the later synonym Psychotria persearum Standley & Steyermark; the correct name for the common yellow-flowered species is Palicourea padifolia (Roemer & Schultes) comb. nov.
10.2307/1222216|Acampe papillosa Lindley is an illegitimate name for A. praemorsa (Roxb.) Blatt. and McCann and A. carinata (Griff.), comb. nov. based on Saccolabium carinatum Griff. is proposed for A. papillosa auctt. non Lindley. Incidentally, A. multiflora (Lindl.) Lindl. is treated as conspecific with A. rigida (Smith) P. F. Hunt, in conformity with J. D. Hooker (1890), Seidenfaden (1977) and Jayaweera (1981).
10.2307/1222217|D. Don (Prodr. Fl. Nepal. 1825) studied unnumbered Nepalese materials distributed in 1818-1819 by Wallich to Lamberg but Don rarely annotated the specimens. The Lambert Herbarium was later (1842) acquired by the British Museum. Don's types (BM) can be recognized by notes on the back and contemporary annotations on the front by an unknown botanist (BM) with Don's names. A specimen (BM), annotated on the back as 'Gosaingsthan Wallich 1819' and on the front as Cymbidium longifolium D. Don, must be recognized as the type of Don's (1825) name, not Wallich 7356A, the latter representing Cymbidium longifolium Lindley (1833), non D. Don (1825).
10.2307/1222219|The illegitimate names subg. "Pircunia," its sect. "Pircunia," and sect. "Pircuniopsis" in another non-typical subgenus of the genus Phytolacca are changed to subg. Pircuniastrum, sect. Pircuniastrum, and sect. Pseudolacca. A lectotype is supplied for Moquin-Tandon's illegitimate generic name "Pircunia."
10.2307/1222220|Under the name Biscutella lyrata Linnaeus included two different taxa, one based on a Spanish plant and the other on a Sicilian plant figured in Boccone (1674, pl. 23). The specimen n. 831.3 in LINN, which is of Spanish origin, has been selected as lectotype of B. lyrata L. This specimen is the only element which agrees with the morphological characters specified in the protologue and, also, it was in the possession of Linnaeus at the date of publication of "Mantissa Pl. Alt." (1771). Biscutella lyrata, although disregarded by the Spanish authors, belongs really to the Spanish flora, while the Sicilian plant, figured in Boccone and cited by Linnaeus as synonym of B. lyrata, is a different taxon. The examination of its morphological characters suggests that it should be regarded as a distinct subspecies of B. lyrata with the name: B. lyrata L. ssp. maritima (Ten.) Raffaelli, stat. nov.
10.2307/1222223| Microcos L. is treated as a subgenus of Grewia L. Grewia microcos L. (1767) is recognized as nom. superfl. illeg., because Linnaeus (1767) cited M. paniculata L. (1753) as an obligate synonym. Due to prior existence of G. tomentosa Juss. (1804), G. paniculata Roxb. ex DC. (1824) has to be considered a 'nom. nov.' for M. tomentosa Smith (1813), although Candolle cited the latter as a direct synonym. In the circumstances, Grewia nervosa (Lour.) comb. nov. based on Fallopia nervosa Lour. (1790), the earliest available synonym, is proposed to replace G. microcos L. ( M. paniculata L.). 
10.2307/1222224|In the course of a phenetic study of Clarkia unguiculata Lindley and its relatives, nomenclatural problems concerning the typification of the genus Phaeostoma Spach and the typification of Clarkia sect. Phaeostoma Lewis & Lewis were discovered. Solutions to these problems are proposed here. In addition, two subsections within C. sect. Phaeostoma are described to accommodate two very distinct entities within this section: C. xantiana A. Gray and the C. unguiculata group.
10.2307/1221032|Identification techniques are discussed with particular reference to online keys. These are interactive keys in which a computer program selects successive questions from its database to guide the keyuser through an optimal identification course. Criteria that can be taken into account in selecting the optimum question at each stage include evenness of the split, the number of indeterminate database entries for each question, commonness of the species, and the part of the plant to which questions refer. Allowance can be made for user preferences and mistakes, and for inaccurate database entries. All such information can be accumulated over a number of identification sessions. This enables the program to improve its own performance, and points out sources of difficulty to the compiler of the database.
10.2307/1221033|Chromosome numbers of 12 genera and 13 species of the Lythraceae sens. str. were determined. Nine of 12 genera and 12 species are reported for the first time. An analysis of all published chromosome data including these new counts shows that 13 of 15 genera for which we could determine the base number have x = 8, and two remaining genera (Peplis and Lythrum) x = 5, thus confirming an earlier suggestion that the original basic number of the Lythraceae is x = 8. On the basis of evidence from chromosome number alone, Punica (x = 8) (Punicaceae) fits in well with the pattern of chromosome numbers in the Lythraceae, but Sonneratia (x = 9 or 11) and Duabanga (x = 12) (Sonneratiaceae) are more distinct and perhaps derived from a group ancestral to modern Lythraceae.
10.2307/1221034|Based on correlated gametophytic and sporophytic characteristics, 57 families of pleurocarpous mosses are classified in four orders. Four new families are recognized. Five families are segregated into a new suborder of the Bryales, the Rhizogoniineae. The remaining 52 families are arranged in three orders. Suborders and superfamilies are used to reflect the proposed phylogeny. A standardized ending for superfamilies, -acanae, is proposed. Each family is discussed, light microscope and scanning electron micrographs are provided to illustrate salient structural features, and cladograms are presented to summarize the classification.
10.2307/1221035|Natural populations of Juniperus silicicola were sampled from throughout the recorded range along the coast of North America. Additional populations of J. virginiana from inland sites were sampled. Morphological characters which have traditionally been used to separate the two taxa were measured along with analyses of the volatile leaf terpenoids. These data were analyzed by canonical variate analysis and contour mapping of the canonical variates. The amount of variation among inland populations of J. virginiana was comparable to the divergence of J. silicicola. The volatile leaf oils differed only quantitatively for a few components. Characters used in keys (female cone size, leaf tip shape) were not significantly different between the taxa. The populations in Texas, previously treated as J. silicicola, were found to be J. virginiana in both their morphology and chemistry. Some intergradation was found between the Macon, Georgia and Brunswick, Georgia populations. The coastal, foredune juniper of the southeastern United States (J. silicicola), being circumscribed within the range of variation encountered within J. virginiana, is treated as a varietas (J. virginiana var. silicicola (Small) Silba).
10.2307/1221036|Pollination systems in extant archaic angiosperms and cycads share three important characteristics. Based on these, it is suggested that insect pollination evolved primarily through meshing of the sexual life cycles of phytophagous insects with flowers in which floral odors served as chemical cues for mating sites and food. Floral fragrances may have originated from chemicals serving as herbivore feeding deterrents.

10.2307/1221038|Myriophyllum sibiricum Komarov 1914 is conspecific with M. exalbescens Fernald 1919 and replaces it. Using herbarium material from LE, the distribution of M. sibiricum and other Myriophyllum species in Siberia and the Far East is presented.
10.2307/1221039|Many, especially European, theses and dissertations were required to be issued in a printed version rather than as a typescript and so were available in fairly large numbers of copies. Discussion involves some bibliographic aids for getting into the thesis and dissertation literature, some sources for abstracts of the theses and dissertations, and some suggestions for citing these in bibliographies.

10.2307/1221041|An international cooperative project involving more than 16 resident botanists in tropical America was initiated in 1984 to attempt to resolve distributional, phylogenetic and classification problems in Bromeliaceae. The research project serves as a template for studies in other groups of organisms with tropical American distributions.
10.2307/1221048|Seventeen species and one genus of plants from New Zealand and the South Pacific were described and named by K. P. J. Sprengel in 1807. These are correctly typified by Forster specimens; consequently Sprengel's usage of several names differs from those of later authors who based their concepts of these names on Banks and Solander specimens. Where necessary and possible the names are lectotypified, and one new combination is provided: Glossogyne tannensis (Sprengel) Garnock-Jones.
10.2307/1221051|All valid combinations in the genera Zamia and Aulacophyllum are presented exclusive of those for West Indian species. The holotypes are identified, and, in those cases where no holotype has been found, a lectotype or neotype is designated.
10.2307/1221052| The problem of nomenclature and taxonomy of the genera Triticum, Aegilops and  Triticosecale has been discussed. It is proposed that Aegilops be recognized as an independent genus and not merged with Triticum. Similarly, it is proposed that  Triticosecale be not treated as a nothogenus and instead treated as a monotypic genus having a new name with proper circumscription and type specimen. This new genus will include only established cultivars and the nothogenus  Triticosecale will continue to be used restrictively for newly produced hybrids and related breeding material which has not reached the stage of a registered cultivar. 
10.2307/1221053|Vasey, in his Grasses of the Southwest (13 Oct. 1890), described and illustrated Bouteloua ramosa, crediting the authorship to Scribner. No specimen is cited, but in an account of G. C. Nealley's Texas grass collections published three months earlier (18 July 1890), Vasey lists B. ramosa, along with the note: "Chenate Mountains (Presidio County)." Comments in the literature are somewhat vague regarding the type of B. ramosa, although most authors state that it was a Nealley collection. Nevertheless, a Wilkinson specimen (at US) from Chihuahua, Mexico (not mentioned by Vasey) bears a note in Hitchcock's hand: "Taken as the type of B. ramosa Scribn....." It is argued here that the Nealley Chenate Mt. specimen is the type of B. ramosa since it was designated by Vasey as representing that species, even though in a publication which antedates his original description by three months.
10.2307/1221054|The lectotypification of Lepianthes Raf. with L. granulatum Raf. by Wilbur [Taxon 34(2): 287. 1985] is superfluous because this generic name has been previously and effectively lectotypified by Howard (J. Arnold Arb. 54: 380. 1973) with his choice of Piper umbellatum L. as the "TYPE SPECIES."
10.2307/1221055|Helleborus argutifolius was proposed as a species distinct from H. lividus Aiton (1789) by Viviani in 1824. Some authors have treated it at subspecific rank, but only now is a subspecific epithet validly published in combination with the earliest available specific name. A new combination is also made at (notho-)subspecific rank for hybrids between representatives of the two taxa. The remarkable discrepancy between H. lividus Aiton in Curtis (Jan. 1789) and H. lividus sensu Aiton, Hort. Kew. (Aug./Sept. 1789) is traced to an unacknowledged change of concept between the 6th and 7th editions of Miller's Gardeners Dictionary (1752, 1759). The nomenclatural status of the names applied to these plants by Schiffner (1889, 1890) and other authors is analysed.
10.2307/1221056| Bauhinia roxburghiana Voigt (1845), proposed as a nom. nov. for B. emarginata Roxb. ex G. Don (1832), non P. Miller (1768), nec Jack (1822), is established as taxonomically and nomenclaturally distinct from Bauhinia semla Wunderlin (1976) ( B. retusa Roxb. 1832, non Poiret 1811), notwithstanding Larsen and Larsen (1979) who treated B. semla Wunderlin as a superfluous illegitimate name for B. roxburghiana Voigt. Since B. retusa Roxb. ex DC. (1825) is conspecific with B. retusa Roxb. (1832) (although heterotypic), B. retusa DC., non Poiret, is reduced as a taxonomic synonym of B. semla Wunderlin. 
10.2307/1221057|A reevaluation of Nephropetalum shows that it is a synonym of Ayenia and that the sole species, N. pringlei, is conspecific with A. limitaris.
10.2307/1221060|Recent literature has adopted the combination Ipomoea multifida (Rafin.) Shinn. for the Cardinal Climber, a tetraploid ornamental morning glory. This name actually applies to the sterile diploid hybrids between I. coccinea L. and I. quamoclit L. that were the progenitors of the cultivated species. They cannot be considered conspecific with the latter and the combination I. sloteri (House) van Ooststr. should once again be adopted for the cultivated plant. The synonymy and typification of the two taxa are presented.
10.2307/1221069| A historical outline is presented with regard to the regulation of botanical nomenclature since the "Lois" of Alphonse de Candolle (1867). Attention is drawn to the fact that the subsequent "Rgles," largely promulgated by European botanists, were presented primarily in French with German and English translations until 1930. Since the 5th International Botanical Congress in Cambridge, the "Rules" (afterwards called "Code") have become truly international through a reconciliation of the American and European methods. The English version became the principal one from 1935 onwards and in 1956 it was declared arbitrarily correct in case of differences with the French and German texts. It is proposed that (1) the English wording of the Code (in case translations show any discrepancies) be declared the binding one in the Preamble rather than in the Preface; (2) the official English version of the Code be published separately, in order to produce it more speedily and at a lower price; (3) publication of the principal text of the Code in other languages (e.g. those regarded by UNESCO as major ones) be actively sponsored at an international level. /// [French] Une esquisse historique est prsente  l'gard de la codification de la nomenclature botanique aprs les "Lois" d'Alphonse de Candolle (1867). L'attention est attire sur le fait que les "Rgles" subsquentes, promulgues en grande partie par les botanistes europens, taient prsentes  l'origine en Franais avec des traductions allemandes et anglaises jusqu' 1930. Depuis le 5me Congrs International de Botanique  Cambridge, les "Rules" (dites "Code" par la suite) sont devenues vraiment internationales grce  la rconciliation entre les mthodes amricaines et europennes. Le texte anglais devint le principal  partir de 1935, et en 1956 celui-ci fut dclar arbitrairement correct en cas de diffrences avec ceux en Franais et en Allemand. Il est propos que (1) le texte anglais du Code (au cas o les traductions divergent) soit dclar  suivre obligatoirement dans le Prambule, plutt que dans la Prface; (2) la version officielle du Code en Anglais soit publie sparment, afin d'en acclrer la production et de la rendre moins coteuse; (3) la publication du texte principal du Code en d'autres langues (p.ex. celles regardes commes majeures par l'UNESCO) soit facilite activement sur un plan international. /// [German] Ein historischer Abriss der Regelbildung der botanischen Nomenclatur seit Alphonse de Candolles "Lois" (1867) wird vorgelegt. Es wird hervorgehoben, dass die darauffolgenden "Rgles", bis 1930 grossenteils von europischen Botanikern verfasst, ursprnglich in Franzsisch mit deutschen und englischen bersetzungen verffentlicht wurden. Nach dem 5. Internationalen Botanischen Kongress in Cambridge sind die "Rules" (spter "Code" genannt) durch Vereinigung der amerikanischen und europischen Methoden wirklich international geworden. Der englische Text war von 1935 an der massgebende, und 1956 wurde er willkrlich als richtig anerkannt falls Abweichungen in den franzsischen und deutschen Fassungen auftreten sollten. Es wird vorgeschlagen, dass (1) die englische Fassung des Codes (falls bersetzungen abweichen) in der Prambel, anstatt im Vorwort, als bindend erklrt wird; (2) die offizielle englische Fassung des Codes getrennt ausgegeben wird, um schnelleres und preisgnstigeres Erscheinen zu ermglichen; (3) bersetzungen des Codes in andere Sprachen (z.B. in die von UNESCO als wichtig bezeigneten) international untersttzt und ihre Verffentlichung ermglicht werden sollen. 
10.2307/1221264|Phenetic and cladistic methods were both used to study phylogenetic relationships of fungi in the genus Collybia section Levipedes. Ten North American taxa were scored for 23 morphological and ecological traits, and the resulting data set was used for both kinds of analysis. Essentially identical phenograms were generated regardless of the type of similarity or dissimilarity coefficient used. Both principal coordinate and minimum spanning tree analyses also produced results congruent with the various phenograms. For cladistic analysis, parsimony analysis was chosen to construct Wagner trees, which were rooted using several criteria. With only in-group taxa in the analysis, a single Wagner tree resulted when the dictum 'common is primitive' was used to root the tree. Outgroup taxa were chosen from sections Striipedes, Vestipedes and Maculatae. Of the various runs using outgroup taxa from different sections of Collybia, only that with section Striipedes as outgroup resulted in a single unequivocal tree being resolved. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that Striipedes is most closely allied to Levipedes. All parsimony analyses indicated a high level of parallelism in section Levipedes. Both phenetic and cladistic analyses grouped taxa in a similar manner, although several differences in branching pattern were apparent. The C. dryophila complex was clearly distinguished from the rest of the section by all analyses. Other close relationships were suggested between C. alkalivirens and C. fuscopurpurea, and between C. spongiosa and C. kaufmanii. The Wagner trees are presented as hypotheses of phylogenetic relationship in Levipedes.
10.2307/1221265| Zamia leaflet morphology is compared among three populations in Puerto Rico. The variables measured were leaflet length, width, area, length: width ratio, number of leaflets per leaf, and leaf area. One population (Susa) is highly significantly different in all variables from the other two populations. The Susa plants have much longer and narrower leaflets and more leaflets per leaf. This population represents what is known as the narrow-leaflet form and is considered by some to be a different species from the wide-leaflet form. The other two populations (Arecibo and Santa Rosa) represent the wide-leaflet form, although these two populations are significantly different from each other in all but one of the variables. The Arecibo plants have wider leaflets and more leaflets per leaf than the Santa Rosa plants. All four of the leaflet variables were non-normally distributed and various transformations of the data did not entirely solve this problem. In the few cases where transformation produced a normal distribution of the data, the variances were highly significantly heterogeneous. The failure of this type of data to meet the assumptions of parametric statistics may limit the usefulness of these characters for taxonomic studies. The results are further discussed within the context of Zamia taxonomy. 
10.2307/1221266| Vegetative characters of Isotes are generally thought to be of little diagnostic value because of their plasticity and limited number of distinctive character states. The neglect of these vegetative features has resulted in incomplete species descriptions and taxonomic confusion. This problem is exemplified by I. triquetra, a name based on a single sterile collection, which has previously been assumed, but never shown, to be synonymous with I. andina. A comparative study of ligule morphology indicates that the two names are indeed synonymous. 
10.2307/1221267| The publication dates of the instalments of Vols. 26-40 of the Bulletin de la Socit botanique de France belong to two different types. Dates for most fascicles of Vols. 26-32 could be reconstructed on the basis of internal and/or external evidence from several sources. For all fascicles of Vols. 33-40, as well as for some of Vols. 28-32, correct publication dates are available. The editors of the journal recorded those dates on the title-page of the cover of each instalment. In the present paper, for each of Vols. 26-40, the publication dates of the instalments, as well as some other bibliographical details, are assembled in a table. As was shown for Vols. 1-25 in a previous paper, in Vols. 26-40 too the year of publication on the title-page of the volume is unreliable. For each volume some instalments were published in the next year only. During a calendar-year temporal overlap of successive volumes often occurred. The usual sequence of binding of the instalments of a volume differs from their original sequence of publication. 
10.2307/1221268|The alterations made by W. J. Hooker while republishing Ferdinand Mueller's taxonomic papers (1854-1855) are treated. Mueller's rare preprint, "Definitions of rare or hitherto undescribed Australian plants," ignored by Australian botanists, from new evidence, predates most journal issues.
10.2307/1221269| Printed copies of C. L. Blume, Mlanges botaniques (1855) have been located. 
10.2307/1221270|The nomenclature of symbiotic dinoflagellates harboured by animal hosts is reviewed with regard to its history and employment. Zooxanthella, Philozoon, Zoorhabdella, and Endodinium may be regarded as synonyms of Amphidinium which has priority. Gymnodinium is considered to be incorrectly employed instead of Symbiodinium when applied to S. microadriaticum. Chrysidella is illegitimate. It is proposed to reject Zooxanthella as a confusing name widely applied to taxa not including its type. "The purpose of names is to act as vehicles of communication. It implies that names must be unambiguous and universal."
10.2307/1221271|Commonly used techniques for the preparation of plant surfaces for scanning electron microscopy involve either the use of coagulative fixatives such as FAA that are easily used in the field, but may cause specimen distortion, or else the use of noncoagulative fixatives such as glutaraldehyde or osmium tetroxide, that give excellent results but are difficult to use under field conditions. We have modified existing techniques that provide for relative ease of use in the field, low cost, and excellent results; they involve fixation in formaldehyde prepared from paraformaldehyde powder and dehydration in acetone.
10.2307/1221278|In view of increasing difficulty of access to type material and the problems of sending type material through the mail, use of correctly prepared homeotypes is suggested as a possible aid to taxonomists.
10.2307/1221279|Here is a plea for a more unambiguous citation of misidentifications; they should not be confused with homonyms. Second, for homonymic basionyms and names based on them, should they be saved or rather abolished once and forever?
10.2307/1221280|Adjectives (including participles) and nouns are regularly used as species epithets. Nouns maintain their gender and are grammatically independent of the generic name but adjectives indicate the gender of the generic name to the extent they have three, two or only one ending(s) in nominative singular. Generalizations and exceptions are presented with examples.
10.2307/1221281|Although Erythrotrichia Areschoug (1850) has been conserved against Porphyrostromium Trevisan (1848), these two generic names are heterotypic. The latter genus becomes available to serve for the new genus as established and circumscribed by Kornmann (1984) for Bangia ciliaris Carm. ex Harv. and Porphyra boryana Montagne. Erythrotrichopeltis Kornmann (1984) is to be regarded as a later synonym of Porphyrostromium.
10.2307/1221282| While preparing a floristic treatment of the red algal order Rhodymeniales in British Columbia and northern Washington, several names were found to be lacking holotypes or were incorrectly typified. Lectotypes are designated here for the following names: Botryocladia pseudodichotoma (Farlow) Kylin, Fauchea fryeana Setchell, Fauchea laciniata J. Agardh, Fryeella gardneri (Setchell) Kylin, Gastroclonium subarticulatum (Turner) Ktzing [=Gastroclonium coulteri (Harvey) Kylin], Leptofauchea pacifica Dawson, Lomentaria hakodatensis Yendo. 
10.2307/1221285|Examination of the holotype (BM) of Allium inodorum Aiton (1789), basionym of Nothoscordum inodorum (Aiton) Nicholson, reveals this as conspecific with Allium neapolitanum Cyrillo (1788) and not a member of the genus Nothoscordum Kunth (Alliaceae). The correct name for the widely naturalized weedy species known as N. inodorum or as N. fragrans (Vent.) Kunth is N. gracile (Aiton) Stearn, syn. Allium gracile Aiton (1789). The current misapplication of the epithet inodorum goes back to an illustrated article by Ker-Gawler in Curtis's Botanical Magazine 28: t. 1129 (1808) where N. gracile is depicted as A. inodorum; his later (1810) correction has been overlooked or ignored.
10.2307/1221286|Citation of Agrostis myuros Lam. as the type species of Hymenachne P. Beauv. by Farr et al. (1979) is established as an error. Similarly, selection of A. myuros Lam. [Hymenachne myuros (Lam.) Nees] is therefore no necessity to invoke Art. 14.8 (first sentence) which would have required proposal for conservation with A. monostachya as type cons. prop.
10.2307/1221287|Until recently names accepted by Rehder and Wilson (1913) for Magnolia species in Japan have commonly been followed. Magnolia obovata Thunb., which has been applied to the Japanese Umbrella Tree, is rejected as a superfluous, illegitimate name for M. denudata Desr. (=M. heptapeta) and M. liliiflora Desr. (=M. quinquepeta), and Magnolia hypoleuca Sieb. et Zucc. is accepted as the correct name.
10.2307/1221288|The names of two species of Magnolia should be changed as follows: M. tomentosa Thunb. should be accepted for M. stellata (Sieb. et Zucc.) Maxim. Magnolia praecocissima Koidz. must be accepted instead of M. kobus DC.
10.2307/1221290|The paper on two new Euphorbia hybrids which appeared in Kew Bulletin 40(2): 445 (1985) under my authorship recently appears to contain 2 names incorrectly formed according to the Sydney Code (1983), as has been pointed out by P. F. Yeo in a paper recently submitted to this prestigious nomenclatural journal. With my apologies for this lamentable lapsus cerebri come the needed rectifications. Furthermore, a number of extra terms governing hybrid-designation are used herein. Their use is self-explanatory.
10.2307/1221291|Fragariastrum (Ser. ex DC.) Schur (1853) is established as an isonym of Fragariastrum Heist. ex Fabr. (1759).
10.2307/1221292|Mimosa natans Linn. f. (1782) typified by 'Hab. in Tranquebar (1777), Koenig' s.n. (1228.4--LINN) is established as a validly described legitimate name, with its own type, not a nomen confusum. Since Neptunia natans (Linn. f.) Druce (1917) is a later heterotypic homonym of N. natans Theob. (1883) [as '(Willd.) Theob.'], N. triquetra (Willd.) Benth. is the correct name for the terrestrial taxon, M. natans Linn. f., the former based on Desmanthus triquetrus Willd. (1806) [Mimosa triquetra Vahl (1794), nom. illeg.; M. natans Linn. f.].
10.2307/1221294|Ellertonia Wight (1848, Apocynaceae) is an illegitimate renaming of Kamettia Kostel. (1834). Kamettia caryophyllata is a new combination for the taxon previously known as Ellertonia rheedei Wight, nom. illeg. pro Echites caryophyllata Roxb. (1814). Phrynium rheedei (Marantaceae) is a new name for Phrynium capitatum Willd., nom. illeg. pro Pontederia ovata L., non Phrynium ovatum Nees et Mart. (1823).
10.2307/1221296|On circumstantial evidence it is suggested that the hitherto unidentified name "Valentiana volubilis" Raf., based on a description of a plant grown from seeds collected in Ethiopia, is a synonym of Thunbergia alata Sims (Acanthaceae). No nomenclatural changes are necessary if this identification is accepted.
10.2307/1221298|Spermacoce hispida L. and S. articularis L. f., traditionally treated as conspecific are segregated and S. articularis reinstated. The circumscription of S. stricta L. f. and S. pusilla Wall., is elucidated and the taxon hitherto erroneously described under S. stricta is given a new name, S. ramanii.
10.2307/1221300|The generic name Mucor Micheli ex Linnaeus has been misapplied since 1850 and provides an earlier name for species presently referred to Rhizopus. The generic name Hydrophora, ignored by the majority of workers for over 100 years should be applied to species presently referred to Mucor. In the interest of nomenclatural stability proposals to conserve the names Mucor and Rhizopus as presently applied are presented.
10.2307/1221316|This is a formal proposal to change Art. 42 in order to explicitly allow--under certain circumstances--the validation of names of species in monotypic genera by reference to previously validly to Note 2, and therefore, Art. 42.2 applies and the species name proposed by De Candolle is therefore acceptable as validly published. Art. 42.2 then becomes Art. 42.3, with the numbering of Notes and Examples adjusted accordingly.
10.2307/1221900|First-40 amino acid sequences of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit are presented for six monocotyledons and two gymnosperms and are analysed together with previously published sequences of nine monocotyledons and two gymnosperms. In the resulting minimal phylogenetic tree, the gymnosperms are clearly separate from the monocotyledons with Ephedra closest to them. The families Poaceae, Commelinaceae, Arecaceae and Liliaceae (sensu lato) are separate although the last does not have a clearly defined origin. The two members of Alismatidae are closest to the origin of the monocotyledons. The majority of the tree agrees well with other taxonomies.
10.2307/1221901|A revision of Corner's (1976) classification of angiospermous (especially dicotyledonous) seeds is given in outline form according to the histology of the seed coat, namely, exo-, meso-, and endotestal seeds versus exo-, meso-, and endotegmic seeds. This revision is presented in the context of a historical perspective, and with certain explanations and caveats for the use of the classification. A digression pursues the terminology of the gymnospermous seed coat, in particular its division into sarco-, sclero-, and endotestal layers. An appendix lists published reviews of Corner's 1976 book "The seeds of dicotyledons".
10.2307/1221902|Two computer-assisted multiple entry keys, ANGIOFAM and TROPIFAM, are described. These keys, originally published as punched-card keys, have been converted to computer files. The Pascal algorithm MEKA (Multiple-Entry Key Algorithm) is used with these keys for the purposes of identification of specimens to family and the characterization and discrimination of groups of families. These keys can be obtained for use on most types of microcomputers.
10.2307/1221903|The genus Carex includes species with true vegetative culms as well as species with vegetative shoots that lack elongate stems. Two terms relating to vegetative shoots in Carex are precisely defined. A brief review of the variation in vegetative shoot form is presented and examples of the utility of vegetative shoots in the taxonomy of Carex are given. Vegetative shoots should always be obtained by collectors of Carex, and they should be utilized in taxonomic work. Specific suggestions regarding collection and description are provided.
10.2307/1221904|The concept of rarity in vascular plant species since the mid-nineteenth century is reviewed with the purpose of illustrating the history of ideas about rare plant taxa. Because much of the more recent literature concerning rare plants focuses rather specifically on isolated features of individual species, a "synthetic approach" incorporating several relevant causes and consequences of rarity in the genus Calochortus is presented. The results of this early synthesis serve to demonstrate the inadequacy of earlier generalizing hypotheses about rarity, and the need for the clarification of both the causes and consequences of rare plants, as well as the frame of reference.
10.2307/1221905| Haeckel outlined the first genealogical trees for plants and animals. A small portion of his work was dedicated to plant evolution. Haeckel gave a phylogenetic interpretation of the natural classification of plants as it existed at his time, deriving phylogeny from classification. According to him, a phylogeny based on comparative anatomy and upon which systematic evolution is founded, will be identical to that which could have been derived from ontogenesis or from paleontology if they had been known. /// [French] Haeckel baucha les premiers arbres gnalogiques des plantes et des animaux. Une petite partie de son oeuvre est consacre  l'volution des plantes. Haeckel a donn une interprtation phylogntique de la classification naturelle des plantes qui existait  son poque. Il retrace la phylognie  partir de la classification. Selon cet auteur une phylognie tablie d'aprs l'anatomie compare--sur laquelle se fonde l'volution systmatique--sera identique  celle que l'on aurait pu construire  partir des donnes de l'ontogense ou de la palontologie, si elles avaient t connues. 
10.2307/1221906|Two numerical parameters are used to estimate the karyotype asymmetry in twenty-two taxa of the tribe Aveneae (Gramineae) from the Iberian Peninsula and Baleares. The new method is useful when there are only slight differences in karyotype asymmetry and when karyograms or idiograms are available.
10.2307/1221907|Type specimens of Schizymenia? coccinea Harvey and Weeksia templetonii Setchell et Gardner, both of which are currently placed in the genus Halymenia (family Cryptonemiaceae), have been examined. All specimens were found to represent species of the genus Weeksia (family Dumontiaceae). The new combination Weeksia coccinea is proposed. An examination of the type specimen of Aeodes gardneri Kylin, which has been referred to Halymenia coccinea (Harvey) Abbott, confirms that it is a member of the Cryptonemiaceae and hence not conspecific with Weeksia coccinea. The name Halymenia gardneri (Kylin) Parkinson is available for this species.
10.2307/1221910|In a recent paper on taxonomic and biosystematic concepts, Wagner (1984) gives an inaccurate account of my treatment of the species in "Plant Speciation" (Grant, 1971, 1981).
10.2307/1221915|A strong light beam, transmitted through a herbarium specimen can often replace the somewhat risky softening of dried flowers. This method would be especially useful in the study of types and other material of special value.
10.2307/1221919|Twelve species of Potamogeton were named by Linnaeus in Species Plantarum. Only one of these, P. pusillus, has previously been lectotypified, although Dandy noted his choice of types on sheets in the Clifford Herbarium at BM and in notes at LINN. Eight lectotypes and three neotypes are chosen for the eleven taxa for which lectotypes have not been published. Dandy's choice of the type for P. natans is rejected because it contradicts the distributional portion of the protologue. The remainder of his choices are accepted, including that of P. pusillus, this latter choice having caused considerable discussions in the literature.
10.2307/1221920| Sarracenia  moorei Masters is shown to have priority over S.  mooreana Veitch, as the binomial for the hybrid between S. flava L. and S. leucophylla Raf. A neotype for S.  moorei is designated. Previously designated neotypes for S.  mooreana and S.  popei Masters, being in conflict with the ICBN, are superseded and a lectotype is designated for S.  popei. 
10.2307/1221921|All valid combinations in the genera Ceratozamia, Dion, and Microcycas are presented. The holotypes are identified, and, in those cases where no holotype has been found, a lectotype or neotype is designated.
10.2307/1221925|A lectotype for Juncus greenei Oakes & Tuckerman is selected from a series of syntypes.
10.2307/1221927|Citrus maxima and C. grandis are both currently used for the shaddock or pummelo. Although C. grandis (L.) Osbeck is more frequently used, C. maxima (J. Burman) Merrill is correct under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature.
10.2307/1221606|Many North American and Eurasian white pines retain their ability to hybridize even after long isolation, and about half of all white pine hybrids from controlled pollinations are inter-hemisphere crosses. Within the morphologically homogeneous and otherwise highly crossable core group of white pines, an exception in crossing behavior is Pinus lambertiana of western North America. Although it is an archetypal white pine in its winged seeds and long, unarmed cones that open at maturity, P. lambertiana has not been successfully crossed with any other species in the core group. It has been hybridized only with P. armandii and P. koraiensis, two natives of eastern Asia that do not resemble P. lambertiana or each other in the characteristics used to classify white pines. Both Asian species have seeds without wings, and P. koraiensis has indehiscent cones that retain the seed at maturity. Wingless seeds and seed-retaining cones may have evolved more than once as adaptations to seed dispersal by birds, and their taxonomic value is questionable. Lack of agreement among the kinds of data that bear on relationships of the white pines emphasizes the need for new approaches to their classification.
10.2307/1221607| Of the seven pines that compose subsection Oocarpae (Little and Critchfield) in the genus Pinus, only the three Californian species form a coherent group, while the other four differ from each other and from the Californian species. Traits of the Californian species (Pinus radiata, P. muricata, P. attenuata) vary in complex geographic patterns, a situation that has led to nomenclatural confusion. Modern studies of genetic varation clarified some relationships among the taxa and uncovered other new problems. The taxonomic history and present status are reviewed and discussed. Monterey pine has been described as Pinus californiana, P. adunca, P. Montereyensis, P. monteragensis, P. Sinclairii, P. tuberculata, P. insignis, and P. radiata. Numerous varietal names for the mainland populations were described, then dropped. Current understanding of this species describes pines at Ao Nuevo, Monterey, and Cambria as P. radiata var. radiata, pines on Guadalupe Is. as P. radiata var. binata, and on Cedros Is. as P. radiata var. cedrosensis. Complex variation in bishop pine led populations of that species to be called P. insignis, P. Edgariana, P. murrayana, P. contorta, and P. muricata. Present taxonomy describes central and southern populations as P. muricata var. muricata, populations north of (and including a few individuals at) Monterey as P. muricata var. borealis. The status of two cone variants, P. muricata var. stantonii and P. remorata is disputed on the basis of relationships among other traits. The latter appears to be a variant of bishop pine. Knobcone pine has been described as P. californica, P. tuberculata and P. attenuata. Only the latter name is currently used. 
10.2307/1221609|A new method for the experimental propagation of bryophytes involves drying the gametophytes, grinding them to a fine powder, and sowing the powder on native or other kinds of soil. The method is easy and rapid, and results in regeneration of normal morphology. The method can be applied to studies of systematic relationships among congeneric species, ecotypic differentiation, and competition.
10.2307/1221610|Paper conservation techniques were successfully used to restore severely flood-damaged herbarium specimens from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. A conservation assessment of the materials used for specimen preservation is made; some were found to be particularly unsuitable where permanence is required. Recommendations are given for improving general herbarium methods of specimen preservation.
10.2307/1221615|Syrrhopodon burmensis (Hampe) Reese & Tan is a new combination, based on Calymperes burmense Hampe, for S. robustiusculus (Broth.) Reese & Tan. New synonyms for this species include C. calcuttense Bartr. & Gangulee, C. saigonense Par. & Broth., and C. svihlae Bartr. This moss is endemic to southern and southeastern Asia.
10.2307/1221617|Attention is drawn to the fact, generally overlooked, that Bellardi prepared the descriptions for some of the 23 new species which he contributed to Flora pedemontana, but that it would appear that Allioni named them. The bearing of this on the typification of these names is discussed with particular reference to Poa cilianensis. It is concluded that Simon's lectotypification of this name is valid, because the lectotype was available to Bellardi when he drew up the description of the species. It is confirmed that Eragrostis cilianensis (All.) Janchen is the correct name for the widespread weed, stink grass.
10.2307/1221618|The original material of three species of Parietaria, P. capensis Thunb., P. lanceolata Thunb., and P. pilosa Willd., all described as from South Africa, has been studied. P. capensis Thunb. is lectotypified with a specimen which can be identified as Droguetia iners (Forssk.) Schweinf., a species indigenous to South Africa. The type material of P. lanceolata Thunb. can be identified as Pouzolzia zeylanica (L.) Benn., an Asian species. After study of type material, Parietaria pilosa Willd. is considered a synonym of P. judaica L., a basically Eurasian species. It is considered doubtful that the latter two species were described from material collected in South Africa.
10.2307/1221619|Lectotypes are designated for Morus alba, M. tatarica and M. indica. Morus tatarica is treated as synonymous with M. alba and following Bureau's treatment, M. indica is recognised as a variety of M. alba.
10.2307/1221623|Arbuteae Meisner and Andromedeae Endlicher are recognized as the earliest validly published tribal names for these two groups. The nomenclature of these suprageneric taxa is discussed.
10.2307/1221626|A new name, Habenaria indica Sathish Kumar et Manilal, and a new combination, Eria chandrasekharanii (Bhargavan & Mohanan) Sathish Kumar et Manilal, are proposed for two Indian orchids.
10.2307/1221627| A lectotype is selected for Usteria scandens Cav. The type is conserved in the Herbario del Real Jardn Botnico de Madrid (MA) and represents material on which the name was based. 
10.2307/1221628|Lobelia hirsuta L. is shown to apply to a South African member of Thymelaeaceae. The required new combination, Gnidia hirsuta (L.) Thulin, is made.
10.2307/1221629|A neotype is chosen for Lobelia erinus L. which enables this well-known name to be retained in its usual sense. A lectotype is chosen for L. erinoides L., and the repeated misapplication of the name is discussed. With the typifications proposed these two names apply to the same taxon. For this the name L. erinus is adopted and the simultaneously published L. erinoides is reduced to synonymy.
10.2307/1221653|Attention is drawn to name changes that could arise if lichen-forming fungi were subjected to sanctioning under Art. 13.1(d) of the Sydney Code. Eleven cases where name changes would occur are identified, several involving very familiar and widespread species. In addition four others could be required as a result of future taxonomic clarifications. Fourteen other sanctioned names are noted which do not cause an immediate threat to currently accepted names. In addition, there are 11 generic and four species names mentioned in the Introduction to the "Systema" which are not listed in the Index and which some mycologists would regard as unsanctioned; if they were not, three generic names could require conservation. Such changes are a small sacrifice to pay for avoiding the need to make biological decisions before applying the Code.
10.2307/1221660|In Sydney the possibility that a specimen (or other element) which is not the type of a species name, can be the type of a generic name, was discussed only in the context of the idealistic approach to generic names with so-called misapplied type species names. The idealistic approach involved taxonomic judgement, and Sydney rightly rejected it. The possibility of "unnamed types" (in Sydney accepted for nom. gen. cons. only) appears to be quite superfluous for conserved names, but it would be most valuable for the remaining generic names. Thus it has to be reconsidered, now outside that context.
10.2307/1221666|Proposals developed from the concepts of Hnatiuk and West on effective publication are made. For Spermatophyta, Pteridophyta, Bryophyta and Fungi provisions for a system of approved publications are proposed based on documentation centres which already provide the basic indexing services for different groups. These proposals could be introduced quickly with minimal change to current practice and little additional bureaucracy, would solve the problems of defining effective publication of names, and could provide a comprehensive accurate dating mechanism.
10.2307/1221670| It is proposed to make a clear distinction between nomenclaturally superfluous names, which are homotypic with a legitimate name and thus illegitimate, and names which are taxonomically superfluous when published, but not illegitimate, becoming correct as soon as the heterotypic synonym is excluded from the taxon concerned. To accomplish this, a slight modification of Art. 7.11 and an amendation of Arts. 63.1 and 63.3 are proposed. At the same time possible conflicts between Arts. 7.9 or 10.4 and 63.3 are eliminated. A clarification of Art. 6.4 is suggested, defining the words "according to this Code". Phegopteris (Presl) Fe is a legitimate name, which did not need a lectotypification, because it was typified already when published, through application of Art. 22.4. 
10.2307/1221674|In the logically convoluted language of Art. 64 of ICBN a homonym (which is a botanical name with multiple typifications) is written about as two or more different names, one "legitimate" and the rest "illegitimate". A proposal referred to the Special Committee on Orthography by the Sydney Congress to eliminate the language of legitimacy/illegitimacy from a straightforward matter of the correct and incorrect use of a name is revised and presented again, since the Special Committee has neglected to deal with it. A further proposal is made to divorce the material on homonymy from the material on parahomonyms (confusingly similar names) and to stop the confusing practice of "treating as homonyms(!)" quite distinct validly published and heterotypic names which simply happen to have a similar orthography. Such names should both be retained unless there are pragmatic grounds for rejecting one of them, and when this is necessary existing strategies for nomenclatural conservation are perfectly adequate.
10.2307/1221676|Definition of "major economic importance" is an indefinable concept, and leads to endless or inconclusive arguments on proposals to conserve particular specific names. Conservation of specific names has, in the past, been regarded as an unwise weakening of the ICBN, and still seems to be so. Hence the present proposal to restore the pre-1981 status quo limitation of Art. 14.
10.2307/1221677|Actions at the Sydney Congress, especially the addition to the Code of Art. 57.3, have given rise to strong differences of opinion and forced decisions regarding certain infraspecific names that went against the judgement of the proposers of the combinations affected. A discussion of the nature of autonyms, their logical nomenclatural status and limitations is provided. Modifications, especially in Art. 6.8, are proposed to make explicit the nature and limitations of autonyms that have been left implicit in the Code, and which may mitigate some of the objectionable features that have crept into the application of the autonym concept. It is proposed to delete Art. 57.3 and to make autonyms simply an automatic device to use in referring to the nomenclaturally typical element of a species or higher taxon.
10.2307/1221678|It is proposed to tighten up the wording of Art. 69.1 and Art. 69.2 to minimize the submission of proposals to reject names that are of only local interest geographically, or are bothersome to less than a major part of the botanical community or of the practical users of plant names, and thus, the committee work necessary to screen, approve, or disapprove such proposals. Alternatively, failing acceptance of the first two of these proposals, it is proposed to delete Art. 69 altogether.
10.2307/1221679|It seems undesirable to have the definition of correctness in an Article in the Code depend on a recommendation, which seems the case with Art. 73.8. It also seems undesirable to require that an epithet should even appear to be ungrammatical. Alternatives are proposed to correct these flaws in Art. 73.8 and Rec. 73G.1; it is also proposed, either to delete Rec. 73G.1 altogether or to revise it to remove inconsistencies and to make it understandable if it is retained in the Code.
10.2307/1221681|It looks as if the example of Art. 8 ICBN declares all choices of lectotypes made under the (ideas of the) American Code can be easily superseded. I tried to find out in which way it can be established if a certain designation of a type was 'largely mechanical'. This investigation revealed that many lectotypifications, made under the American Code, were not at all mechanical. Moreover, it is probably impossible to set up a starting date for American Code ideas, and it is certainly impossible to determine a closing date. The main root of all conflicting Britton and Brown/Hitchcock and Green choices seems to be the fact that Britton and Brown (and others) chose the historical type, even in cases in which this concerned a species that had been split off from the genus concerned already, while in the latter kind of cases Hitchcock and Green designated a 'substitute species', to retain the current concept of the genus. There is one conclusion possible only: the 'largely mechanical' criterion has to be deleted from Art. 8. The Seattle change in Art. 8 seems to have been made overhastily, without careful checking of the data, probably based upon bad reminiscence of the data. For cases in which acceptance of the Britton and Brown lectotype (or any other by an American author) would imply a change in the current concept of a genus, a solution might be found in two ways: In a number of cases, there is an earlier residue lectotype which retains the current concept of the generic name. It seems that at least for generic names, formal acceptance of the residue method would be very welcome. In other cases of conflicting lectotypifications, the addition of a Note in Art. 8 would give a way out. There is no communis opinio as to the question if Andrews in his 'Index of generic names of fossil plants' (1955, 1970), by simply mentioning "a type or representative species" (according to p. 5 of the Introduction of both editions) lectotypified many genera. In my opinion, it does not constitute lectotypification in the sense of the present Code. To settle once and for all with the idea that Andrews lectotypified all those genera, in Art. 8 a Note should be included, stating that only definite choices constitute lectotypification. This would solve the problem of different interpretations of other categories of doubtful lectotypification as well.
10.2307/1221345|Methods for shape comparisons among groups originally developed in zoological studies are found to be useful in examining variation in leaf shape. These methods (sampling outlines by means of truss networks connecting landmarks or pseudolandmarks, and sheared principal components analysis) take advantage of electronic methods of data capture and multivariate data analysis. They have the desirable properties of discriminating between shape variation and variation in size, and of permitting their results to be related directly to the original measurements from which they were obtained. The utility of these methods is demonstrated with respect to a search for possible leaf shape intermediacy in putative Crataegus hybrids, and an examination of geographic variation in the cross-sectional shape of Larix laricina needles.
10.2307/1221346|The purpose of this note is to bring into focus the morphological and evolutionary relationship between spiral anthotaxy and pentamerous, trimerous and dimerous whorls. The trimerous as well as the pentamerous condition has its morphological and evolutionary origin in spiral anthotaxy, and slight morphogenetic changes are responsible for the switch from spiral to whorled anthotaxy, the latter including pentamery, trimery, and rarely dimery. A pentamerous whorl is considered to be morphologically equivalent to two alternating trimerous or dimerous whorls. The transition from spiral to whorled anthotaxy is documented in several extant families of the Ranalean complex and must have taken place in parallel in various--albeit related--evolutionary lines. Except for its predominance in the monocotyledons and frequent occurrence in the Ranalean families trimery is relatively rare in other dicotyledons, and its morphogenetic origin may be different in these two major groups. It is proposed that trimery is a morphological constraint, which offers only very limited possibilities for meristic variation, with no return to pentamery or spiral anthotaxy possible.

10.2307/1221349|An account of Rev. Richard Baron's "Compendium des Plantes Malgaches" (1900-1906) is presented. Brief biographical notes concerning Baron's missionary career in Madagascar and his botanical collecting and research explain the origin of his interest in cataloging the Malagasy flora. Information on the sources, publication history, numbering of fascicles, and format of the Compendium is provided. Finally, the importance of Baron's Compendium is discussed and the Compendium is compared with subsequent efforts to catalog the vascular flora of Madagascar.
10.2307/1221350|Corrigiola and Telephium resemble each other in many features, particularly in leaf arrangement and stipule form. Both have been most frequently included in the Caryophyllaceae, but are anomalous in features of leaf, stipule and fruit. The anomalies are least when both genera are included in the Molluginaceae. Nevertheless discrepancies and omissions in existing generic treatments of this complex of families indicate the need for an overall generic revision of the anthocyanin-producing centrosperms.

10.2307/1221361|Long-term ideas for achieving greater stability of names of plants are reviewed. It is suggested that lists of recommended names covering the whole flora of the world, which would take precedence over any names not so listed, might become an attractive proposition in the future. However, this would not solve problems arising from typification difficulties, which might currently be responsible for about half the upsets of established names.
10.2307/1221364|Loudon's "Hortus Britannicus," Part 1 (1830) is a catalogue of the native and cultivated plants of Great Britain. Sections and subsections are validly named and briefly diagnosed for most of the larger genera. Because of the early publication date of the book, these names (none of which was typified) have priority over many of the sectional and subsectional names currently in use. Types are indicated and, where needed, lectotypes are designated for the seven sectional names under Aster.
10.2307/1221365|The hitherto unnamed plant illustrated by Merian (1705) in her plate LIII is Drymonia serrulata (Jacq.) Mart. (Gesneriaceae). A comment is made on factors contributing to the long delay in obtaining this determination.
10.2307/1221366| Manitz (1968) stated that 42 species names have been validly published in Dennstedt's "Schlssel" (1818), but that another 48 names are to be regarded as "nomina nuda". It is argued here that an additional 14 species names are validly published, shifting the balance to 56 compared with 34 nomina nuda. Although no generic names were validly published by Dennstedt himself, 3 were validated by others and 4 were applied subsequently to other taxa, whereas 2 of his genera were renamed by Rafinesque. 
10.2307/1221369|Gustavo Venturi (1830-1898) wrote 20 articles on the taxonomy of the moss genus Orthotrichum. In these papers, as well as in contributions of new taxa to papers by prominent bryologists of his era, he described 19 species, 3 subspecies, and 48 varieties. Included in these new taxa, were plants from Australasia, North America, the Himalayas, the Caucasus, and Europe. His herbarium at Trento (TR) has not been available for study since his death. This paper presents typification of the names of the most important of Venturi's taxa, including 18 species, one subspecies and seven varieties.
10.2307/1221370|The lectotype of Potamogeton illinoensis is a specimen collected by H. N. Patterson near Oquawka, Illinois, in 1873 and currently at NY. This was originally designated as such by J. L. Reveal and R. R. Haynes, but their choice was never published.
10.2307/1221371|Since Howard (J. Arnold Arb. 54: 380. 1973) did not designate a lectotype for the generic name Lepianthes Raf., it is argued that the first explicit and effective lectotypification of the name is Lepianthes granulosum (Ruiz & Pavon) Raf. (=Piper granulosum Ruiz & Pavon). Lepianthes Raf. is then a synonym of Piper L. and not a prior name for Pothomorphe Raf. (Piperaceae).

The typotype has been based on specimen 2868 of the Dillenian Herbarium of the "Hortus Elthamensis" (OXF). We consider the sources of the Euphrates and the surroundings of Erzurum (Turkey) as the type locality of this species. A description, based on specimens collected from natural sites, is presented.

In this paper I shall the consider the description and identity of this most interesting plant.
10.2307/1221377|Salpichroma Miers is not an orthographic variant of Salpichroa Miers but nomenclaturally distinct, though superfluous and illegitimate when published. Salpichroa origanifolia is shown to be the correct name for the weed, cock's eggs, to which the name S. rhomboidea has been applied. The correct citation is S. origanifolia (Lam.) Thell.
10.2307/1221380|A lectotype is designated for Kohautia nagporensis (Brace ex Haines) Santapau et Merch. (based on Oldenlandia nagporensis Brace ex Haines), a taxon listed in Flora British India by Hooker f. (1880) as O.? senegalensis Hiern. The history and nomenclature of this rare little-known Indian species are discussed.
10.2307/1221382|The status and typification of five species names and two varieties described by Linnaeus in Lactuca, are discussed. Six new lectotypes are designated; one by material at LINN, one by a van Royen specimen in L, three in the Burser Herbarium (UPS), and one plate of Bauhin (L. scariola). An existing typification for Lactuca serriola is discussed.
10.2307/1221394| The name Corydalis bulbosa has been used in several modern European Floras in the sense of C. cava (L.) Schweigger & Krte, but more recently the Committee for Spermatophyta has formed a majority opinion that it should be rejected as illegitimate. Both views are incorrect. Corydalis bulbosa (L.) DC. is a senior synonym of C. solida (L.) Clairv., and is here proposed for rejection under Art. 69. 
10.2307/1221429|Interrelationships of major groups of green algae and land plants are currently hypothesized in cladograms by various authors. A summary cladogram is given and controversial points such as the precise sister group of the land plants are indicated. Sequence data from 5S ribosomal RNA are more homoplasious than morphological data and hence less useful for inferring phylogeny. Traditional textbook classifications contain several paraphyletic taxa and are frequently uninformative with respect to interrelationships/phylogeny. A cladistic classification with monophyletic taxa is advocated. It is superior for teaching purposes and provides natural taxa that are meaningful for biology in general.
10.2307/1221430|The typification of the 112 Linnaean generic names dating to 1753, for which American Code lectotypifications differ from later ones, is reviewed in the light of two proposals to amend the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature at the XIV International Botanical Congress at Berlin in 1987. As part of the review, Dioscorea sativa L. is lectotypified and thus synonymized under D. villosa, and Agrostis alba L. is placed in synonymy under Poa nemoralis L. The two proposals (Proposals 291 and 297) were both included in the report of the Committee on Lectotypification, and are found to have differential effects in 58 of the 112 cases examined. It is shown that adoption of the provision to remove all constraints on the priority of American Code lectotypifications would result in nomenclatural changes in 48 cases as against 10 if the proposal to adopt 1935 as the starting date for priority of lectotypification was adopted. Moreover, with priority of American Code lectotypifications, changes would arise in the names of subdivisions of families in 4 cases and in names very widely accepted at the generic level in 21 cases, whereas no such changes would occur if a 1935 starting date were adopted. The generic names involved include Agrostis, Andropogon, Apium, Cleome, Cucurbita, Draba, Elymus, Ophrys, Scabiosa, Scirpus and Sisymbrium. At the infrageneric level (including 7 cases in which a few authors recognize segregate genera), changes would be required in 26 cases if Proposal 297 (American Code priority) were adopted on its own, but in only 10 if Proposal 291 (1935 start) were accepted. The authors conclude that stability of nomenclature, at least at the levels of genera and subdivisions of genera of phanerogams, is better served by establishing 1935 as the starting date for priority of lectotypification.

10.2307/1221433|The compacting system at BISH is reviewed and the statistics concerning it are provided. The carriage and case system that was developed has worked out extremely well and has provided an increase of 86.3% in storage capacity in the area compactorized. Concomitant with this was an increase of 51% in counter and table space. Our experience has shown this kind of system to be extremely efficient in cost, storage capacity, and user access.
10.2307/1221434|High density storage of botanical and mycological specimens was achieved by using specially built, open-faced cabinets on electrically operated, compactor mobiles. By utilizing as much height as possible and allowing two aisles per compactor module (block), 2-3 times as much space was obtained as in conventional herbarium storage. The largest module comprises 11,200 pigeonholes on 16 double carriages and three single carriages each 18 ft long and 9 ft 2 in. high. The reduced aisle space was made practical by the use of a totally flexible aisle system where one wide or two smaller aisles can be placed anywhere in a module. Protection from insects and air tightness was obtained by use of a highly compressible, perimeter gasket around cabinet faces. Decks (false floors at rail height) were made of concrete in the basement and wood in the upper floors. Independently operated safety features include a floor-level sweep and a locking mechanism for the aisles. Calculations on the weight of compactors, for purposes of floor loading, are given.
10.2307/1221435|Formerly known as the Fiji Herbarium, the only herbarium in the Fiji Islands, SUVA, was founded by B. E. V. Parham in 1933. Consisting of more than 25,000 specimens, the herbarium is one of the leading collections of vascular plants and bryophytes in the South Pacific. Recently renamed "The South Pacific Regional Herbarium", SUVA serves the member countries of The University of the South Pacific which include the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Niue, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and Western Samoa. Historical events and important contributions to SUVA are noted in this paper. Finally, the goals and projects within the herbarium are presented, with the purpose in mind of increasing the cognisance of the international community of taxonomic botanists toward the importance of SUVA.
10.2307/1221445|The type of Pilinia rimosa Kuetzing 1843 (hitherto Chlorophyceae) has typical phaeophycean chloroplasts and sporangia, and is identical with Waerniella lucifuga (Kuckuck) Kylin (=Leptonema lucifugum Kuckuck, 1897) (Phaeophyceae). Waerniella lucifuga is therefore placed in synonymy with Pilinia rimosa, which is transferred to the Phaeophyceae (Ectocarpaceae).
10.2307/1221446|The typification of Juniperus barbadensis and J. bermudiana is discussed in relation to specimens in the Linnaean collections and specimens recently collected from the type localities. The specimen in LINN numbered 1198.1 is designated as the lectotype of J. barbadensis L. The specimen 1198.2 at LINN annotated J. bermudiana was apparently added to the Linnaean collection after 1753. The Hermann illustration cited by Linnaeus was not based on J. bermudiana and would fail to establish effectively the application of the name. Therefore, a specimen taken from a plant that was contemporary with Linnaeus, David van Royen 901.130-394(L), is designated as the neotype for J. bermudiana. The rediscovery of J. barbadensis is reported from St. Lucia, BWI. This species should be considered threatened on St. Lucia due to its small population of approximately 25 trees that occupy an area of about 10 m by 60 m.
10.2307/1221447| A brief history of the wheat-rye hybrid triticale is provided, and an as complete as possible list of published names referring to this taxon is annotated with nomenclatural details. Only 2 of 6 generic names and 2 of 33 specific names appear to be valid and legitimate. The correct nothogeneric name for plants derived from Triticum  Secale crosses is  Triticosecale Wittmack ex A. Camus. No correct name at species level is available for the commonest crop triticales. It is recommended that crop triticales be named by appending the cultivar name to the nothogeneric name, e.g.  Triticosecale 'Newton'. 
10.2307/1221448|Examination of the type collections of Purshia subintegra (Kearney) Henrickson, a critical and necessary step, during the study of apparent hybridization between central Arizona Purshia, revealed that a holotype had not been designated by Kearney for the basionym, Cowania subintegra. Additionally, it was found that, though a holotype had not been designated, isotypes had been recognized. Label data of all specimens bearing the isotype designation was found to be discordant with Kearney's protologue in site location and, excepting POM 282632, collection number. The specimen accessioned as ARIZ 93633, one of two Cowania subintegra specimens (Darrow and Benson 10891) at ARIZ, is designated lectotype.
10.2307/1221450| Miguel Ramrez Goyena published in the first volume of his Flora Nicaragense (1909) the genus Pochota and its only species, P. vulgaris, which is clearly identifiable with the species well known today by the name Bombacopsis quinata (Jacq.) Dugand, and the species is herein neotypified. Bombacopsis Pittier (1916) was twice proposed for conservation over Pochota Ramrez Goyena and was twice unanimously rejected. Between the first rejection and the second, a new combination in Pochota was made for the one Old World species but otherwise this nomenclatural problem has dropped out of sight, presumably because it was suggested in the second proposal that Pochota and Bombacopsis were not equivalent. It is here proposed that there can be no doubt of the equivalence of Pochota and Bombacopsis and suggestions to the contrary were perhaps an expedient to avoid the consequences of the rejected conservation. Two of the 28 new combinations necessitated by this interpretation are here proposed. 
10.2307/1221451| Nerium antidysentericum L. (1753), through partial lectotypification, by R. Brown (1810a), with Herb. Hermann, vol. 4: 76 (BM), has been treated, of late, as the basionym of Wrightia antidysenterica (L.) R. Br. [=Walidda antidysenterica (L.) M. Pichon], a species endemic to Sri Lanka. Although Wallich (Num. List No. 1672. 1829) explicitly excluded Hermann (Ceylonese) material from Holarrhena antidysenterica (L.) Wall. ['Echites (antidysenterica) (L.) Roxb. haud Wrightia antidysenterica R. Br.'], the current consensus is to accept R. Brown's earlier lectotypification, as it is not in conflict with Art. 8.1. Consequently, Echites antidysenterica (L.) Roxb. ex Fleming (1810), non sensu Fleming, E. antidysenterica (L.) Roxb. (1814), non sensu Roxb., as also Holarrhena antidysenterica (L.) Wall. (1829), non sensu Wall., are reduced here as nomenclatural synonyms () of Walidda antidysenterica (L.) M. Pichon (Art. 7.10; Art. 55.2). Since E. antidysenterica Roth (1819) is nom. illeg. (Art. 64.1), the next available name for the widespread Indian taxon is Echites pubescens Buch.-Ham. (1822) [=Holarrhena pubescens (Buch.-Ham.) Wall. ex G. Don (1838)]. 
10.2307/1221461|For the past 45 years the name Echium lycopsis L. (1754) has been used in many works in the sense of E. plantagineum L. (1771), i.e. for the important Southern Hemisphere weed referred to in Australia and New Zealand as Paterson's Curse or Salvation Jane and known in the northern hemisphere as Purple Viper's Bugloss. As Stearn's lectotypification of E. lycopsis by Dodoens's figure of Echii altera species must be accepted as the first under Art. 8.1 of the ICBN and as Dodoens's figure is referable to E. asperrimum Lam. (1792), it is established that E. lycopsis cannot now be used in the sense of E. plantagineum. It is concluded that E. lycopsis has been widely and persistently used for a taxon not including its type and it is therefore proposed that the name be placed on the list of nomina rejicienda.
10.2307/1221846|The interpretation of the phylloclade of Phyllocladus by Keng (1974) as an ancient link between lateral branch systems of progymnosperms and the simple leaves of modern conifers is critically examined in the light of patterns of vascularisation, and his erection of the monogeneric family Phyllocladaceae (Keng, 1973, 1978) is challenged.
10.2307/1221847|Mathieua and Plagiolirion are two poorly known, monotypic genera of petiolate-leaved neotropical Amaryllidaceae that have been variously treated as synonyms for Eucharis, Urceolina or Hymenocallis subg. Elisena. Taxonomic history, morphological characters, phytogeography, and ecology of both genera are reviewed. From the available data, Mathieua appears most closely related to Stenomesson. Plagiolirion shows greatest relationship to Hymenocallis subg. Elisena. The supposition that Linden's combination of Eucharis galanthoides was based on Mathieua galanthoides is shown to be false, and E. galanthoides is declared a nomen nudum. The significance of a number of rare and small or monotypic genera of Amaryllidaceae in the northern Andes, with characters intermediate between various larger genera, is discussed.
10.2307/1221848| Attempts to infect the four cytodemes of Anthoxanthum odoratum L. s. lat. (Poaceae) with Puccinia sardonensis Gumann (Uredinales) were successful with half the individuals of A. alpinum A. & D. Lve (diploid and tetraploid) but not with those of A. odoratum s. str. (diploid and tetraploid). For each cytodeme, the sensitivity to the parasite was not dependent on the origin of the material and no correlation was established between the distribution of the rust and that of susceptible individuals. Susceptibility and resistance to P. sardonensis would therefore probably be long-established characteristics which originated at the time of differentiation of the two diploid taxa of A. odoratum s. str. and of A. alpinum but which preceded their respective polyploidization phases. Resistance to infection would have no adaptive value since resistant A. odoratum is not exposed to infection in nature and probably never has been. These results support the division of A. odoratum s. lat. into A. alpinum and A. odoratum. ///[French] Des essais d'infection des quatre cytodmes d'Anthoxanthum odoratum L. s. lat. (Poaceae) par Puccinia sardonensis Guman (Urdine) russissent sur la moiti des individus d'A. alpinum A. alpinum A. & D. Lve (diplodeet ttraplode) mais jamais sur ceux d'A. odoratum s. str.

10.2307/1221849|An enigmatic, highly localized endemic of the Far-Eastern USSR was first considered a species of Medicago, subsequently transferred to Trigonella, and most recently elevated to the monotypic genus Ursia Vass. Its affinities, however, are with Trifolium, particularly with T. eximium, but also with the only sympatric indigenous clover, T. lupinaster.
10.2307/1221853|Buchoz (1779) published the genus Lassonia with two species, L. heptapeta and L. quinquepeta based on plant figures of Chinese origin first published by Buchoz in 1776. Only the Chinese vernacular names Yulan and Xinyi (or Mulan) appear on the original plates. In 1934, Dandy transferred both L. heptapeta and L. quinquepeta to the genus Magnolia, but these names of Buchoz were later rejected by him in preference of Magnolia denudata and M. liliiflora of Desrousseaux. More recently the Buchoz names have been resurrected by several authors which has resulted in a running controversy over the Buchoz names as to their application in the genus Magnolia. In fact, the figures themselves are without any redeeming botanical value whatsoever, as a close scrutiny of the figures reveals. The names Magnolia heptapeta (Buchoz) Dandy and M. quinquepeta (Buchoz) Dandy are categorically rejected as incertae sedis, because the Buchoz figures do not match the species to which some people apply his names, thus leaving the names unapplied and without identifiable types. The earliest applicable names for the taxa in question with the Chinese names Yulan and Mulan are Magnolia denudata and M. liliiflora, respectively, both of Desrousseaux (1791), based on the earlier illustrations of Kaempfer.
10.2307/1221855|The sectional nomenclature in Taraxacum (Cichoriaceae) is discussed (cf. Richards, Taxon 34:633-644, 1985). The status of Dahlstedt's sectional names and their typification are dealt with. Results of this analysis are compared with infrageneric taxa published by Handel-Mazzetti (1907) and with the Richards paper. Attention is paid to the typification of the sections Palustria, Borealia, Ceratophora, Erythrosperma and Subvulgaria. The name T. sect. Vulgaria (Dahlst.) Dahlst. is shown to be illegitimate; a new section is described to accommodate the most common group of dandelions in central and northwestern Europe. A list of corrections and additions to the Richards sectional list is added.
10.2307/1221857|Typification is established or reviewed for the names of Pontederia (Pontederiaceae) published by Carl Linnaeus. It is concluded that the lectotype of Pontederia is P. cordata. The correct name for Pontederia ovata L. is Phrynium rheedei Suresh & Nicolson (Marantaceae) and for P. hastata L. Monochoria hastata (L.) Solms-Laubach (Pontederiaceae). Pontederia rotundifolia L. is correct.
10.2307/1221858|As part of a taxonomic study of cultivated Brassica, B. rapa L. is lectotypified by a Matthiolus illustration, the lectotype of B. campestris L., chosen by Jonsell, is restricted to a single specimen in LINN and a neotype is designated for B. chinensis L. from the Bailey Herbarium.
10.2307/1221860|The typification of the seven species names published in the genus Globularia by Linnaeus has been studied. One of these, G. orientalis, has already been typified by a specimen in LINN. The remaining six names are typified. Three are lectotypified by specimens in LINN, one by a specimen in the Burser herbarium (UPS), and another by a Plukenet illustration. A neotype is proposed for G. spinosa.
10.2307/1221862|Crataegus fontanesiana (Spach) Steudel is a synonym of C. calpodendron (Ehrhart) Medicus. C. tenax Ashe is the correct name for the taxon hitherto misidentified as C. fontanesiana.
10.2307/1221863|Neotypification of Ornithopus sativus results in a restructuring of its two subspecies and the need for two new combinations: O. sativus subsp. isthmocarpus (Cosson) Dostal falls into synonymy with O. sativus Brot. subsp. sativus and what was called O. sativus Brot. subsp. sativus becomes O. sativus subsp. roseus (Dufour), comb. nov. Also, O. sativus var. macrorrhynchus (Willk.), comb. nov., is recognized.
10.2307/1221121|The computer program, EXPERT KEY, is an application of expert-systems technology to the problem of biological identification. The user can use easily-obtained information about an unknown specimen's colour, location, habitat, etc. to minimise the subsequent search through an ordinary dichotomous key. EXPERT KEY uses the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence, a method of reasoning with uncertainty, to combine the heuristic rules. Uncertain inference is also used to allow the user to express lack of certainty about the statements in the key. The system can reduce considerably the number of difficult key couplets which a user has to assess to make an identification. Unlike previous computer programs in this field, EXPERT KEY is aimed at the non-specialist who may have problems with technical terms and microscopic examination.
10.2307/1221122|A major obstacle facing many taxonomists interested in analyzing variation at the DNA level is the preservation of their plant material, since plants are often collected far from laboratory facilities. We have studied effect of several commonly used preservation techniques on the quality of DNA isolated from preserved tissue. Chemical treatments (FAA, ethanol, Carnoy's solution, chloroform-ethanol) all result in DNA degradation; drying tissue, on the other hand, preserves DNA integrity, at least over a several month period. High molecular weight DNA suitable for restriction endonuclease digestion and analysis by DNA hybridization was isolated from dried leaves up to two years old. This suggests that recently-prepared dried specimens may represent an alternative to fresh tissue in molecular plant systematic studies.
10.2307/1221123|The history of classification of the genera Acorus and Gymnostachys, generally considered to constitute the tribe Acoreae in the family Araceae, is briefly reviewed. Phenetic data appearing to have an important bearing on the placement of these genera are summarized in Table 1, and discussed more fully in the text. These data are interpreted as supporting the removal of Acorus to its own family, while favoring the retention of Gymnostachys in Araceae.
10.2307/1221126|The Committee for Pteridophyta recommends the rejection of both propsal 807 to reject Polypodium pteridioides Reichard, and proposal 839 to reject Asplenium laciniatum D. Don.
10.2307/1221127|Usage of -colus and -colum is to be changed to -cola under Art. 32.5 (incorrect Latin terminations), cross-referenced by Art. 73.1, and as exemplified by Rubus amnicola (originally 'amnicolus') in Ex. 4 under Art. 23.5. This affects epithets based on colo or incolo (dwell), whether with substantival sense (dweller in or on) or adjectival (dwelling in or on).
10.2307/1221130|A nomenclatural revision of some Mediterranean algae has been carried out. Fifteen new combinations are proposed.
10.2307/1220932| Part I: Louis Grard (1733-1819); his development of a system of natural classification; the "Flora Gallo-Provincialis" (1761) and its fate. Part II: The progress of the idea of natural classification in the later eighteenth century; the cult of sensibility vs. the cult of reason; and the academic politics of the French Revolution. Part III: Jean Henri Jaume Saint-Hilaire (1772-1845) and his "Exposition des familles naturelles" (1805); the task of popularizing natural classification; and a new role for botany in the democratization of society in the nineteenth century. 
10.2307/1220933| For each of Vols. 41-61 of the "Bulletin de la Socit botanique de France" the publication dates of the instalments, as well as some other bibliographical particulars, are assembled in a table. For most instalments an editorial note with information about the precise or approximate publication date was available. In several cases more precise publication dates were obtained through reconstruction on the basis of internal and/or external evidence from several sources. As was shown earlier for Vols. 1-40, in Vols. 41-61 too the year of publication on the title page of the volumes is unreliable. For each volume some instalments were published in the next year only, or even still later. During a calendar-year temporal overlap of successive volumes often occurred. The usual sequence of binding of the instalments of a volume differs from their original sequence of publication. The "Mmoires de la Socit botanique de France", which sometimes are considered to constitute an independent serial, actually are an integral part of the Bulletin. In this paper the Mmoires published with Vols. 52-61 are treated in the same manner as the other instalments of those volumes. A survey of Mmoires 1-26, with pagination and publication dates, is added. 
10.2307/1220934|A new procedure for coding quantitative measurements and ranges of measurements onto discrete characters suitable for input into existing cladistic analyses programs is presented. The procedure consists of rank ordering the ranges by their minimum values first, then by their midrange values. The rationale for coding ranges is presented and justified from the taxonomist's point of view. A detailed example is given and tested on a data set consisting of nine species of the genus Hordeum. Cladistic programs that deal directly with intra-OTU variability are needed.
10.2307/1220935|The fruit of the cultivated ulluco (Ullucus tuberosus Loz.) has been referred to in the literature either as non-existing or as a berry, seldom as a dry fruit. The fruit of this species as well as the genus is described here for the first time, and is shown to be a dry and indehiscent nutlet of an obovate shape and bilaterally symmetrical cross-section. The thin testa of the seed is immediately inside the thickened fruit wall. The embryo is strongly curved and encircles the relatively scanty perisperm.
10.2307/1220936|Dr. David Griffiths studied Opuntia from 1905 until 1916. The glass negatives of his collections are housed at the Smithsonian Institution and have recently been catalogued. Two lists are given here, one by species and one by negative number. Additional information is available on request.
10.2307/1220937|Research at Kew and the British Museum has turned up the type and other authentic material of Crataegus flava Aiton. The discovery that this is a quite different species from that commonly called C. flava in the North American literature, indeed that it cannot belong to the same series, necessitates a new name for series Flavae, auctt. Amm. This new serial name is Lacrimatae Phipps based on C. lacrimata Small. Whether C. flava Aiton should be reassigned to the series Pulcherrimae (Beadle ex Sarg.) Robertson or to Intricatae (Sarg. ex Sarg.) Rehd. awaits the revision of these series.
10.2307/1220938|Many morphological features of the heads of Compositae are systematically useful. Receptacular bracts (pales or paleae) are of particular significance taxonomically. These structures occur in nine of the 13 recognized tribes (absent in Arctoteae, Calenduleae, Senecioneae and Tageteae), with the greatest concentration in the Anthemideae, Heliantheae, and Inuleae. Because the Heliantheae contain the broadest diversity of pale types, the adaptive significance of these features within this tribe deserves special emphasis. Certain subtribes of the Heliantheae are characterized by distinctive types of pales, such as flattened with orange-brown lines in the Coreopsidinae, pales subtending only the outer series of disc florets in the Madiinae, or their complete absence in the Bahiinae. Of the five principal factors affecting the evolution of features of heads in the family, viz., protection, dispersal, pollination, breeding systems, and seed germination, the former two are most likely the most important selective forces in the evolution of pales. Dispersal functions of pales include attachment or close envelopment of the achene by the pales with removal of the entire unit by wind from the head, conduplicate pales serving as chutes for release of unattached achenes, and brightly colored, fleshy pales being attractive to animals. Protective functions occur against predators and environmental extremes, and occur in bud, anthesis, and mature fruiting stages. Pales function during anthesis to protect ovaries and achenes from apical and lateral insect attack. The particular variations of the pales depend on the associated structures of the heads and breeding systems. In a phylogenetic context, the large and sometimes foliose pales of the Heliantheae seem best interpreted as adaptations for protection of large achenes and not necessarily as reflections of a primitive condition within the family.
10.2307/1220939|Carex acaulis (Cyperaceae) occurs in Patagonia and as a disjunct on East Falkland Island. Examination of the holotype reveals that some specimens previously reported as "C. acaulis" are actually referable to other taxa (e.g., C. macrosolen and C. barrosii); importantly, some specimens previously reported as "C. fuscula" are also assignable to C. barrosii. Consequently: (1) this is the first report of C. barrosii from Tierra del Fuego and the Falkland Islands; (2) C. macrosolen is more widespread and frequently occurring in the Fuegian archipelago than previously reported; and (3) further verification is needed before C. acaulis should be included as a member of the Fuegian flora.
10.2307/1220945|Two important problems hamper progress towards an unambiguous classification of cultivated plants. The first problem arises from the incompatibility between the "International Code of Botanical Nomenclature" (ICBN) and the "International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants" (ICNCP). The ICBN is restricted to nomenclature, the ICNCP treats nomenclature, classification and registration. Each code has different rules for the naming of hybrids causing ambiguity in the naming of cultivated hybrid plants. The second problem is the insufficient way in which the ICNCP defines the cultivar group, its relation to botanical classification and its nomenclature. This article presents these problems in a general way with the intention to stimulate further discussion, thereby helping to bring into line both Codes with respect to the classification of cultivated plants.
10.2307/1220950|Lectotypes are designated for Bromus pinnatus L. and Festuca phoenicoides L. and a neotype is chosen for Bromus distachyos L.
10.2307/1220951|In this paper a lectotype for Salix alba L. is designated from the Burser herbarium (UPS).
10.2307/1220952|Atragene alpina L. is typified by the specimen in Herb. Burser XVII: 39 (UPS) and A. sibirica L. by 711.7 (LINN). The latter is shown to be a nomen ambiguum. However, current usage for both names in Clematis is maintained, the correct names in Clematis being C. alpina (L.) Miller and C. sibirica Miller, respectively. In Atragene the correct names for these two species are A. alpina L. and A. speciosa Weinmann.
10.2307/1220953|The identity and nomenclature of the nine species of Vitaceae in Rheede's "Hortus Malabaricus" are discussed, and their types and distribution are also indicated.
10.2307/1220954| The delimitation of the species Daucus carota L. is confused by the occurrence of crop-weed complexes. As a result of a study of the Linnaean protologue and the elements on which it is based, specimen 340.1 (LINN) is designated as lectotype for Daucus carota L. Vouchers and the status of the unnamed varieties  and  are discussed. 
10.2307/1220955|Recent publications have proposed new names in the alliance of species including the sweet potato, Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lamarck. Examination of these publications and certain types has led to a need for further changes.
10.2307/1220956| Salvia tingitana fu descrita por Etlinger (1777: 35), sealando en el protlogo: "Habitat in Africa". Sin embargo, si bien esta especie ha sido reconocida por diversos autores, nnca ha sido recolectada en forma silvestre y las escasas citas existentes, provienen todas ellas de cultivos en jardines o en agricultura. Constituye por ello, esta planta, un taxon problemtico.

10.2307/1222136|The phenolic content of leaves from 138 individuals of Dactylis glomerata L. has been chromatographed and numerically analyzed. This sampling took into account the 14 diploid subspecific units of the D. glomerata specific complex. The phytochemical results allowed us to elucidate the degrees of variation at different taxonomic levels and suggested some physiological and ecological bases supporting an organization into five closely related groups.
10.2307/1222137|The assertion that ontogeny and phylogeny are closely related phenomena seems to be valid, but the nature of this relationship has not been explored in sufficient depth. The present study details some quantitative methods through which the nature of speciation and development can be simultaneously addressed. Within-species variation was assessed for species of the related genera Wyethia, Balsamorhiza, and Helianthella (Asteraceae, Heliantheae) for three data sets consisting of shoot, terminal head, and cauline leaf variables. Although the changes in organization that occur through development could not be directly measured here, variation among mature plants permits inferences to be made regarding the product of ontogeny. Within-species variation appears to be unique and unpredictable, even among species that are sympatric or share membership in small monophyletic groups. Such unique and unpredictable variation can be interpreted as changes in organization that occur as the partial manifestation of phylogenesis. Studies on other plants indicate similar changes in variation occur during ontogeny. These results imply that studies concerned with changing organization will provide clarification of the relationship between development and speciation. A necessary prerequisite to a systematic study is an understanding of the development and integration of characters used in the study. A discussion of explanations claiming to address biological change and their applicability to these results is provided. Neo-Darwinian theory appears incapable of providing an adequate explanation of the results presented here, as changing organization and increasing complexity would not be predicted from it. On the other hand, Brooks and Wiley's theory of evolution, based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics, does predict an irreversible increase in complexity in biological systems as they change with time. Explication of the relationships between ontogeny and phylogeny may be forthcoming from studies stressing the description of ontogenetic variation among individuals set within an independently derived phylogenetic framework.
10.2307/1222138|It has been shown that eight well-defined species of Antennaria should be recognized (A. aromatica, A. corymbosa, A. marginata, A. media, A. microphylla, A. racemosa, A. rosulata, and A. umbrinella). A proposed synonymy for these eight diploid species, based on the similarity matrix and discriminant analysis, is presented here. These species appear to be the sexual progenitors for the polyploid agamic complexes comprising A. rosea and A. parvifolia. Relationships between the diploids and the polyploids are discussed.
10.2307/1222139|The Swedish botanist Harry Smith travelled in China in the 1920's and 1930's. This paper presents a brief description of his routes, including a list of collection sites with locations determined using geographical coordinates.
10.2307/1222140| Accumulation of nickel to levels exceeding 1000 g/g of dry matter, already found in many species of Thlaspi L. from Europe and western U.S.A., is also characteristic of seven species of this genus growing on ultramafic soils in Cyprus, Turkey, northern Syria and Japan. Two Turkish serpentineendemic species of Cochlearia behave in the same way, but many other members of the Brassicaceae from nickel-rich soils show only slightly elevated nickel levels. Zinc accumulation is known to occur in some European Thlaspi species, in Cochlearia pyrenaica and in Arabidopsis thaliana on zinc-rich soils. Some Thlaspi species, however, accumulate high levels of zinc even when they are not associated with known zinc mineralisation. Abnormal metal uptake by many species of Thlaspi and Cochlearia is a property of fundamental importance in considerations of the taxonomy and distribution in these genera. 
10.2307/1222141|A colorless euglenoid was isolated from a sample of seawater collected from a New Jersey salt marsh in March 1984. This organism has been continuously maintained in the laboratory for the past three years. Though evidently belonging to a different species, this euglenoid bore remarkable similarities to Serpenomonas costata, previously described from the same sample. In ultrastructural features such as pellicle, flagellar apparatus, and feeding apparatus the organisms are nearly identical and there is little doubt that the two species belong to the same genus. Subsequent investigation revealed that the second species is Ploeotia vitrea Dujardin (1841), despite the fact that a feeding apparatus was neither mentioned nor illustrated by Dujardin. It has therefore become necessary to transfer S. costata to Ploeotia as a new combination, and to redescribe that genus to account for features that were not observed when the original description was made.
10.2307/1222142|Historically, the phylogenetic affinities of the Ceratophyllaceae have been vague, however, recent authors have favored a close relationship of the family to the genus Cabomba of the Nymphaeales. An evaluation of critical character distributions by cluster analyses confirmed relationships of Cabomba with Brasenia, Euryale with Victoria, and Nymphaea with Nuphar, Ondinea, and Barclaya, but did not support a close affinity of Ceratophyllum to any nymphaealean genus. By phenetic analyses, Ceratophyllum is distinct and not recognizable as a natural component of the Nymphaeales. This conclusion is in line with revised interpretations of available data from various sources, which point to an isolated position of the Ceratophyllaceae. Paleobotanical evidence supports a hypothesis that the Ceratophyllaceae are a vestige of ancient angiosperms that diverged early from the line leading to most other modern taxa. The remoteness of Ceratophyllaceae from the Nymphaeales and other extant angiosperms warrants the recognition of a new, distinct order of flowering plants.
10.2307/1222143|The small genus Tetrameranthus (five species) stands isolated within the Annonaceae. A cladistic analysis was carried out using macromorphological characters in order to find possible apomorphies and to attempt a phylogenetic reconstruction. In the "best" cladograms there appear two subsets, one formed by T. duckei, T. macrocarpus, and T. pachycarpus, the other by T. laomae and T. umbellatus. Both are supported by a number of apomorphic character states. Any other conclusions remain speculative.
10.2307/1222144|Hemolysis is a traditional test for the presence of certain saponins in plant tissues. The hemolytic capacities of Medicago and allied genera were examined. It was found that leaves of Medicago species are hemolytic, although there are considerable differences in strength of reaction among species and populations of species. The leaves of species of six related genera consistently proved not to be hemolytic. Thus hemolysis by leaves is a synapomorphic discriminator, and supports a recent, controversial expanded circumscription of Medicago. The hemolytic capacities of seeds of Medicago and its closest allies, Trigonella and Melilotus, were also examined. Only about a third of Medicago species had hemolytic seeds, and the distribution of these is more or less characteristic of certain infrageneric groups. Three interrelated species of Trigonella proved to be the only species of genera other than those of Medicago with hemolytic seeds. In Medicago, hemolysis is caused by glycosides of the saponin medicagenic acid; different but as yet unidentified hemolytic agents are present in the seeds of the three hemolytic species of Trigonella.
10.2307/1222145|Pairs of angiosperm species putatively separated by continental drift following the break-up of Gondwanaland have been used to derive linear regressions relating macromolecular differences to time. Differences have been derived from N-terminal amino acid sequences of the small subunit of rubisco from members of Proteaceae, Winteraceae, Nothofagus and Solanum. Alternative sets of times have been taken from the literature on plate tectonics and biogeography. Botanical criteria have been used to discriminate tentatively between the two regression lines. The rate of evolution corresponding to the preferred regression is one inferred nucleotide difference between two evolutionary lineages in seven million years. An estimate of the variance about the regression lines has been obtained and has allowed suggestions about which species disjunctions are likely to have originated more recently than the continental separations.
10.2307/1222146|The history of the British Antarctic Survey Herbarium (AAS) is outlined briefly, and the origins of the new Antarctic Plant Database are explained. Details of the structure, coverage and potential uses of the database are given for prospective users.
10.2307/1222147|The systematic position of Ophioglossaceae was examined using available evidence from recent anatomical and morphological studies. Although the Ophioglossaceae are free-sporing vascular plants like the Filicopsida, and are therefore commonly placed in that group, the character correlation of eustelic or sympodial primary vascular system of stem, the presence of vascular cambium, periderm, circular bordered-pitted tracheids, the anatomy of axillary branching, solitary sporangia, and also non-circinate vernation indicate a relationship of the family with the progymnosperm-seed plant line. It is suggested that the Ophioglossaceae are living progymnosperms and, among extant seed plants, the family is most closely related to Cycadopsida, both having large, fernlike leaves. It is pointed out that the Ophioglossaceae resemble glossopterid gymnosperms in the three-dimensional structure of their leaves with epiphyllous sporophores.
10.2307/1222175|Ten drawings from the collection were studied. Nine evidently pertain to the Rhamnaceae, and one to the Celtidaceae. All are assigned confidently to genus, and six to species, but four remain doubtful as to species. No nomenclatural novelty is required.
10.2307/1221096|Historical geological and historical floristic/vegetational data show an extraordinary dynamic world. Moving plates, the upheaval of mountain chains, and changes of climate and vegetation are the main elements of this dynamism. They are partly endogene, resulting from forces inside the earth, and partly exogene, resulting from direct or indirect changes of solar radiation received by the earth. The evolution and differentiation of the tropical floras and the migration of floristic elements is heavily influenced by these factors. The glacial-interglacial climatic cycles of the last few million years had an especially profound effect on the biosphere, including the tropics. There were profound changes in vegetation, not only displacement of zones or belts, but also reordering of species, and the formation and disappearance of refugia in lowlands and mountains.
10.2307/1221097| An analysis is made of the growth rate of tropical herbaria and only a few areas, Central America, Pacifica and the West Indies appear to have adequate collecting rates. In spite of recent calls for accelerated collecting in the tropics, the overall rates have not increased greatly even though the threat of destruction of natural habitats and species loss is an increasingly serious problem. Some key areas in greatest need of tropical floristic inventory in the near future are suggested. In the Neotropics, Atlantic coastal Brazil, the Colombian, Choc, Bolivia, Rondnia and Acre in Brazil, and Guyana stand out as in need of further inventory. The collections of Chrysobalanaceae between 1972 and 1986 are analyzed and although many new species have been found, a large amount of material of common species has been repeatedly re-collected, collections of both Chrysobalanaceae and the Projeto Flora Amazonica program are still yielding at least one new species per every 100 numbers collected, indicating continued inadequate inventory of the Neotropics. Tropical flora programs are discussed and it is suggested that there is a need for many more florulas of carefully selected small areas of the tropics. An analysis of the productivity of Flora Neotropica shows that in order to provide an adequate monographic basis for local floras there is an urgent need to increase the rate of production of monographs of tropical groups. This survey indicated that the work force in systematic botany is far too small for the urgent tasks that face it over the next few years. 
10.2307/1221098|Of the roughly 265,000 species of plants in the world, about a third occur in temperate regions, a third in Latin America, and a third in the tropics and subtropics of Africa and Asia. Tropical forests are being destroyed very rapidly, as a result of the explosive growth of a record human population, extensive poverty, and an unwillingness to learn about and practice sustainable land use in the tropics. As a consequence, at least a fifth of the total plant species in the world, something on the order of 60,000 species, are threatened with extinction over the next several decades. Systematic botanists need urgently to devise comprehensive plans to inventory plant diversity, especially in the tropics. They should play a major role in making possible the utilization of this diversity for human benefit, and in conserving as extensive a sample as possible.
10.2307/1221099|An overview of botanical exploration as related to plant distribution patterns in Colombia is presented. Reference is made to current efforts to study the natural vegetation, and the need for intensive work in many areas of the country is emphasized.
10.2307/1221100|Ecuador covers some 300,000 km<sup>2</sup> on the west coast of the South American continent. The country is divided into three natural regions: the coastal plain, the Andes cordillera, and the eastern lowlands. Twenty-six life zones, including deserts, rainforests, and high montane vegetation types, are represented in the country. The flora includes an estimated 20,000 species of vascular plants. In this study the distribution of a sample of 536 species is analyzed, and some conspicuous phytogeographic patterns are obvious. The lowland flora is rich in widespread species and many of them occur on both sides of the Andes. The coastal plain is rich and the eastern lowlands are poor in endemics. The mid-elevations between 900 m and 3000 m house about half of the species of the country although they constitute only 10% of the area. Endemism is high at mid-elevations: 39% of the mid-elevation species do not reach beyond Ecuador. Especially the western slopes of the Andes are rich in endemics with 10% of the total Ecuadorean flora being restricted to them. The Ecuadorean highlands above 3000 m house 10% of the total flora of the country. Endemism in the highlands is about the same as at mid-elevations.
10.2307/1221101| In a brief introduction to the Guianan area (location, geomorphology and climate), the author gives a short description of the main forest types occurring in the Guianas: upland moist forest, montane and lower montane forest, inundated forests, transition forests, and forests on white sand soils. Then, the distribution patterns of selected plant groups represented in the Guianan lowland forest region (Meliaceae, Caryocaraceae, Tabernaemontanoideae, Musaceae, Zingiberaceae, Arecaceae, Passifloraceae, Lindsaea, Ochnaceae) are analyzed. The endemism and floristic affinities of the Guianan forests are briefly discussed in relation to the theory of the South American forest refugia. /// [French] Aprs une prsentation de la rgion des Guyanes (situation, gomorphologie et climat), l'auteur donne une brve description de chacun des types de fort existant dans les Guyanes: fort humide tropicale sempervirente de l'intrieur, fort de montagne et de basse montagne, forts inondes, forts de transition et forts sur sables blancs.

10.2307/1221102| During the last 40 years, an impressive amount of biological, especially botanical, information concerning the Venezuelan Guayana region has been accumulated. Both the lowlands, as well as the distinctive highland mountains ('tepuis'), evidence an outstandingly rich and diversified flora and vegetation. It has been postulated that this biological richness and the high degree of endemism are the result of long-term and highly effective isolation suffered by the flat summit areas during extremely long geologic epochs. This static view is being challenged presently by the results of recent intensive fieldwork made in the Venezuelan Guayana. A detailed analysis of two highly evolved Guayana taxa, Stegolepis (Rapateaceae) and Bonnetia (Theaceae s.l.) shows a rather uniform distribution not only in summit habitats, but also in intermediate and lowland habitats. As a whole, both genera and several related taxa prove to have occupied successfully not only the ancient summit regions of the tepuis, but also the surrounding lowlands of much more recent geomorphological origin. Palaeoecological research also supports the hypothesis that the entire Guayana Shield area has been affected by climatic oscillations during the recent past as have the nearby Andes. This implies significant past fluctuations of the altitudinal vegetation belts in the tepui area and could well explain the wide altitudinal gradient of most of the Guayana Highland taxa. Also, the presence of convergent 'paramoid' vegetation types on the summits of the Chimant Massif, indicates active speciation not only at the systematic level, but especially at the ecologic level. Thus, it is proposed that the Guayana highland and lowland biota have been and still are dynamically and genetically interdependent, not only within the Guayana region itself, but also with the adjacent complex of lowland and mountain biota. 
10.2307/1221103|A distribution pattern analysis of 377 Cuban liverworts and 386 mosses shows a relatively high rate of endemism (11.4% and 12.2%, respectively), which is comparable to the rate of endemism in Cuban ferns but much lower than phanerogamic endemism (51.4%). In the Cuban bryoflora neotropical and Caribbean elements as well as Antillean subendemics prevail. The species/genus ratio (4:1 for the liverworts and 2:7 for the mosses), and the relatively high insularity index (3:1 for liverworts and 5:0 for mosses) are indicative of long-term isolation of the Cuban bryophyte flora and the large size of the island.
10.2307/1221104|The case is made that ecological characteristics can provide valuable evidence for species delimitation in complex floras such as those of tropical rain forests. Differences between sympatric populations of morphologically similar entities in such aspects as edaphic range, reproductive phenology, pollination biology, combined with evidence for outbreeding, and for interspecific hybridization in nature assist in evaluating whether such entities behave as biological species. Current evidence on the biological nature of rain forest tree species is discussed.
10.2307/1221105|Virtually all flower-visiting insect groups had already existed at the time of early angiosperm differentiation; beetles, flies, thrips, and moths were available as potential pollinators. Unspecific interactions with these insect groups are found in the Winteraceae, archaic Magnoliidae. Winteraceae are often weedy species for which an open pollination system may be advantageous in view of the different insect faunas of newly invaded habitats. Winteraceous pollination modes and life strategies are here interpreted as close to the ancestral condition of the angiosperms. The Annonaceae provide examples of more economic and effective plant/pollinator interactions. Within this family a range exists of different adaptations for pollination by beetles. Flowers in several genera provide pollination chambers resulting from enfolding petals in which beetles stay for long periods of time. In the dark chambers the beetles are protected against environmental changes and predators. The permanently recurved microsporophylls of the flowers of the late bennettitalean genus Cycadeoidea, evolving during the early Cretaceous, may be a comparable adaptation to beetle pollination.
10.2307/1221106| A review of the recent numerous LM, SEM and TEM studies of the pollen of Annonaceae shows a large variation in the apertural region especially in the different layers on the sporoderm (exine and intine). It emphasizes the difficulty in defining some pollen types, like inaperturate or omniaperturate and the complexity of pollen evolution. /// [French] La complexit de la structure sporodermique (exine et intine) de la rgion aperturale et de son volution dans le pollen des Annonaces est examine  partir des nombreuses tudes ralises ces dernires annes en microscopie optique et lectronique. Elle souligne en particulier la difficult de dfinir certains types polliniques tels que les inaperturs ou omniaperturs. 
10.2307/1221107|The inflorescences of Magnoliales exhibit a wide range of diverse forms. Monotelic inflorescences prevail by far. Panicles or thyrses terminating the flowering shoots are relatively rare, mostly the main axis shows a proliferating growth, then bearing "axillary" inflorescences only. By reduction of the ramification of the flower bearing axis, botryoids or even further reduced inflorescences can be formed. Solitary flowers terminating leafy shoots are also found in several families of the Magnoliales (as well as in Dilleniales). Highly specialized long shoot--short shoot systems are not rare (Calycanthaceae, Schisandraceae, Winteraceae, Eupteleaceae, Tetracentraceae, Cercidiphyllaceae, Eucommiaceae, Myristicaceae), and even cauliflory occurs. Progression to an inflorescence of the polytelic type is relatively rare and occurs especially in some genera of the Lauraceae and apparently generally in Hernandiaceae and probably in members of Myristicaceae.
10.2307/1221108|After a review of a number of characters of the Winteraceae, two topics are discussed. Firstly, it is argued that determination factors of place, size, form, and function of petals and stamens can become unlocked and fixed again in a different way, giving rise to a new form: the stamen with a petaloid appendage, which consequently has to be considered as derived. Secondly, the differences between the Old World section Tasmannia and the New World section Drimys of the genus Drimys are discussed on the basis of two alternative clado-eventograms. It is suggested that the low chromosome number of section Tasmannia is an apomorphy and that Drimys in its wide sense should be upheld.
10.2307/1221109|Two hundred sixty-three species of the Magnoliidae distributed over the main genera of all its families were investigated with the TEM for ultrastructural characters from their sieve elements. Details from sieve-element plastids (overall diameter, as well as qualitative and quantitative measurements of their starch and protein contents) provided the main data set for a putative phylogenetic arrangement of the families of Magnoliiflorae. The recording of the presence or absence of nondispersive protein bodies and nacreous wall thickenings yielded additional information. Within the Magnoliiflorae sieve-element plastids are proposed to have evolved from large-sized S-type plastids with high amount of starch to small-sized, starch-deficient P-type or, at the other extreme, to So-plastids. Along this line a basic group containing Austrobaileyaceae, Illiciaceae, Schisandraceae, Chloranthaceae, Myristicaceae, and Winteraceae is distinguished from four parallel and slightly advanced groups, the Annona-, Aristolochia-, Magnolia-, and Monimia-groups. The Aristolochia-group is held to represent one of the core groups of the Magnoliiflorae, incorporating the whole range of the different plastid forms from S-type to So-plastids or by several steps to form-Pc and the monocotyledon form-P2c plastids. Among the remaining five the Monimia-group, only, shows a comparably broad range, while all other taxa are confined to one or two plastid forms (i.e., S-type and/or form-Psc resp. -Pcs plastids).
10.2307/1221110|The extent to which it is possible to apply the use of databases to a flora project at the present time is illustrated by means of an example of the genus Rubus (Rosaceae) for Flora Mesoamericana. Databases are included for the nomenclature, bibliography, herbarium label data and the morphological descriptions. These data are used and analysed in a great many different ways, all of which are immediately practical on a desktop microcomputer.
10.2307/1221111|An interactive computer program is described for the construction and revision of diagnostic identification keys. As far as possible, all the mechanical aspects of writing and organising the key are left to the computer, while the user contributes subjective taxonomic skills. The program can also provide advice to the user on how best to proceed. It represents a synthesis between older more or less automatic algorithms for key construction and interactive identification (expert) programs which do not involve keys.
10.2307/1221112|Taxonomists publish information about biological organisms that is of great value to the scientific community. Unfortunately conventional texts have two shortcomings: they are commonly indexed only by scientific name and taxonomic position of the organisms described, and soon become outdated. Such indices are of little use to applied biologists whose primary interest is in accessing the descriptive information in the body of the text. Access to this information would be improved if it were stored in databases with multiple indices and which in turn could be used to publish more diverse up to date information products. Free-text databases offer few advantages over conventional texts stored on word processor while structured database design ensures greater consistency, permits automatic checks of data integrity, and provides for flexible indexing and reliable retrieval. The design and construction of structured taxonomic databases is challenging and labour intensive. Use of such databases, however, requires limited intellectual effort or expertise and may be used effectively by the casual user. If descriptions are to be used for more than one purpose then multiple characters may be needed to define single features of organisms. Such "sister characters" differ in their information content or the phraseology of definition. Only structured databases permit users with differing needs to obtain alternative views of a single stored description. The technology now exists to incorporate visual information within taxonomic databases but visual data are subject to the same structural constraints as descriptive text. An understanding of these constraints is necessary for effective database construction and furthers our understanding of taxonomic data and taxonomic practice.
10.2307/1221113|After 15 years of experience with Flora of Veracruz project it seems important to make an evaluation of its challenges and accomplishments. This is important because we believe it is the oldest on-going project using computers; is the oldest floristic project initiated, directed, and financed mostly by a tropical developing country; and because it has been a success in spite of being unfinished. We have always considered the Flora of Veracruz to be an experimental flora, a place to try new ideas and techniques. Through this approach we hoped that an information and technological transfer could be possible to established or beginning floristic programs.
10.2307/1221114|Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) made his first acquaintance with a tropical flora about 1744 when studying a large collection of herbarium specimens and drawings made in Sri Lanka (Ceylon) by Paul Hermann, and on these he based his "Flora Zeylanica" (1747). Otherwise, down to the publication of the Species plantarum (1753), his knowledge of tropical plants was based on a limited number in cultivation and on a large number of illustrations in the works of Kaempfer, van Rheede, J. and C. Commelin, Merian, Plumier, Petiver, Sloane, and Rumpfis, but relatively little on herbarium material. These works provide iconotypes for many 1753 Linnaean binomials. In 1758 Linnaeus bought Patrick Browne's Jamaican herbarium. He also received specimens from former students visiting tropical countries. Long before then European trading activities had dispersed some ruderal plants from port to port, making them almost pantropical. Collections often contained specimens of these. Hence Linnaeus tended to regard the tropical floras as rather uniform over the world instead of regionally very diverse. Nevertheless he devised a methodology and a nomenclature fundamental for the later development of tropical botany.
10.2307/1221115|The nature and requisites of biological bibliography are reviewed. Biographical notes on five bibliographers--Jonas Dryander, G. A. Pritzel, Joseph Sabin, Alfred Rehder, and Claus Nissen--are presented. Their different backgrounds, methods, and results as related to their potential usefulness for the investigator are considered. The value of consulting bibliographies outside the field of botany, particularly zoology and travel works, is suggested for many botanical problems.
10.2307/1221116|An account of the pre- 1950 attempts to set up an international organization to deal with "urgent taxonomic needs" such as the coordination of the work on botanical nomenclature, the provision of guides to herbaria, collections and literature, the organization of international meetings, and the publication of a journal as the main tool to achieve these goals. The history of IAPT, founded 1950, is briefly treated, highlighting the role of the journal "Taxon" and the publication of the "Index herbariorum," the "Index nominum genericorum," and "Taxonomic literature" in realizing the pre- 1950 as well as several of the current needs of plant taxonomy with an emphasis on the importance of maintaining the IAPT and its Bureau for the implementation of these projects.
10.2307/1222087|The discovery of new fossil plant remains, together with new interpretations of previously described forms, suggests that some ideas regarding the origin of land plants need to be modified. Some evidence suggests that perhaps plants with a bryophytic level of organization were on the land as early as the Ordovician. This suggestion is strengthened by a number of Devonian plants that lack tracheids despite possessing a suite of morphological features generally attributed to vascular plants. Such information necessitates that the current classification of early land plants be re-examined, together with ideas about the origin and subsequent evolution of vascular plants and bryophytes.
10.2307/1222088|A recent classification of the Monimiaceae is considered. Several overlooked aspects of some South American species are pointed out. A 'new' genus and a 'new' combination are shown to have been already published.
10.2307/1222089|Bryophyte systematists have long believed that because both the gametophytic and sporophytic generations are well developed and diverse, the classification of mosses presents difficulties not found in other plants. Often classifications based on the sporophyte are quite different from those based on the gametophyte. Following methods developed by Rohlf, the product--moment correlation between two matrices of similarity values was used as a numerical measure of congruence, and a randomization test was applied to assess its significance. The degree of incongruence between phenetic similarity matrices based independently on gametophytic and sporophytic characters was measured for three published data sets. The similarity matrix correlation coefficients range from 0.07 to 0.21, all indicating a high degree of incongruence. This incongruence is as great as or greater than that reported for classifications based on different life stages or body parts in other groups of plants and animals. For two of the three data sets studied, classifications based independently on gametophytic and sporophytic characters are significantly less congruent than classifications based on randomized subsets of the characters. The differences in phenetic relationships as expressed by the gametophytic and sporophytic generations thus appear to be real rather than being simply an artifact of splitting a homogeneous set of characters into two subsets.
10.2307/1222090|A list of the taxa of Araceae in W. H. Schott's herbarium in Vienna which were lost at the end of World War II is given.
10.2307/1222091|This account concerning the distribution of living or dried collections of Araceae should provide the reader with facts about where the better collections of Araceae are deposited. This information is important, because of the low rate of duplication of aroid collections, and the generally low rate of collection and poor preservation of specimens, resulting generally in few, relatively poorly preserved collections of any given species. This generally translates into need to borrow on a much broader basis for revisionary studies of Araceae. This survey should provide additional details about the locations of Araceae collections which are most likely to yield material of interest to the monographer or to the writers of floristic accounts.
10.2307/1222092|China is a large country, vast in territory and rich in natural resources. But the country has been isolated from the international botanical community for the past several decades. Since Liberation in 1949 the number of herbaria in China has increased by more than 500%. At the same time an extensive program to inventory the nation's botanical wealth and produce a flora for all of China has been undertaken. This paper attempts to summarize the history of herbaria in China and to make known their current status so that the rich resources they contain may become better known to the world's botanists.
10.2307/1222093|A software package called DIDEA-FR was written using dBase III/dBase III Plus. DIDEA-FR includes 36 interconnected program files and is subdivided into two ranges (subdirectories), one for the management of plant data (including seedlists) comprising 11 subranges, the other for the management of address data comprising five subranges. All subranges (input, search for and change of data, print out of various list types, of the seedlist (Index Seminum) and of seed and address labels) work in dialogue mode and automatically. DIDEA-FR can be managed by a trained part time user.
10.2307/1222094|The diagnostics, ecology, damage caused and controls for the chief pests in herbaria are described. The effectiveness and safety of available pest controls are reviewed. It is shown that a number of chemical controls are less effective than widely believed while the hazards to health and herbarium materials posed by some may often be overlooked. Neither of the currently used specimen poisons, mercuric chloride and lauryl pentachlorphenate are satisfactory. It is shown that pest controllers should integrate chemical methods with safe and effective physical measures. These include having barriers to the entry of flying insects; treating incoming specimens with freezing, microwaves or aerosol insecticides; monitoring pest arrivals using baited traps; restricting breeding by having low relative humidity, dustless floors and sealed steel cabinets containing a fumigant; and periodic eradication by fumigation with methyl bromide.
10.2307/1222095|The presence of abietane derived diterpenoids in a few members of the large American Salvia subgenus Calosphace suggests that it may have differentiated from groups ancestral to the Old World salvias or even prior to the differentiation of the groups in Salvia.
10.2307/1222117|Myriophyllum sibiricum Komarov is lectotypified on Komarov 4855, from the Kamchatka River basin (LE!). The later name M. exalbescens Fernald falls into synonymy under M. sibiricum.

10.2307/1222126|Proposal 725 to reject the name Aristolochia longa L. under the Article 69 of the ICBN is stressed against any easier solution which aims at putting it into oblivion. The lectotype of the name, designated when the proposal was advanced, is also confirmed, and additional data are supplied on this subject.
10.2307/1222127|The name Sonneratia caseolaris came into usage nearly a century ago when full species priority came into effect. The basionym, Rhizophora caseolaris, is based on two Rumphian elements, Mangium caseolare album and M. caseolare rubrum. The former belongs to a major E African--Pacific taxon known as Sonneratia alba and the latter to a major Pakistan--Pacific taxon long known as S. acida but as S. caseolaris for the last century. The proposal aims to lock the typification of R. caseolaris to the rubrum element and avoid the shift to the album element, as would be necessary by the acceptance of the apparent earliest typification by Gaertner.
10.2307/1220881|The origin of the seed-plant life history, and subsequent diversification of seed morphology, should be considered two independent, fundamentally distinct evolutionary problems. Gametophytic endospory may have arisen paedomorphically from homosporous ancestors, specifically by progenesis in the gametophyte generation. Heterospory and gametophytic unisexuality are not necessarily evolutionary antecedents of endospory; rather, they may have arisen as developmental consequences of endospory. Once seeds existed, their early pattern of diversification was not one of gradual change in form, but of a proliferation of integumentary types differing widely from one another. Subsequently, the morphological spectrum narrowed, with closed integuments eventually prevailing. This two-stage pattern of diversity suggests an initial phenotypic breakthrough into a largely "empty" adaptive zone, followed by intensified biotic competition as the adaptive zone filled.
10.2307/1220882|The pollen of the ditypic family Hoplestigmataceae was examined in LM, SEM, and TEM, and in conjunction with floral morphology compared with the orders Boraginales, Ebenales, and Violales, to which this family has been assigned. Hoplestigma has pollen with 3-colporate apertures bordered by (six) meridional ridges that are separated by (three) intercolpar concavities. Pollen similar in SEM and TEM is found in Bourreria and Ehretia of the Boraginaceae, and is also common in the Myrtales. However, this pollen type is not known to occur in either the Violales or Ebenales; in addition the bicarpellate ovary with few ovules and sympetalous corolla of Hoplestigma are not really typical of the Violales, nor is the parietal placentation of Hoplestigma typical of the Ebenales. Although Hoplestigma shares similar pollen, numerous stamens, and many characteristics of the gynoecium with the Myrtales, it differs in having the petals united basally and unitegmic ovules versus distinct petals and bitegmic ovules in Myrtales. Until Hoplestigmataceae is examined for the presence of internal phloem, one of the more definitive characters for Myrtales, we defer to Takhtajan's placement in the Boraginales.
10.2307/1220883|The morphology of Phytolacca dodecandra, locally called endod, was examined using herbarium specimens from throughout its natural range in Africa and analyzed by principal component and principal coordinate analyses as well as contour mapping of the coordinate scores. Phytolacca dodecandra was also compared to P. dioica (introduced), P. goudotii, P. nutans, and P. octandra (introduced). Phytolacca goudotii was found to be scarcely distinct from P. dodecandra. The status of P. nutans remains questionable since only the type specimen had extremely long male flower pedicels and no other specimens have been found from throughout Africa with such long pedicels. Examination of P. dodecandra from throughout its range in Africa revealed that a few pubescent-leaved plants were found from Ethiopia. These plants include a strain (Type 44) previously selected for agronomic research. Phytolacca dodecandra was found to be very variable in its morphology, both within a region and among regions. Major regional trends discovered were differentiation of: 1) the east and west Africa populations; 2) Madagascar plants from the mainland populations; 3) the Gabon plants from other West African plants; and 4) the Uganda, Burundi, Zimbabwe, and South African plants from other regions. No evidence was found to support the recognition of varieties apiculata Engl. and brevipedicellata H. Walt.
10.2307/1220884|A computerized database is being developed for the flora of Mount Kinabalu (northern Borneo). The methodology for its development and management is described. The data can be manipulated to produce enumerations (checklists), determination lists, itineraries, specimen citations, exsiccatae lists, annotation labels, type specimen registers, distribution maps, and otherwise queried on-line at independent work stations or through a network. With minor modifications the system could be adapted for other floristic projects and for general computerization of herbarium specimens.
10.2307/1220885|Commelina caroliniana Walter is the correct name for a species that has often been confused with C. diffusa N. L. Burm. in the southeastern United States. It is lectotypified by a specimen in the Walter Herbarium. The North American plants of C. caroliniana are conspecific with plants of C. hasskarlii C. B. Clarke from India. Because C. caroliniana was published almost 100 years before Clarke's binomial, it must be taken up as the correct name for the Indian species. Commelina caroliniana was probably introduced into the United States in South Carolina with rice seed from India.
10.2307/1220886|The red alga Schizymenia dawsonii Abbott has been found to have both vegetative and reproductive features that link it closely with the widespread tropical/subtropical genus Sebdenia Berthold. The new binomial Sebdenia dawsonii (Abbott) comb. nov. is proposed.
10.2307/1220899|Boletus Dill. ex L. :Fr. presents a conserved type, Boletus edulis Bull. :Fr. Through application of Art. 7.20 it is fortunately possible to maintain Dillenius and Linnaeus in the author citation. However, for names that are not sanctioned, Art. 14.8 is currently interpreted as severing the link with the original author in case of type conservation. This practice in contradiction with Art. 47 stems from an error of the Editorial Committee of the Montreal Code. Suggestions are made to reestablish a logical wording of Art. 14.8. It is established that the typification of Suillus Micheli ex Adanson by Palm and Stewart (1984) is to be superseded and S. luteus (L. :Fr.) S. F. Gray reestablished as type of the genus. A modification of Art. 63 adopted at the Berlin congress does not make Leccinum superfluous anymore and its typification by L. aurantiacum (Bull.) S. F. Gray is accepted.
10.2307/1220901| The European species of Harpalejeunea (Spruce) Schiffn. is H. molleri (Steph.) comb. nov. (Lejeunnea molleri Steph., =H. ovata auct., (non (Dicks.) Schiffn. Douinia ovata (Dicks.) Buch). Under Art. 8, H. ovata (Dicks.) Schiffn. is superseded by H. ancistrodes (Spruce) Schiffn. as the lectotype of Harpalejeunea (Spruce) Schiffn., preserving its traditional sense and also Douinia (C. Jens.) Buch. 
10.2307/1220902|The lectotypification of Polypodium flabelliforme Poiret by C. Morton has more recently been rejected by Pichi Sermolli. The latter maintains Poiret's description to have been based solely on a Plumier plate and not at all on the specimen selected by Morton. My analyses of Poiret's description, the specimen, and the plate suggests Pichi Sermolli's position to be untenable. The original lectotypification should therefore be sustained.
10.2307/1220903|The specimen in the Linnaean Herbarium (77.2, LINN) annotated by Linnaeus as Saccharum officinarum, the scientific name long applied to sugarcane, is actually a specimen of Miscanthus floridulus (Labill.) Warb. ex Schumann & Lauterb., a related grass. To preserve the current application of Linnaeus' name, sugarcane is lectotypified on a Sloane (1707) illustration (typotype: H.S. 2:14, BM-SL) cited by Linnaeus (1753) in synonymy.
10.2307/1220905|Forty-one neotypes and one lectotype are designated for palms described from Colombia, the types of which were destroyed at B. Most neotypes come from the original type localities. Three new combinations, with basionyms in Euterpe, are made: Prestoea brachyclada, P. dasystachys and P. latisecta. Comments on synonymy are given for most species.
10.2307/1220906|The Committee for Spermatophyta has voted that the name "Phoradendron leucarpum" should not be treated as a homonym of "Phoradendron leucocarpum" thereby rendering Phoradendron serotinum (Raf.) M. C. Johnston incorrect. Although of minor economic importance, the name of the American mistletoe cannot be conserved through provisions of Art. 14.2 and Phoradendron leucarpum (Raf.) Rev. & M. C. Johnston is proposed.

10.2307/1220832|Preparatory to the use of volatile oils in systematic studies of Australian rainforest trees, the extent and systematic significance of seasonal variation in volatile oil composition were studied. Monthly samples were taken from eight trees of Lauraceae, representing six genera, over a period of 14 months; three of these trees were Litsea leefeana. It was found that the patterns of variation shown by these trees over the sampling period varied between trees, and in each case appeared to be unrelated to any seasonal trend. An analysis of the variation within the three trees of Litsea leefeana showed only seven compounds varying significantly by month of sampling, while 65 varied significantly by tree. Of the former, only one compound exceeded 0.5%. These three trees remained clearly distinct in any multivariate analysis. Monthly samples taken from a tree of Syzygium canicortex (Myrtaceae) over a period of 13 months were compared with single samples from nine other trees of this species. It was found that the variation within the one tree over the seasonal sampling period was less than the variation between trees. Thus it is concluded that seasonal variation presents no problems for sampling of Australian rainforest trees for volatile oil composition, and that samples can be taken at any time of the year.
10.2307/1220833|PRECIS (Pretoria National Herbarium Computerized Information System) is designed to provide information about plants in southern Africa, a region that lacks a completed modern flora. The system now consists of four separate but linked components: Specimen, Taxon, Nomenclatural and Curatorial. The "PRECIS experiment" covers an estimated nine per cent of the world's plant species. It provides a broad and continuously up-to-date overview of the southern African flora as well as detailed information about particular species, specimens and localities. PRECIS results have wide applicability in taxonomic and vegetation studies, and could not have been obtained without computerization.
10.2307/1220834|The herbarium at the Catholic University of America, founded as early as 1895 and later known as the Langlois Herbarium at the Catholic University (LCU), Washington, D.C., was dispersed by sale in 1985 to 1986. The institutions which received portions of the LCU herbarium included CAN, CM, DOV, F, NA, TEX, US, WIS, and the Department of Botany, Howard University, Washington, D.C. (HUDC).
10.2307/1220835|Through the help of many librarians, the author was successful in locating in European and North American libraries the Lieferung wrappers to Eugen Johann Christoph Esper's "Die Pflanzenthiere" (1788-1830) as well as to his "Fortsetzungen der Pflanzenthiere" (1794-1806). These wrappers permit the numerical and signature collation of these two important works. Because of the rarity of these Lieferung wrappers and the poor quality of the paper on which they were printed which, at present, is in various deplorable stages of deterioration, the Nachricht, the Verbesserungen, and the Druckfehler are quoted in their entirety. For each respective Lieferung the complete collation of pagination and the respective plates as issued therewith are given. The value of this information resides in the fact that the plates and their respective descriptions were not issued simultaneously; it is only through the Lieferung wrappers that the relation between the text and the plates can be determined with certainty.
10.2307/1220836|This paper reports on a method of extending species descriptions by incorporating information from the taxonomic hierarchy into a numerical classification of plant community types based on species. The basic species data are expanded to include information on higher taxonomic categories, such as genus, family, order, or class. Each stand is described by the presence, or abundance, of taxonomic categories but, unlike previous methods, only the necessary levels of the hierarchy are included. "Necessary" is here defined to be the highest level in the taxonomic hierarchy which uniquely identifies some specific taxon in the data set. If only a single member of an order is present in the data, then only taxonomic categories equal to or higher than, order are necessary to uniquely identify that taxon. Information on family, genus or species is simply redundant. Where several members of the same genus are present then all levels of the hierarchy will be recorded since they are all necessary for unique identification. Having obtained stand descriptions in terms of the taxonomic categories then classification can proceed normally using standard techniques. The method was applied to a small set of data, for which a variety of previous results was already available for comparison. The method appears to provide an effective means of extending species descriptions.
10.2307/1220837|It is emphasized that taxonomy concerns pattern and that attempts to apply temporal aspects to taxa, including species, are doomed to lead to unsolvable paradoxes. The temporal species concepts have serious impacts on biological theory as the recognition of taxa is confused with evolutionary processes. The choice of inclusiveness of any Linnean taxon is in principle arbitrary in each particular case.
10.2307/1220838|The series of five bibliographic indices for extant pollen compiled under the editorship of the late G. Thanikaimoni are analyzed with respect to instrumentation used in characterization of the angiosperm pollen wall. It is clear that scanning electron microscopy has become the most common means for examining pollen and that while the number of publications involving pollen morphology increases yearly, only a small number of genera have been studied with either scanning or transmission electron microscopes.
10.2307/1220852|It is argued that Hibiscus schizopetalus (Dyer) Hook. f. is the correct author citation and that a Kirk specimen from Mombasa is the correct lectotype for this name. Hibiscus schizopetalus, the 'fringed hibiscus' is an ornamental shrub native of E. Africa, widely and commonly cultivated throughout the tropics for its unusual and beautiful flowers. It is also used in the production of garden hybrids with H. rosa-sinensis L.
10.2307/1220855|Authorship of Henrya and its type, H. insularis, is attributed to Nees ex Benth. When Bentham is treated as the author of H. insularis, the type of this species becomes an illustration published in 1845. The commonly encountered name, Henrya scorpioides (L.) Nees, pertains to a species of Dicliptera. Its basionym, Justicia scorpioides L., is neotypified by a collection of William Houstoun in the Sloane Herbarium.
10.2307/1220856|As part of systematic studies of Clematis sect. Clematis, C. virginiana L. is lectotypified by a specimen in the Linnaean Herbarium at Uppsala.
10.2307/1220861|Three Linnaean species names now recognized in the genus Anthriscus, Scandix anthriscus, Scandix cerefolium, and Chaerophyllum sylvestre, are lectotypified on material in Linnaeus' herbarium (LINN).
10.2307/1220862|The neotypification of Ornithopus sativus Brot. (1804) by Mercedes Alsina Aser (1987) is contested. A new neotype is proposed according to Art. 8.1(b).
10.2307/1220864|A neotype is designated for Valeriana scandens L. The relationship of Linnaeus' concept of the species to that of Loefling is discussed, as are questions concerning the authorship of the binomial.
10.2307/1220865|The monospecific genus Oligandra Less. has been maintained as separate because of its heterogamous heads with female flowers outnumbering a few hermaphrodite sterile flowers. However a careful study shows Oligandra to be a synonym of Lucilia Cass. A new combination Lucilia lycopodioides (Less.) Freire is proposed, with neotype for the basionym.
10.2307/1222265|Taxonomy and systematics, which clarify organization among organisms by analysis of relationships, classification, and naming, ironically themselves require clarification of these parameters. The following are concerns: circumscription of research area; relationship with other biological sciences--whether overlapping or not, and whether hierarchical or not; subdisciplinary classification; and nomenclatural analysis of the disciplinary titles: taxonomy, systematics, biosystematics, experimental taxonomy, genecology, and population genetics. Taxonomy and systematics, and their internal subdivisions, may be conceived variously in their relationships to each other and to other sciences. All such systematizations suffer from the same problem as does biological classification: complex, overlapping, and indeed evolving relationships are distorted for the purpose of simplification. systematic disciplinary titles are problematical, including G. G. Simpson's widely employed definitions of systematics and taxonomy. Systematics and taxonomy have been interpreted as equivalent, mutually exclusive, containing each other (most desirably with taxonomy as a subfield of systematics concerned with formal classification), and overlapping. There should be encouragement for the trend of using biosystematics as a synonym of biological systematics, rather than in any of the numerous ways the word has been employed.
10.2307/1222266|Plant classifications have a frequency distribution of taxon sizes which is very skewed (the celebrated "hollow curve" of Willis). In the first part of this paper I suggest that the best general measure of the hollow curve is the variance of the fitted lognormal distribution. By this means we can compare classifications, such as Linnaean classifications with modern ones; the Linnaean classification of the Gramineae is more "lumped" but more "even" than the modern one. In the second part I use phenetic automatic classifications as a model for the classification process to show that (as Walters (1961) has predicted) classifications are heavily influenced by the method used (amount of chaining), but that the biological patterns of character state distribution among organisms also contribute to the hollowness of the curve. Although classifications are influenced by historical factors, underlying biological patterns are still evident in the relative sizes of genera. The model indicates that artificial and "real" components are present in classifications in roughly equal proportions. It seems that Clayton's (1983) phylogenetic "optimism" and Walters' (1986) psychohistorical "realism" both need modification. Monotypic taxa, in particular, may have a biological meaning. Willis interpreted monotypic genera as nascent and big genera as old. Walters interpreted monotypic genera as young historically and big genera as old historically. I suggest, from relict theory, that monotypic taxa tend to be ancient relicts and large genera tend to represent blooms of recent evolution, and that extinction, not evolution, tends to delimit taxa.
10.2307/1222267|The first comprehensive suprageneric classification of the family Hamamelidaceae since the treatment by Harms (1930) is provided. Four subfamilies are recognized: Hamamelidoideae, Rhodoleioideae, Exbucklandioideae (incl. Disanthoideae and Mytilarioideae), and Altingioideae. The Hamamelidoideae contain four tribes: Hamamelideae, Corylopsideae, Eustigmateae, and Fothergilleae (incl. Distylieae). Within the Hamamelideae three subtribes are described: Hamamelidinae subtrib. nov., Loropetalinae subtrib. nov., and Dicoryphinae subtrib. nov.
10.2307/1222268|The genera Quararibea Aublet and Matisia Humboldt & Bonpland were described 214 and 184 years ago, respectively, and have been variously combined and separated during their history. This study indicates that Quararibea differs completely from Matisia by its reduced ovarian locule number (2 to 4, versus 5 in Matisia), and, less definitively, by its short (to 4 mm), radially-symmetrical staminal lobes. In keeping with the original generic concepts, these genera are easily distinguished and should be maintained as separate. An examination of the variability of macromorphological and pollen characters suggests that Quararibea is a relatively uniform derivative of a Matisia-like ancestor. The presence or absence of a spicy odor in dried leaves is not a reliable indicator of generic identity, despite previous claims that the odor was a practical means by which to distinguish the two genera.
10.2307/1222269|An examination of type material of Iridaea punicea Postels & Ruprecht revealed that the specimens belong in Turnerella mertensiana (Postels & Ruprecht) Schmitz. Type material of Iridophycus whidbeyanum Setchell & Gardner, currently considered a synonym of Iridaea punicea, appears to be conspecific with Iridaea sanguinea (Setchell & Gardner) Hollenberg & Abbott. In the northeast Pacific there appears to be only one red, foliose species of Iridaea, I. sanguinea, distributed from Kodiak Island, Alaska (Gulf of Alaska) to south-central California (San Luis Obispo County).
10.2307/1222270|An investigation of the effect of microwave oven-drying on spores and pollen is presented. As was expected of moisture-containing bodies, microwaving does damage many spores and pollen when the plant materials containing them are so dried. However, enough grains remain intact to permit morphological study. Once dried by conventional technique, spores and pollen are no longer damaged by microwaving. A technique of intermittent bursts of microwaving during drying, in place of continuous treatment, apparently minimizes spore/pollen damage.
10.2307/1222295|The red algal generic name Hydropuntia Montagne (1842: 7), typified by H. urvillei Mont., is re-instated and circumscribed to include Polycavernosa Chang & Xia (1963: 120) and a number of its species. Up to now Hydropuntia has been regarded as a heterotypic synonym of Gracilaria Greville (1830) nom. cons. but is shown to be the earliest validly published name for those species separated from Gracilaria on the basis of both spermatangial and cystocarpic criteria.
10.2307/1222300| The name Scrophularia valentina Rouy is revived for plants of eastern Spain and the Balearic Islands, traditionally referred to S. auriculata L. The most important affinities and differences existing among this taxon and other very closely related ones, into which sometimes it had been included, are discussed. /// [French] Se recupera el nombre Scrophularia valentina Rouy para denominar al taxon iberolevantino-balear identificado tradicionalmente como S. auriculata L. Se discuten las afinidades que presenta ste con otros txones prximos, a los que en algunas ocasiones ha sido referido. 
10.2307/1222307|Celosia paniculata L. is lectotypified on a temperate element analyzed by Linnaeus and cited in the protologue of Iresine P. Browne, nom. cons. not a tropical element identifiable as I. angustifolia Euphrasen or I. diffusa Humbl. & Bonpl. ex Willd. The currently cited name in Appendix IIIA of the ICBN, "I. celosioides Nuttall", is contrary to Art. 6.4 of the Code if not Art. 64 as well.
10.2307/1222314|The traditional application of three Linnaean names can be maintained only by the conservation of types different from those designated by previous acts of lectotypification or by strict adherence of the ICBN. Accordingly, conservation is requested for Phlox ovata, Lechea minor, and Scutellaria integrifolia.
10.2307/1222315|A study of the type of Martinezia ciliata R. & P. (1798) leaves no doubt of its identity with Bactris gasipaes Kunth (in Humboldt et al., 1816). Since the latter name has been broadly used for this economically important palm, its conservation against the former, barely used name is required.
10.2307/1222628|The structure of the xylem body of nine woody species of Sedum belonging to two different groups was studied with respect to the character states of the characters correlated with the hybridization patterns of the species. No significant differences in the structure of the wood were found between the specialized and less advanced species. Like the wood of Aeonium, Kalanchoe, and Cotyledon, the features of the wood of Sedum indicate secondary woodiness or paedomorphosis. These results support the idea that the Crassulaceae descended from an herbaceous ancestor and that woodiness evolved independently in several groups.
10.2307/1222629| The names of the two Ephedra-species validly published in P. Forsskl's "Flora aegyptiaco-arabica" are typified: E. aphylla Forssk. by means of a neotype, and E. foeminea Forssk. by designation of a lectotype. Arguments and details in support of the decisions are provided. Hitherto, E. aphylla has usually been called E. alte C. Meyer. The type material of the later published E. alte is in fact a mixture of E. aphylla (male specimens) and E. foliata Boiss. ex C. Meyer (female specimens). Ephedra foeminea also has priority against E. campylopoda C. Meyer. The species and their closer relatives are compared with respect to their morphology, ecology and distribution. 
10.2307/1222630|James Bowie served Kew as a plant collector in Brazil and at the Cape of Good Hope. From an examination of the itineraries of the four journeys he undertook to the southern African interior during his initial stay at the Cape it is possible to deduce the most likely type locality (vicinity of Algoa Bay) and approximate date of collection (30 December 1821-26 February 1822) of Aloe bowiea Schult. & J. H. Schult. Detailed grid references are provided and should enable systematists to pinpoint the localities in which Bowie collected. An enumeration is given of Bowie's publications on Cape plants.
10.2307/1222631|In the late nineteenth century C. A. and P. C. Candargy made the first extensive inventory of the flora and vegetation of the island of Lesvos (Greece), and P. C. Candargy published a revision of the Hordeae (=tribus Triticeae, Poaceae). The activities of the Candargys are poorly known as are most of their publications. The present biography and bibliography provides some biographical data and clarifies their botanical writings. For each taxonomic paper the approximate date of publication is given.
10.2307/1222632|Twenty-seven treatments of plant specimens were examined to determine their effects on the quantity and quality of DNA obtained from spinach leaves. Treatments included various drying methods, cold storage, and chemical preservatives. Good yields of quality genomic DNA (30-50 kbp) were obtained from fresh, frozen, and dried leaves, but none of the chemical preservatives yielded high molecular weight DNA, even after only three to seven days of storage. The application of the hot CTAB procedure to fresh and dried leaves of Ginkgo biloba, Juniperus ashei, J. virginiana, Magnolia grandiflora, Phoradendron tomentosum, Pinus ponderosa, Quercus virginiana and Thuja orientalis, species that possess considerable tannins, yielded high molecular weight DNA from all the fresh leaves with some degradation. The dried leaves of Juniperus ashei, Quercus virginiana and Magnolia grandiflora yielded only small amounts of high molecular weight DNA with the hot CTAB extraction procedure.
10.2307/1222633| A HyperCard application for Macintosh computers is used to manage data for herbarium taxonomy. All information necessary for taxonomic revisions, including text, figures, maps, and drawings, is stored in one program package. Screen forms are designed to simulate card indices as they are commonly used by taxonomists. Output includes taxonomic reports with complete nomenclature, and literature and specimen citations. Computer generated descriptions can be added to the reports. A multi-access key allows the user to identify collections and check descriptions. Distribution maps and simple character analysis can be printed. Dictionaries containing abbreviations of periodicals and author names are included for "on-line" help. 
10.2307/1222634| Leaves of Nicotiana tabacum L. cv Samsun were selected because of the volatile nature of their active principle, nicotine. They were dried by four different methods: air-dried, oven-dried at 60C, freeze-dried, and dried in a microwave oven. The four samples of dried leaves were compared as to their microscopical characters and alkaloid content. After drying by microwaves, it remained possible to identify the leaves by their botanical characteristics. Their alkaloid content was qualitatively unchanged and quantitatively slightly superior to that of leaves dried by the other methods. 
10.2307/1222635|The following adhesives for mounting herbarium specimens, based on methyl-cellulose, are described and discussed: methyl-cellulose in alcoholic solutions for mounting labels and packets; specimen mounting-glue based on a mixture of methyl-cellulose and polyvinyl acetate; strapping with cotton tape or string impregnated with methyl-cellulose; and a liquid cellulosic substitute for cloth strapping.
10.2307/1222652|It is shown here that names validated by analytical plates unaccompanied by text should, according to the articles of the current Code, be typified by using the plates as holotypes rather than by attempting to select, as lectotypes, specimens on which the plates might be based.
10.2307/1222656|The circumstances of publication of the name Calandrinia columbiana Howell make it necessary to choose a lectotype from among Howell's specimens at ORE, in place of the previously nominated collection by David Lyall in the Gray Herbarium (GH). The taxon is currently assigned to Lewisia in the combination L. columbiana (Howell) B. L. Robinson.
10.2307/1222657|Sedum creticum Presl has been found to comprise two vicariant ecotypes which differ in growth-form. The type specimen represents the perennial, oligocarpic mountain form. The strictly monocarpic, annual or biennial lowland form was earlier described as S. creticum Boiss. & Heldr. (=S. cretense Maire). It is named here var. monocarpicum stat. et nom. nov.
10.2307/1222659|Under priority, Alkanna lutea Moris (1845) should be used instead of its later homonym, A. lutea A. DC. (1846), which is, for this reason, illegitimate. Also it is proved that A. lutea A. DC. is a heterotypic synonym of Moris' name. The type of A. lutea Moris is designated.
10.2307/1222660| The cultivated sesame is generally referred to as Sesamum indicum, especially in areas outside south and east Asia. The use of this name is based on the authority of de Candolle, who chose the epithet 'indicum' when he combined the two Linnaean species S. indicum and S. orientale in 1845. According to some recent authors, de Candolle combined the species as early as 1825. It is argued that the latter assumption is not true and that Roxburgh was the first author to combine the species as S. orientale in 1832 and that, in view of the existing use of both names in the literature, conservation of S. indicum against S. orientale is not desirable. The lectotype for S. orientale is cited. /// [French]  l'exception des rgions situes dans l'Asie mridionale et orientale, le ssame cultiv est gnralement nomm S. indicum. L'usage de ce nom est d  l'authorit de de Candolle, qui choisissait l'pithte 'indicum' quand il unissait les deux espces linnennes S. indicum et S. orientale en 1845. Selon quelques auteurs modernes, de Candolle avait uni les espces dj en 1825. Il est discut que cette acceptation n'est pas vraie et que Roxburgh tait le premier auteur qui combinait les espces comme S. orientale en 1832 et que, en vue de l'usage des deux noms dans la litrature, is n'est pas souhaitable de proposer la conservation de S. indicum contre S. orientale. Le lectotype de S. orientale est cit. 
10.2307/1222661|The combination Pluchea symphytifolia (Miller) Gillis resulted from an erroneous interpretation of the original material apparently associated with the name Conyza symphytifolia Miller. Comparison of the material regarded as the lectotype by Gillis with both Miller's original description and Houstoun's manuscript which accompanied the accession shows that Gillis' typification is incorrect. Accordingly his combination cannot apply to the taxon known formerly (and correctly) as Pluchea carolinensis (Jacquin) G. Don. Conyza symphytifolia is typified, the name falling into the synonymy of Neurolaena lobata (L.) Cassini.
10.2307/1223175|Hesperophycus harveyanus (Decaisne) Setchell & Gardner (Fucaceae, Phaeophyceae), the type and only known species of its genus, is representative of Fucus L., not of Hesperophycus as described by Setchell and Gardner. Hesperophycus is therefore proposed for conservation with Gardner 1842, on which the generic description was based, as type. The species is redescribed as H. californicus P. C. Silva. It ranges from Santa Cruz, California, to Punta Eugenia, Baja California, but is scarce on the southern California mainland. It occurs on all of the Channel Islands of southern California, but is especially abundant on Santa Catalina and Santa Cruz islands, where it forms an extensive belt in the upper intertidal zone, above Pelvetia.
10.2307/1223176|A revised computer system for generating international registries of cultivars is described. The system implements INGRES (Relational Technologies Inc.) a powerful relational database management system package. It is fully integrated from all aspects, including data input and report generation. The user may customize his own reports if desired. The system allows for the incorporation of information on gene transfer from remote taxa in cultivar generation and thus is capable of documenting various biotechnological methods in modern breeding approaches.
10.2307/1223177|A comparative survey of several historical classifications of Annonaceae down to the subtribal level is given. The role of various key characters is briefly discussed. The present paper at the same time may be considered as an introductory paper to forthcoming publications of general studies on flower and fruit characters now being conducted at Utrecht.
10.2307/1223178|Forty-three vascular plant specimens were found recently at the National Herbarium of Canada that were collected by Sir Joseph Banks on his voyage to Newfoundland and Labrador in 1766. A list of these specimens is presented together with a discussion of the relationship that they bear to collections at the British Museum (Natural History) in London as well as information contained in Banks's personal diary and plant catalogue.
10.2307/1223179| Hagstrm's concepts of relationships in Potamogeton, as reflected by the subgeneric, sectional, and subsectional divisions in his classification of the genus are investigated by reconstruction of an evolutionary "tree" deduced from phylogenetic inferences stated in his monograph. These relationships are explored in the context of results from phenetic and cladistic numerical analyses performed using characters taken from the Hagstrm monograph that are scored for 26 subsections. The Hagstrm classification represents an amalgam of phenetic and cladistic interpretations and the hierarchy does not depict accurately fundamental evolutionary relationships indicated by numerical analyses. Recommendations are provided for developing and testing evolutionary hypotheses that are independent of relationships inferred by this long-standing but problematic classification. 
10.2307/1223180|Strong correlations are demonstrated in 74 species of Eragrostis, involving microhair morphology ('chloridoid' and 'panicoid') types, PCR (photosynthetic carbon reduction) sheath anatomy, and modes of spikelet disarticulation. The observations seem significant in relation to infrageneric classification.
10.2307/1223194|Lectotype specimens are designated for the brown alga, Sargassum filipendula C. Agardh var. filipendula, and two of its varieties, S. filipendula var. laxum J. Agardh and S. filipendula var. contractum J. Agardh.
10.2307/1223195| Study of type material of Euhymenia limensis Ktzing, recently found in the National Herbarium of Victoria (MEL), has shown this alga to have vegetative and reproductive features typical of the family Halymeniaceae and most like the genus Cryptonemia. The binomial Cryptonemia limensis (Ktzing) Lewis, comb. nov. is therefore proposed. Type material of Sebdenia chichensis Taylor, Cryptonemia quaymasensis (Dawson) Dawson, C. chiangii Acleto, and C. peruviana Acleto have been examined and found to be synonymous with C. limensis. 
10.2307/1223198|Nomenclatural problems of Luzula multiflora (Ehrh.) Lej. are dealt with. The epithet was published by Ehrhart (1790) as Juncus campestris var. multiflorus, and the species rank was used by him in 1794-1795. The name is based on Linnaean material and the lectotype has been selected from the Paris collection of the Flora lapponica plants. Taxonomically, the traditional use of the name has been retained. The name Luzula pallescens Sw. is based on the same original material as L. multiflora and is shown to be illegitimate. The taxon originally called L. pallescens is described as a new species, L. pallidula. An account of older specific names in the section Luzula is given. Juncus intermedius Thuill., J. congestus Thuill., J. nemorosus Host, Luzula chabertii Rouy, etc. are typified, and L. stenophylla Steudel, L. pseudo-sudetica V. Krecz., and other names are discussed.
10.2307/1223199|Regarding two recent examples of "substitution" of authors' names in "Flora of Turkey" (Vol. 10 supplement 1988), the author discusses Art. 9.1 of the Code of Botanical Nomenclature which states that the holotype be represented by a single specimen except for herbaceous plants of "small size." He proposes that an exception be extended to all holotypes collected in a state which does not permit sure identification. In such cases, the incompletely collected sample could be completed by a second sample obtained from the first one by culture.
10.2307/1223200| The previous misidentification of the two seed samples kept as "Diplotaxis pitardiana Maire" at the Departamento de Biologa Vegetal, Escuela T. S. de Ingenieros Agrnomos, Madrid, is reported. Published data on this species obtained by a number of authors using these samples should be ascribed to Diplotaxis simplex (Viv.) Sprengel. 
10.2307/1223201|Hieracium subgenus Chionoracium Schultz-Bip. is the correct name for what has been called Hieracium subgenus Stenotheca (Monnier) Fries. All published names of subgenera, sections, subsections, and series based on species in this subgenus are listed and typified.
10.2307/1223202|A new combination, Novenia acaulis (Benth.) Freire & Hellwig, is established based on Dolichogyne acaulis Wedd. ex Benth.
10.2307/1223203|Oligandra Less. was stated by Freire (1989) to be unispecific and a synonym of Lucilia Cass. Freire formally transferred the type species, O. lycopodioides Less., to Lucilia. However, she did not account for two additional species: Oligandra pachymorpha Wedd. and O. chrysocoma Wedd. Neither belongs in Lucilia as currently interpreted (Freire, 1986).
10.2307/1223017|Recently, attention has been focused on the evolutionary role of heterochrony (phyletic change in the timing of development). Heterochrony results in the condition of paedomorphosis, the retention of juvenile features of an ancestor in adults of a descendent. Relatively few examples of evolution via heterochrony are known among flowering plants, due to the vague demarcation of juvenile and adult stages. Recent systematic studies among the endemic Hawaiian Lobelioideae (Campanulaceae) have revealed the occurrence of a significant example. The endemic genus Cyanea includes several species that produce morphologically distinct juvenile forms. The four species of the C. solanacea complex form a monophyletic lineage in which the adults of each species resemble juveniles of the next more primitive species, i.e., adults of the more derived species are progressively more juvenile in appearance. It is hypothesized that the C. solanacea complex is a paedomorphic lineage, in which successive heterochronic events have produced a sequence of progressively more paedomorphic species.
10.2307/1223018|Janice Carson Beatley, native Ohio botanist of the United States, will be remembered for her contributions toward the understanding of the wintergreen herbaceous flora of the deciduous forest region, the primeval forests of the unglaciated plateau in southeastern Ohio, and the ecological relationships of the vascular-plant flora of the Atomic Test Site in south-central Nevada. Throughout her professional life, Dr. Beatley was an outspoken advocate for ecological and environmental concerns while employed in seven different academic and research institutions and through active memberships in seven societies, whose mission is to save habitats and environments of natural areas. In her last academic appointment as a professor of biological sciences at the University of Cincinnati (1973-1987), Dr. Beatley taught courses in plant ecology and field botany and continued her research on the flora of the Nevada Test Site. In that capacity she fulfilled a long dream of returning to Ohio and teaching in the same department where Dr. E. Lucy Braun, the eminent plant ecologist, taught for 34 years and maintained her lifetime affiliation. Death came to Janice at age 68, on 14 November 1987 in Cincinnati, Ohio. As a lasting memorial in recognition of Janice C. Beatley's research in plant systematics and ecology, her brother and sister, Charles E. and Mary A. (Beatley) Jordan, presented a gift of $50,000 to the Herbarium of The Ohio State University, 16 November 1988.

10.2307/1223019|The historical circumstances that have led to the confusion of Synthyris missurica (Raf.) Pennell, reputed type of Synthyris [which is based on the first known synthyris collection (Lewis and Clark, 26 June 1806)], and Synthyris reniformis (Douglas) Benth., the first species listed by Bentham in the protologue of Synthyris, are chronicled. One hundred and forty-four years after circumscription, the type of Synthyris, S. reniformis, is correctly identified.
10.2307/1223020|A new, more advanced technique of preserving and documenting whole flower preparations from herbarium specimens utilizing a transparent supporting material is described. This technique offers two major advantages. First, the preparation leads to excellent preservation of the specimen even after many decades. Second, the preparation can be used to directly produce high quality photographs of even the most delicate of floral characters including floral vasculature.
10.2307/1223021|The need to re-examine spores of Isoetes specimens has led to serious depletion of the supply of both microspores and megaspores in many voucher specimens. Some type specimens no longer possess any spore material, seriously limiting the research value of these critical vouchers. A simple device is described that permits Isoetes samples to be handled, examined microscopically and even safely mailed without requiring repeated mining of the finite supply of spores.
10.2307/1223059|Chytroeisphaeridia grossa Smelror is a junior synonym of the characteristic early/mid Callovian (Middle Jurassic) dinoflagellate cyst Chytroeisphaeridia hyalina (Raynaud) Lentin and Williams; a full synonymy is presented.
10.2307/1223060| Cirriphyllum Grout is delimited to include C. cirrhosum (Schwaegr.) Grout, C. piliferum (Hedw.) Grout, and C. tommasinii (Boul.) Grout. Cirriphyllum tommasinii is the correct name for the taxon recently called C. tenuinerve (Lindb.) Wijk & Marg.; Rhynchostegiella tenuicaulis (Spruce) Kartt. for C. germanicum (Grebe) Loeske & Fleisch.; Eurhynchium flotowianum (Sendtn.) Kartt. for C. reichenbachianum (Hbn.) Wijk & Marg.; and Eurhynchium crassinervium (Wils.) Schimp. for C. crassinervium (Wils.) Loeske & Fleisch. These names are typified and their nomenclature and taxonomy is discussed along with Hypnum filiforme Dubois and H. lamarckii DC. 
10.2307/1223061|Cyperus ovularis (Michx.) Torr. and C. globulosus Aubl. are presently applied to common and widespread eastern North American sedges. Herein we lectotypify the names Kyllinga ovularis Michx. [basionym of Cyperus ovularis (Michx.) Torr.], Scirpus echinatus L. [basionym of Cyperus echinatus (L.) Wood], and Cyperus globulosus Aubl. We conclude that Cyperus ovularis (Michx.) Torr. is a synonym, Cyperus globulosus Aubl. has been misapplied, and propose that Cyperus echinatus (L.) Wood and Cyperus croceus Vahl be used instead.
10.2307/1223062|Sporobolus poiretii is a synonym of S. junceus, not of S. indicus, as generally supposed.
10.2307/1223063|Lemna minuta was proposed as a new species from Colombia in 1816 based on a collection that is now lost. The name is neotypified on the R. A. Philippi collection (STU) selected by Landolt (1986) as the "lectotype" for L. minuscula. Lectotypifications are proposed for L. valdiviana var. minima and L. minima.
10.2307/1223064|Haworthia glabrata (Salm-Dyck) Baker is a horticulturally common but taxonomically little known species. A detailed taxonomic and biosystematic study of H. glabrata and its apparent allies was recently undertaken and has revealed that this species name has never been typified. Aloe glabrata Salm-Dyck, the basionym of Haworthia glabrata, is here neotypified.
10.2307/1223065|In the literature, discrepancies exist with regard to the correct publication date of "Chamaealoe" Berger. The confusion concerns two publications of Alwin Berger which appeared in 1905 in "Engl. Bot. Jahrb." and in 1908 in "Das Pflanzenreich," respectively. The former publication has unfortunately been overlooked during recent revisions and this has led to an undesirable variance in citations of title and year of publication appended to the name "Chamaealoe." It is shown below that "Chamaealoe africana" (Haw.) Berger was validly published in "Engl. Bot. Jahrb." 36: 43 (28 February 1905).
10.2307/1223066|Several recent works which include the tribe Indigofereae have used author citations which are incorrect. The correct citation, Indigofereae Benth., is given and a summary of the relevant taxonomic history of the name for this taxon is presented.
10.2307/1223070|A survey of several names of genera related to Pyrenopsis (Nyl.) Nyl. is made. Collemopsis Nyl. ex Crombie is lectotypified by C. schaereri and is a synonym of Psorotichia Massal. The generic name Pyrenopsis (Nyl.) Nyl. is proposed for conservation with P. fuscatula Nyl. as conserved type, otherwise the name is a later synonym of Thelignya Massal.
10.2307/1223079|A common misunderstanding in the composition of botanical Latin compounds is discussed, and the actual rules for compound Latin and Greek words are exposed.
10.2307/1223084|In both folk taxonomy and science, the idea of species is based on the observation that phenotypic variation is discrete and not continuous. The definition of the species category, the "what," must therefore be restricted to these empirically demonstrable facts. To avoid circularity, concepts about the biological nature of species, the "whys," must be kept separate from the criteria by which individual species are circumscribed. Such ideas are models and can only be judged in terms of their capacity to bring observations into a meaningful context. The Biological Species Concept (BSC), the Evolutionary Species Concept (EvSC) and the Ecological Species Concept (EcSC) are models, not definitions. The BSC has its principal flaw in its inability to deal with uniparentally reproducing organisms. It fails to identify the driving force of speciation. It therefore fails to predict diversity and to explain why different species have different reproductive strategies. The EvSC fails to explain why different lineages are phenetically different. It fails, therefore, to explain why species arise, and why there are differences in diversity and reproductive strategies. The EcSC has the potential to make a direct connection between environment and phenetic variation patterns. It provides a useful conceptual framework for experimentation and observation at the interface between taxonomy and ecology and has the potential to explain on a universal basis variation in diversity and reproductive patterns. In some taxonomically difficult cases it also sheds light on the nature of variation patterns and might therefore help in taxonomic judgment where the BSC is conceptually inapplicable and the EvSC fails to provide useful concepts.
10.2307/1223085|In preparation for continued phenetic and cladistic studies of taxonomic relationships of Centrospermae, 16 families are recognized in the order, and putative autapomorphies are designated for each where known, in order to support their monophyletic status. Polyphyly in Phytolaccaceae s.l. and paraphyly in Caryophyllaceae, Chenopodiaceae, and Portulacaceae are discussed. Pollen and floral characters used in an early study are revised and recoded. Recent molecular data bearing on centrosperm phylogeny are summarized.
10.2307/1223086| [French] Chez Engler, bien que cela ne soit pas explicite dans le texte, l'expression "affinits naturelles" rfre a une notion de relation phylogntique. Il fait une distinction nette entre srie gntique et srie morphologique. Mais il n'a pas t jusqu' dire, comme le feront les auteurs contemporains, que ces deux types de srie peuvent tre contradictoires. Engler se demande comment dterminer les affinits naturelles des organismes. Ce problme touche deux aspects fondamentaux de la systmatique: la similarit entre les groupes et la dtermination du niveau volutif des caractres. D'aprs lui, l'tude de l'ontogense demeure le meilleur moyen pour connatre les affinits naturelles des organismes. Outre l'ontogense, c'est l'anatomie qui permet de dceler avec le plus de certitude les affinits taxonomiques. Pour dterminer le sens des sries morphologiques ou progressions, Engler se base sur le critre de complexit. De plus, il rsout le problme de l'volution en mosaque des caractres, en prenant en considration les niveaux initiaux  l'intrieur des taxons. Un des points importants qui ressort de cette analyse est la distinction faite par Engler entre classification et phylognie. Cependant, pour lui, les sries morphologiques sont quivalentes  des sries phylogntiques. La diffrence fondamentale entre les principes systmatiques de Engler et ceux des auteurs contemporains rside dans la reconnaissance par le premier de taxons polyphyltiques. Le systme de Engler n'est donc pas strictement phylogntique, si l'on entend par l la reprsentation exacte d'une phylognie qu'on connatrait. Il n'a pas cherch  construire un systme bas uniquement sur la phylognie. Son systme s'appuie sur des sries morphologiques dtermines  partir de principes qui relvent souvent d'ides trangres  la phylognie, comme le principe de perfectionnement. Chez Engler c'est la classification qui semble conduire  la phylognie et non l'inverse. Dans l'analyse de plusieurs sries volutives (type de fleur, nombre de verticilles staminaux, nombre de tguments), il utilise le concept de phylognie dans le sens des auteurs modernes; il parle de formes phylogntiquement plus anciennes. Sauf la reconnaissance de groupes polyphyltiques, le systme de Engler possde tous les lments de la taxonomie volutive dcrits par Stevens (1986). Mme si le systme et les principes de Engler ne rpondent pas aux critres de la systmatique cladistique, nous pouvons qualifier son systme de phylogntique, si l'on entend par l un systme reprsentant une gnalogie des plantes. /// For Engler, even if it is not explicit in his texts, the use of the expression "natural affinities" refers to a notion of phylogenetic relationships. In his reasoning, Engler makes a clear distinction between genetic series and morphological series. However, he did not go as far as to conclude, as have contemporary authors, that these two types of series can be contradictory. Engler asked himself how to determine the natural affinities of organisms. This problem concerns two fundamental aspects of systematics: the similarity between groups and the evolutionary level of characters. For him, the study of ontogenesis is the best means to discover the natural affinities between organisms. Beyond ontogenesis, it is the study of anatomy which allows us to determine with a high level of certitude the taxonomic affinities. To determine the direction of morphological series or progressions, Engler used the criterion of complexity. He solved the problem of mosaic evolution of characters, by considering the initial levels inside the taxa. One of the important points which comes out of this analysis is the distinction made by Engler between classification and phylogeny. Even so, for Engler, morphological series are equivalent to phylogenetic series. The fundamental difference between the systematic principles of Engler and those of contemporary authors is the recognition of Engler of polyphyletic taxa. The Englerian system is therefore not really phylogenetic, if we understand this concept to mean the exact representation of a phylogeny which is already known. He did not attempt to construct a system based only on phylogeny. His system is based on morphological series determined from principles which have no relationship with phylogeny, such as the principle of perfection. For Engler, it is the classification that seems to lead to the phylogeny, not the contrary. In the analysis of many evolutionary series (type of flower, number of staminal whorls, number of integuments) he used the concept of phylogeny in the sense of modern authors. Except for the acceptance of polyphyletic groups, the system of Engler has all the elements of the evolutionary taxonomy described by Stevens (1986). Even if the system and principles of Engler do not correspond to the criteria of cladistic systematics, we can nevertheless qualify his system as phylogenetic, if we understand this to mean a system representing a genealogy of plants. 
10.2307/1223087|The dating of the Prodromus and its two first supplements in Tenore's "Flora Napolitana" has been re-examined. The reconstruction of the fascicles of the first volume and the publication dates are assembled in a table.
10.2307/1223088| Nineteen populations of Allium schnoprasum L., distributed throughout the region between Lvis (near Qubec City) and western Newfoundland, Canada, were sampled for a study of morphological variation. These populations overlapped the eastern Canadian ranges of var. laurentianum Fern. (an endemic taxon of eastern North America) and var. sibiricum (L.) Hartm. (a circumboreal taxon). Twenty morphological characters were measured on 20 plants from each population. Kruskal-Wallis tests showed that (1) all the characters exhibited very significant differences between populations, and (2) 17 characters were different between habitats. Principal coordinate analyses, based on the 14 characters related more strongly to locality than to habitat, showed that similarity values were generally higher between populations from the same region. Using populations from both ends of the geographic gradient as a priori defined groups, canonical discriminant and classification analyses indicated that the overall variation pattern of A. schnoprasum was clinal on a longitudinal gradient. The proportion of plants per population classified in one or the other group changed gradually along that gradient, and longitude alone accounted for most of the variance in mean population discriminant scores. Populations from Newfoundland and the eastern part of the Gasp Peninsula, corresponding to var. laurentianum, are different from native populations of the upper St. Lawrence estuary region (var. sibiricum), but the clinal variation between these two extremes casts doubts on the need of retaining var. laurentianum in future taxonomic treatments of that species. Present variation patterns of A. schnoprasum in eastern North America are interpreted as resulting from widespread introgression, following secondary contacts between two population systems that survived Wisconsin glaciation in refugia situated around the Gulf of St. Lawrence and in southern New England, respectively. 
10.2307/1223089|The genus Luciliopsis (Fig. 1), described by Weddell (1855) for the minute Bolivian L. Gnaphaliinae (Asteraceae), and evidence for a transfer of this species to Chaetanthera of the tribe Mutisieae is presented.
10.2307/1223090|The Southeastern Regional Floral Information System (SERFIS), a multi-institutional specimen-based database, is being developed at the University of Alabama. At maturity, it will contain full label data for specimens housed in the nearly 120 herbaria of the southeastern United States. Specimen labels are photographed with still frame video cameras. Each label image is recorded digitally to disk on a microcomputer. These label images are viewed by trained data entry personnel and keyed into HERB, the SERFIS data management system. In the process of developing this regional database, institutional databases are being established at each participating herbarium to provide computerized collection management capabilities within each. The resultant SERFIS database is to be managed as a research resource for systematic and conservation investigations.
10.2307/1223091|Data recently presented suggest no correlation exists between pollen exine sculpturing and self-incompatibility systems in angiosperms is re-examined. All the variation that permits rejection of the correlation resides among 27 taxa designated as having gametophytic self-incompatibility. However, no empirical data have been published which support this designation. When these taxa are deleted and all the data are pooled there is a significant difference between exine perforations in sporophytic and gametophytic self-incompatible plants at the 0.95 confidence interval.
10.2307/1223112| Rigodium Kunze ex Schwaegr. is lectotypified on Poeppig s.n., 1828 from Monte Antuco, Chile (BM!), the type of R. implexum. This specimen is very likely part of the original material examined by Schwgrichen and Kunze according to accounts by Mller (1845, 1851). Additionally, Mller's (1845) description of Hypnum implexum, cited in "Index Muscorum" (1964) as a later homonym, actually represents a transfer of this epithet. 
10.2307/1223113|Lectotypes are designated for 31 species, mostly from Middle Asia, and a neotype for A. verticillatum Regel, from the materials housed at the V. L. Komarov Botanical Institute at Leningrad. Six other species can not yet be typified.
10.2307/1223114|The nomenclatural problems of three genera of Mesembryanthemaceae, Hymenogyne Haw., Thyrasperma N. E. Br., and Apatesia N. E. Br. are due to the fact that the herbarium sheets on which the description of the genus Thyrasperma was based involve specimens belonging to the other two genera. The names Hymenogyne and Apatesia are determined to be correct; after lectotypification, Thyrasperma is a younger synonym of Hymenogyne.
10.2307/1223115|The reticulated nomenclatural history of Agrimonia gryposepala Wallr. is discussed and its synonymy presented. Lectotypes are designated for A. gryposepala Wallr. and A. eupatoria [var.] hirsuta Muhl., as well as the names based on these basionyms, Eupatorium gryposepala (Wallr.) Lunell, A. hirsuta (Muhl.) Bicknell, and Eupatorium hirsutum (Muhl.) Nieuwland. The latter two combinations are shown to involve misidentifications, A. hirsuta sensu Bicknell and Eupatorium hirsutum sensu Nieuwland, of A. gryposepala Wallr.
10.2307/1223116| According to the "International Code of Botanical Nomenclature," the varietal epithet ochraceo-albidus in Mallotus oreophilus is preempted by that of the autonym M. oreophilus var. oreophilus, typified by "Hook. et Thoms. sub. Rottl. n. 5! quoad ." The name M. japonicus var. ochraceo-albidus (Mll.-Arg.) S. M. Hwang is therefore incorrect and the varietal epithet would have to be changed to oreophilus if this taxon is accepted. 
10.2307/1223117|The typification of 14 Linnaean names for European species of the Ericaceae is discussed. The names discussed all appeared first in the genus Erica L., with the exception of Andromeda polifolia L.

10.2307/1223120| The nomenclature of two hybrid origans is discussed: Origanum  applii (Domin) Boros nothosubsp. applii is supported for the hybrid formula Origanum majorana L.  Origanum vulgare L. subsp. vulgare, and the new combination Origanum  applii (Domin) Boros nothosubsp. majoricum (Cambess.) Xifreda, stat. nov. is applied to the hybrid formula Origanum majorana L.  Origanum vulgare L. ssp. virens (Hoffsgg. & Link) Ietsw. A brief account of morphological differences of both nothotaxa is given. /// [Spanish] Se aclara la nomenclatura de dos organos hbridos: Origanum  applii (Domin) Boros nothosubsp. applii permanece para la frmula hbrida Origanum majorana L.

10.2307/1223122|Teucrium bicoloreum Pau ex Vicioso is the correct name for T. angustifolium (Willk.) Peris et al. (1989). Teucrium bicoloreum is the oldest species name for this taxon and the combination T. angustifolium is a synonym (see below).
10.2307/1223123|The name Scenedesmus quadricauda has been applied, for more than 75 years, in a sense excluding its original type, to an important taxon of microscopic green algae (Chlorophyta, Chlorococcales), easy to grow in culture, therefore widely used in a variety of studies in different fields of science and thus cited in numerous scientific works, taxonomic or non-taxonomic. It had been previously rejected under Art. 69 but this decision should be reconsidered according to the new wording of Art. 69.3, as conservation of the name with a type preserving current usage would best serve stability.
10.2307/1223359|Fifty-six leaf microcharacters were studied in 132 OTUs of the Begoniaceae (Begonia, Hillebrandia). Their taxonomic distribution was compared to the existing classification (sections of Begonia), to leaf venation types, and to continental origin using the Mantel and the Smouse-Long-Sokal tests. Sections originating from the same continent appear to be more closely related on this basis than sections from different continents. Pinnate venation is hypothesized to be homoplasic.
10.2307/1223360|Vestiture of Barbeya is composed of various-sized, curly, unicellular, non-glandular trichomes. Attenuate, unicellular (micropapillate), non-glandular and capitate glandular trichomes common to all Urticales are absent. Pollen of Barbeya, unlike those of Urticales, is tricolporate, but like those of some more Hamamelididae, has a stratified wall structure containing a thin, granular layer. Evidence from trichome and pollen morphology, as well as from other sources, favors a transfer of Barbeya from Urticales into its own order Barbeyales. Barbeya may be an independent offshoot from a common ancestor of Casuarinales, Fagales, Juglandales, Myricales, and Urticales.
10.2307/1223361|An historical account is given of plant collectors in Honduras before 1945, the year when J. Lanjouw published a short list of plant collectors for Honduras with some confusion between Honduras and British Honduras. In particular, he noted R. Temple as a collector from the Republic of Honduras and not from the British colony, now Belize.
10.2307/1223362|The dimensions of typical forms of six species of Coleochaete: C. scutata, C. pulvinata, C. soluta, C. divergens, C. irregularis, and C. orbicularis, have been continuously overestimated due to a misinterpretation of an original account by Pringsheim (1860). In this paper correct dimensions are given, and 'small' forms of the species are discussed, most of them being found superfluous.
10.2307/1223363|Interactive videodisc information systems are explored as a format for the publication of floras. Images (drawings, photographs, etc.) are very useful in the important task of plant identification. The enormous image storage space and the random access capacity of videodiscs coupled with the information management capacity of personal computers can be an effective and cost-efficient tool for addressing the botanical information needs of botanists as well as interested non-botanists. Especially such systems would be helpful in the informational tasks involved in preserving the threatened biodiversity of the world's plants.
10.2307/1223364|Eight ratio variables measured on 85 OTUs from Raoulia subg. Raoulia were studied to explore their distributional properties and discriminating abilities. The ratios are shown to be generally less normal than their constituents, a property that can (to varying degrees) be alleviated by the choice of the numerator as the constituent with the largest coefficient of variation. The discriminating properties of the ratios are shown to be as good as their constituents individually, implying that the ratios are potentially useful variables with unique properties. The problem of redundant variability as a product of including a ratio variable and its two constituents in a data set is also addressed. Given that the deletion of one of these variables is a solution to this, it is shown that removing the ratio does not necessarily optimise the amount of retained variability. Thus, the use of ratio variables is seen to be an empirical a posteriori decision that can be made on the basis of objective criteria.
10.2307/1223365| The paper of Skov (1989) has provoked additional comments from an everyday Macintosh user, which hopefully will help future "Hypertaxonomists" find fully adequate solutions to their needs. The use of HyperCard as a database program for taxonomic data presents one with the problems of a relatively slow program that has a limited capacity for data exchange. This should be evaluated before working with large amounts of data using this program. A combination of dBaseMac and HyperCard is recommended as a push-button solution as easy to use as HyperTaxonomy by Skov (1989). 
10.2307/1223366|The taxonomic history of Nassella Desv. is reviewed and its circumscription expanded to include all species of Stipeae with strongly overlapping lemma margins; lemma apices that are fused into a crown; paleas that are highly reduced, ecostate, and glabrous; long epiblasts; and lemma epidermes with very short fundamental cells having silicified cell walls. The expanded genus includes 79 species, almost all of which are South American. Piptochaetium and Stipa sect. Hesperostipa are suggested as the closest extant relatives. Synapomorphies of the three taxa are: brownish callus hairs; fused lemma apices; bulbous-based lemma cilia; silicified lemma fundamental cells; and long epiblasts. A key to putatively monophyletic groups in American Stipeae and a synopsis of Nassella s.l., involving more than 60 new combinations, are presented. The transferred species include representatives from seven subgenera of Stipa L. described by Spegazzini.
10.2307/1223367|From late 1786 to mid-1787 Swartz worked at the Banksian Museum preparing his "Prodromus" (1788). Banks permitted him access to Solander's manuscripts, including a "Florula Indiae Occidentalis," as well as the specimens and literature underlying it. Many of Swartz's subsequently published names of new species (and genera) have the same names used in the "Florula." More than 10% of the names in Swartz's "Prodromus" are asterisked, meaning that they are based on materials (specimens and/or references) found in Banks' collections and appear in Solander's "Florula." The unpublished "Florula," aside from its contribution to Swartz's publications, is interesting because it cites collectors and localities, providing an insight into early records.
10.2307/1223368|The lycopsids exemplify the instability that characterises both formal (Linnean) and informal (colloquial) nomenclatural schemes for all supra-ordinal plant taxa. The scheme advocated here (Division Tracheophyta, Class Lycopsida; colloquial name lycopsid) reflects two underlying general principles: 1) A wide range of formal hierarchical levels should be used to indicate putative phylogenetic relationships, and 2) colloquial names should be standardised to most accurately represent the preferred Linnean names.
10.2307/1223369| [French] L'tude de la mose est mene chez les trois espces armoricaines du genre Ulex: U. europaeus L., U. minor Roth, U. gallii Planch. et chez des hybrides naturels. Cette tude permet d'tablir leur nombre chromosomique et de mettre en vidence de frquentes anomalies chez les cotypes prostrs d'U. gallii. /// A caryological study of meiosis was undertaken on the three armorican species of the genus Ulex: U. europaeus L., U. minor Roth, U. gallii Planch. and some natural hybrids. This study gives their chromosome numbers and revealed frequent abnormalities in the U. gallii prostrate ecotypes. 
10.2307/1223383|Eurhynchium brittoniae Grout is a rare moss endemic to western North America. The reassignment of this and other closely related species of Eurhynchium to the genus Kindbergia is a matter of controversy among bryologists. An investigation of these species has been undertaken to resolve this controversy. This paper resolves two taxonomic problems with respect to E. brittoniae. First, it elucidates an error in the protologue of this species that has been a source of confusion regarding its typification. Second, it reexamines morphological characters that historically have been relied upon to distinguish E. brittoniae from closely related species and evaluates their taxonomic value. The outcome of this paper is a lectotypification of E. brittoniae and the reassignment of this species as a synonym of Kindbergia praelonga (Hedw.) Ochyra.
10.2307/1223390|Ilex theaezans Bonpl. ex Miers was invalidly published as a synonym of Ilex paraguariensis A. St. Hil. (Aquifoliaceae). The existing information is summarized about I. theaezans, a name related to the first botanical description of the South American tree from which the yerba mate is obtained. An earlier homonym of I. theaezans Bonpl. ex Miers, Ilex theezans C. Martius ex Reisseck, which was effectively and validly published, pertains to a species clearly different from I. paraguariensis.
10.2307/1223392|The taxonomy of Hedyotis corymbosa (L.) Lam. and H. diffusa Willd. is highly problematic. We have now made detailed studies of these taxa and other closely related ones in India that are often confused. Hedyotis corymbosa has been found to be represented here only by var. corymbosa. Hedyotis erecta Manil. & Sivar., which was reduced to H. corymbosa var. linearis (DC.) Deb & Duatta, is reinstated. Hedyotis diffusa Willd. is recognised and H. pseudocorymbosa Bakh. f. reduced to its synonymy. The correct name for the taxon usually referred to as Oldenlandia diffusa (sensu Roxb.) is Hedyotis brachypoda (DC.) Sivar. & Biju, based on Oldenlandia brachypoda DC.
10.2307/1223393|A list of all known generic names in Annonaceae, including orthographic variants and nomina nuda, is given. Place and date of original literature, synonymy, and typification are mentioned. Enanita D. Oliver (not of Falconer) is given the new name Annickia, and ten new combinations are made. Some amendments to the conservation of 2679 Guatteria are proposed.
10.2307/1222917|The Aristideae are considered to include Aristida, Stipagrostis and Sartidia. The phylogenetic affinity of this tribe in the Poaceae remains controversial. To provide additional insight into the appropriate placement of the Aristideae, 21 species representing Aristida, Stipagrostis, Chloridoideae, Arundinoideae, and Hordeum (Pooideae) were analyzed for prolamin size heterogeneity and immunological cross-reactivities. Aristida species revealed species-specific prolamin subunit profiles. Immunological cross-reactivities measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblotting demonstrated that Aristida was distinct from the Arundinoideae and Chloridoideae. The prolamin profile of Stipagrostis differed from those of Aristida and the genus clustered with the Chloridoideae on the basis of immunological cross-reactivities. The data indicate the heterogeneity of the Aristideae, and suggest an isolated position for Aristida in the Poaceae rather than its placement in either the Arundinoideae or Chloridoideae.
10.2307/1222918|A new classification of the Commelinaceae above the generic level is presented. Two subfamilies are recognized, the Cartonematoideae, comprising two unigeneric tribes, Cartonemateae and Triceratelleae, and the Commelinoideae, containing the remaining 38 genera. Subfamily Commelinoideae is divided into two tribes, Tradescantieae, which is split into seven subtribes, each confined to either the Old or the New World, and Commelineae, which is not divided into subtribes.
10.2307/1222919|The three genera Athroisma, Blepharispermum and Leucoblepharis have previously been placed in the Inuleae. They constitute a monophyletic group whose inclusion in the Inuleae is rejected, on the basis of morphological evidence, and who instead belong to the Ecliptinae within the Heliantheae.
10.2307/1222920|Species formerly placed in Saxifraga ser. Ceratophyllae but having terminal inflorescences are segregated from those with axillary inflorescences as Saxifraga ser. Pentadactylis, comb. nova.
10.2307/1222921|This historical revision of the family Velloziaceae emphasizes a comparison between the two most recent systems of classification. The author's own opinion as to delimitation of Brazilian genera is given, and possibly represents an intermediary classification between those of Smith & Ayensu, and of Menezes.
10.2307/1222922|A recent suggestion that the poorly known Aloe penduliflora Baker is identical with Aloe confusa Engler is refuted. Living material collected in south-east Kenya is shown to be a closer match with all that is known of A. penduliflora. An amplified description of A. penduliflora is provided, and A. confusa is reinstated as a separate taxon.
10.2307/1222923|While conducting biosystematic investigations towards a revision of the smaller genera of the subfamily Alooideae of the Asphodelaceae in southern Africa to be published in the "Flora of southern Africa," I became aware that Chortolirion bergerianum Dinter had not been dealt with in recent treatments of this genus. A comparative palynological and morphological study indicates that C. bergerianum and C. angolense (Baker) A. Berger sensu lato are conspecific. Pollen grains of these taxa are free, monosulcate, bilaterally symmetrical, medium in size and have a perforated tectum. The morphological investigation and in-vitro and in-vivo pollen germination studies also confirmed that Chortolirion Berger represents an assemblage of both reproductive and vegetative characters that makes it unique in the Alooideae. However, the differences on which five species were previously based in Chortolirion are nothing more than local variations of a variable and widespread taxon. C. bergerianum should be included in C. angolense, the only species of Chortolirion. The taxonomic history of C. bergerianum is also briefly discussed.
10.2307/1222924|A review of the literature on Nyssa-like pollen in the fossil record reveals an unsurpassed nomenclatural snarl. There are repeated difficulties in determining whether names were validly published or not, let alone deciding on the correct name for a given taxon. Something is needed to clean up the past and avoid such snarls in the future.

10.2307/1222928|Lectotypes are designated for Campylaephora hypnaeoides J. Agardh, C. crassa (Okam.) Nakam. and C. crassa f. cymosa Nakam. It is argued that the author citation of C. crassa f. cymosa and f. borealis should be "Nakam.", not "(Okam.) Nakam.", because Okamura never validly published the epithet-bringing synonyms of these names.
10.2307/1222929|The fossil dinoflagellate cyst Gonyaulacysta filapicata Gocht has a variable precingular archaeopyle, type 1P to 5P, and a gonyaulacacean paratabulation with two small dorsal anterior intercalary paraplates. It is thus more appropriately placed in Durotrigia Bailey, and this transfer is effected herein.
10.2307/1222931| Phytelephas macrocarpa and P. microcarpa (Arecaceae), described by Ruiz & Pavn from Peru, are lectotypified and their identifies discussed. Ruiz's and Pavn's itineraries in the foothills of the Peruvian Andes and adjacent lowlands are reconstructed on modern maps. Some localities mentioned in Ruiz & Pavn's "Systema" are discussed. 
10.2307/1222933| Owing to their peculiar characteristics two species from South America, recently published by Fernndez Casas in Dichapetalum, were investigated. Each proved to represent a different species of Icacinaceae: Dichapetalum beckii is a new species in Casimirella Hassler, Dichapetalum prancei is a synonym of Casimirella guaranitica Hassler. 
10.2307/1222934|Examination of the lectotype (MO), designated here, of Cynanchum tetrapterum (Turcz.) Bullock, revealed that it is a synonym of Sarcostemma viminale (L.) R. Br. A new combination, Cynanchum gerrardii (Harvey) Liede, is required for the single leafless, stem-succulent African Cynanchum species to which the name C. tetrapterum had been misapplied. In addition, Asclepias aphylla Thunb. is lectotypified and also placed in synonymy under S. viminale.
10.2307/1222935|It is asserted that, after all, the correct name for the widespread Indo-Pacific species of Scaevola is Scaevola taccada (Gaertner) Roxb.
10.2307/1222972|Kato's recent hypothesis on the origin of the angiosperm carpel, suggesting an ophioglossoid fertile leaf as an archetype for the carpel, is evaluated in the context of heterochrony, which is argued to have been a major factor in the origin of angiosperms. Anatropy of angiosperm ovules, the most primitive type, is interpreted as derived by paedomorphosis from hyponastic curvature of ophioglossoid sporophore primordia and also leaf primordia, concomitant with paedomorphic changes at various levels of floral organization.
10.2307/1222973|A new, rapid, non-destructive technique for the preparation of pollen is described, in which dissected anthers are fixed with osmium tetroxide vapour. This method permits the examination without modifying the pollen grain morphology and ultrastructure and the natural state of hydration. Apertural structures are perfectly preserved and neither debris nor artifacts are deposited on the grains. The pollen cementing substances, such as pollenkitt, remain intact and can assist in the functional interpretation of pollen types. This new method may help to obtain optimal structural and functional information from pollen study.
10.2307/1222974|Color charts for biological descriptions have been published since 1776. These have varied in form to include bound volumes and fans with pigment samples or color printing and have been used to describe a range of organisms as specific as one genus to all natural history subjects. We recommend the format of the second edition of the Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart (c. 1986) in conjunction with the cross-reference for other color charts from the 1966 edition.
10.2307/1222975|Silica gels an inexpensive and reliable substance to preserve field-collected leaves for molecular studies of variation in DNA. A method for its utilization is explained, and results are presented, comparing total cellular DNA samples extracted from a set of fresh and silica-gel dried samples of the same species, as well as examining the efficiency of endonuclease restriction and intactness of DNA from of a set of field-collected leaves preserved with silica gel.
10.2307/1222976|Chromosome numbers are reported from all nine species (12 taxa) of Ludwigia sect. Oligospermum and sect. Oocarpon, including three not reported previously: L. hookeri (2n = 32), L. peduncularis (2n = 32), both of L. sect. Oligospermum, and L. torulosa (2n = 16) of the monotypic L. sect. Oocarpon. An earlier count of n = 8 for L. hookeri was based on a mis-identified specimen of L. peploides. Counts are also reported for three naturally occurring hybrids. Chromosome counts from a total of 141 strains are included, with full voucher information for each. New data are compared with all previous reports for the species of these sections.
10.2307/1222977|Neomangenotia ankaranensis Leroy, placed by that author in a monotypic subfamily of the Meliaceae on the basis of a single collection made by him from northern Madagascar, has recently been recollected and found to be congeneric with the large, widespread and mainly palaeotropical genus Commiphora (Burseraceae).
10.2307/1222978|Three outcrossing populations of Hedysarum spinosissimum subsp. capitatum and two self-pollinating populations of H. spinosissimum subsp. spinosissimum were surveyed for variation at 36 allozyme loci. The proportion of polymorphic loci ranged from 25.0 to 75.0% in subsp. capitatum and from 27.8 to 30.6% in subsp. spinosissimum, and the mean heterozygosity from 0.088 to 0.299 in subsp. capitatum and from 0.086 to 0.097 in subsp. spinosissimum. No karyotypic differences distinguish the two subspecies, and no hybridization between the allogamous H. spinosissimum subsp. capitatum and the autogamous subsp. spinosissimum was noted. Allele frequency differences between the two subspecies indicate that they are clearly distinct in several genes coding for the enzymes peroxidase, esterase and acid phosphatase. The level of genetic divergence at the enzyme level, revealed by electrophoretic analysis of the two taxa, supports their specific distinctness, the mean genetic distance between them being 0.45 -- which is indicative of a long period of lack of gene flow between them.
10.2307/1222979|The four ways of assessing the confidence limits in the nodes of a cladogram (character homologies, character numbers per node, bootstrap percentiles and the monophyly index) are reviewed. The methods are applied to a cladogram of the genera of the African Restionaceae, and the confidence limits of each node are discussed. It is shown that there is a great variation in the confidence limits of the various nodes. By combining the various methods it is possible to assess which nodes are not likely to change with the addition of new data, and which may change in the future. It is suggested that this method be employed in making decisions about the establishment of formal classifications, thus avoiding unnecessary changes in the formal taxonomy when further data result in small changes in the cladogram topologies.
10.2307/1222980|The life and achievements of Dr. Herbert F. Mooney are outlined, principally in regard to his involvement with the foundation of the National Herbarium of Ethiopia. Unpublished correspondence of Dr. Mooney with various Kew botanists documents his unique contribution to the early stages of that herbarium.
10.2307/1222981|The efficacy of 28 stem features at re-creating the classification of 13 established sections of Vaccinium was tested using taximetric analysis and was found to be wanting. However, adding three reproductive features to the matrix was sufficient to recover all of these sections. Stem characters will, therefore, recover specific groups previously circumscribed by a suite of both reproductive and vegetative features.
10.2307/1222982|HERBRECS is the herbarium records database of label information held in the Queensland Herbarium. It was initiated in 1971 using an automatic paper-tape punching typewriter which enabled the generation of labels for new accessions to be combined with the storage of label information on an indexed sequential magnetic tape masterfile. Capture of data from the existing herbarium collections started in 1975. Sequential tape storage was replaced by a custom-built database management system that became fully operational in 1981. Details of the development of the system are provided, and problems encountered are outlined. A wide range of users are requesting information from the database, particularly distributional information about taxa and floristic lists for given areas. Aside from taxonomic institutions most demand has come from conservation organisations and those involved in economic botany. The major challenge in the future will be to ensure that information associated with herbarium specimens, in particular the botanical name, remains identical to that stored on the computer masterfile while collections are being revised.
10.2307/1222984|The status of varietal "autonyms" of nontypical subspecies, found in quadrinomials that were made prior to the 1972 (Seattle) Code, is discussed. They are considered as validly published trinomial combinations, subject to fulfilment of the requirements of the present Code, rather than as quadrinomial expressions of classification. For instance, Hitchcock in 1964 proposed and accepted such varietal names intended as autonyms bur involuntarily validated by citation of the relevant basionyms. Later alleged validations of the same combinations are nomenclaturally irrelevant.
10.2307/1222985|Existing rules of the 'International code of botanical nomenclature' apply to the nomenclature of a DNA-based species concept. DNA can serve as the type element. Two hypothetical examples of validation of fictitious new mycological species are given, one for a mix of DNA and morphological type materials and the other for DNA type material only. It is recommended that herbaria prepare to curate genomic DNA material as types.
10.2307/1222990| Sideritis  murcica (Font Quer) Romo is accepted for hybrids derived from S. incana subsp. virgata (Desf.) Malagarriga and S. mugronensis Borja, which were first named S.  viciosoi var. murcica Font Quer. 
10.2307/1222992|The recent neotypification of Cenchrus carolinianus Walter (1788) should be ignored as unjustifiable in terms of the original circumscription. The rejection proposal should be opposed and Walter's name returned to its historic status of 'nomen dubium'. The generally accepted name, C. incertus M. Curtis (1837), may also be threatened by C. spinifex Cav. (1799).
10.2307/1222994|When Philip Miller proposed Toxicodendron (Anacardiaceae) for those species of Rhus generally called "poison-ivy" he accounted for six species from temperate eastern North America; previously, Linnaeus had recognized only two in Rhus. To date the Miller names have been essentially ignored, and none effectively typified. As now typified, T. pubescens becomes the earliest available name for the illegitimate T. toxicarium Gillis and for T. quercifolium (Michaux) E. Greene. Two Miller names are proposed for rejection, T. crenatum and T. volubile, to allow continued use of T. rydbergii Small ex Rydb. This is proposed simply to preserve nomenclatural stability.
10.2307/1223217|The tribe Stapelieae (Asclepiadaceae) is recircumscribed to include the Ceropegieae. The Stapelieae are distinguished from other tribes in the Asclepiadoideae primarily by the inner or apical germinating mouth on each pollinium. A tribal description and a tentative list of genera for the Stapelieae is given and a key to the tribes and subfamilies of Asclepiadaceae is provided.
10.2307/1223218|The widespread application of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) to plant biosystematics is usually based on a number of assumptions. The assumption of low levels of intraspecific cpDNA variation is reviewed and the conclusion reached that far from being rare, intraspecific cpDNA variation is relatively common. The evidence for the assumption of predominantly maternal plastid transmission is also reviewed. In both of the cases some of the possible effects on phylogenetic reconstruction are considered.
10.2307/1223219|A new genus of Velloziaceae is established comprising three species. Two are newly described, Burlemarxia rodriguesii and B. pungens, while the third, B. spiralis, had previously been assigned to Barbacenia. Taxonomic descriptions of all three species are provided, together with a key for identification. The relationships between Burlemarxia and the other three genera of subfamily Barbacenioideae are discussed.
10.2307/1223220|Relationships among taxa of Thlaspi sensu lato were tested by isoelectric focusing (IEF) analysis of Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). 14 species were studied, belonging to 3 of the genera previously segregated by Meyer on the basis of seed anatomy. Differences in Rubisco IEF patterns resulted in a grouping of the species into three clusters which are consistent with the respective genera of Meyer.
10.2307/1223221|Legumin-like 55 KD dimers were found to belong to a major seed storage protein in most genera of Pinaceae. However, the 12 Abies species investigated proved to be an exception, failing to reveal any such proteins in the seeds.
10.2307/1223222|Cardioteucris cordifolia C. Y. Wu and Caryopteris siccanea W. W. Smith, described in the Labiatae and Verbenaceae, respectively, represent the same species, best retained in Caryopteris rather than segregated as a monotypic genus Cardioteucris, and assigned to the Verbenaceae pending further clarification of family boundaries in the Lamiales.
10.2307/1223223| The inclusion of Hagenbachia in Liliaceae s.l. is reviewed and supported. The description and illustration of H. brasiliensis provided by Nees & Martius accurately fit the lectotype (at BR) and include a number of characters that are either rare or do not occur in Haemodoraceae, where it was originally placed. These characters, e.g., flowers in fascicles, jointed pedicels, glabrous tepals and inflorescences, and bifacial leaves are typical of Hagenbachia and related genera in Liliaceae. The type species name is correctly cited as H. brasiliensis Nees & Martius in Schultes. The type locality is in Bahia (Brazil), near to or along the Rio dos Ilhus upriver from Ilhus. 
10.2307/1223224|The name Scenedesmus quadricauda is frequently used for identification of a commonly observed fresh-water green alga. Many phycologists agree that the name has been misapplied very often in the last 75 years. Until recently we have not realized that one reason for this confusion is that there is no stable quadricaudate taxon, but rather quadricaudate ecomorphs of several spiny species. It is postulated that every spiny species may have this ecomorph, as does S. communis on which experimental data are here presented.
10.2307/1223225|The richness of the Leningrad Herbarium, both with regard to specimen numbers and to their value for science, is pointed out and contrasted against the dilapidated state of the herbarium building. If the herbarium, and the equally priceless library, are to be maintained for the future, the international community will have to help so that an entirely new building can be provided.
10.2307/1223226|Approves the German edition of the Code and, with comments, proposals recommended by the Spermatophyta Committee Report 36.
10.2307/1223227|The type specimens of 13 species of red algal parasites described from California by W. A. Setchell are discussed with regard to collection data and current physical condition as conserved in UC. Five of these types are the types of generic names (Faucheocolax, Gracilariophila, Jantinella, Plocamiocolax, and Rhodymeniocolax). Discrepancies, errors, and expressions of doubt that have appeared in the citation of types by subsequent workers are clarified. The correct name for the host of Colacodasya verruciformis is shown to be Chondria acrorhizophora Setchell & Gardner when this species is united with C. californica (Collins) Kylin.
10.2307/1223228| Type material of Isymenia flabellata J. Agardh was examined and determined to conform to Sebdenia. The transfer of this taxon to Sebdenia by Parkinson is supported. Sebdenia flabellata (J. Agardh) Parkinson is regarded to be the correct name for a red algal species that includes Sebdenia polydactyla (Brgesen) Balakrishnan. Its taxonomic separation from the superficially similar Halymenia trigona (Clemente) C. Agardh is confirmed. 
10.2307/1223229|Lectotypes are designated or confirmed for the names of 6 Linnaean Phalaris species, plus one variety. Traditional usage is maintained in all cases. P. aquatica L. (syn. P. tuberosa L., P. bulbosa auct.) cannot be rejected as a nomen confusum, a category of name that no longer exists. P. bulbosa L. is kept in synonymy under Phleum subulatum (Savi) Ascherson & Graebner, also lectotypified here. The type of Phalaris arundinacea L. belongs to the widespread tetraploid cytotype. The hexaploid bears the name P. arundinacea subsp. oehleri Pilger (holotype verified) of which P. caesia Nees, here lectotypified, is a synonym.
10.2307/1223230|The weedy species long known as Nothoscordum fragrans is N. borbonicum Kunth, not N. gracile. It is postulated that N. borbonicum originated as a natural hybrid between two wild species, N. entrerianum and genuine N. gracile, in the area of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The differences between N. gracile and N. borbonicum are given. Nothoscordum subg. Euryscordum (type: N. gracile) is proposed to replace N. subg. Platyscordum, the type of which, N. inodorum, belongs in Allium.
10.2307/1223231|Since no original material of Curatella americana L. appears to have survived, the original Loefling collections being presumed lost, a neotype from near the region in which Loefling collected is designated.
10.2307/1223232|Rhus hirta (L.) Sudworth is based on Datisca hirta L., a name long rejected as a monstrosity but which has priority over Rhus typhina L. (1756). Three formae of the North American staghorn-sumac are recognized: Two cultivated, f. hirta (including R. typhina f. laciniata (Wood) Rehder) and f. dissecta (Rehder) Reveal; one wild, R. hirta f. typhina (L.) Reveal (here lectotypified).
10.2307/1223233|The name Daphne alpina L. is lectotypified by an illustration of l'Obel, which safeguards traditional usage. The species appears to have been variously confused, by Linnaeus and other authors, with Daphne collina Vahl.
10.2307/1223234| The earlier lectotypification of Cytisus hirsutus L., in the sense of C. villosus Pourret by Skalick, disrupting usage and constituting a potential threat to the latter name, is superseded as being in conflict with the protologue. The new lectotype, a specimen in the Burser Herbarium, enables continued use of the name in the traditional sense. C. supinus L., lectotypified here, is considered a taxonomic synonym of the simultaneously published C. hirsutus. 
10.2307/1223235| Lectotypes are proposed for the basionyms of two taxa widely known under the designation of, e.g., Calamintha nepeta (L.) Savi subsp. nepeta and subsp. glandulosa (L.) P. Ball, and also for Calamintha officinalis Moench ( Melissa calamintha L.) usually treated as synonymous to the latter. New morpho-anatomical and phytochemical studies suggest, however, that these are seasonal morphs rather than discrete taxa and that they do not deserve recognition, not at any rate at a supra-varietal level. 
10.2307/1223236|Linnaeus based Erigeron carolinianus on a Dillenian illustration drawn from deformed, greenhouse-grown plants of Euthamia (Solidago) tenuifolia (Pursh) E. Greene. Although the Linnaean name has been ignored because it was based on a monstrosity, the name cannot be rejected (Art. 69.1) because it has not been widely or persistently used for a taxon not including its type. Accordingly, Solidago caroliniana (L.) Britton & al. or Euthamia caroliniana (L.) E. Greene ex Porter & Britton must be taken up for this common eastern North American species of bushy golden-rod.
10.2307/1222765|Within the Asphodelaceae the subfamily Alooideae is a natural (monophyletic) group. All the genera in this subfamily are therefore considered to have evolved from a common ancestor, based on the possession of character states which distinguish this complex from all other genera of the Asphodelaceae. However, no comprehensive interpretation of phylogenetic relationships within the entire subfamily based on comparative morphological data and phytogeographical considerations has yet been accomplished. The present paper investigates phylogenetic relationships of the genera Aloe, Astroloba, Chortolirion, Gasteria, Haworthia, Lomatophyllum and Poellnitzia using cladistic methodology. The most obvious similarities amongst these genera are the succulent leaf consistency, crescentiform or cymbiform leaf outline in cross-section and the markedly bimodal karyotype of 2n = 14 chromosomes. For the cladistic analysis 16 characters were used and the genus Kniphofia was selected as outgroup on the basis of two synapomorphies with Alooideae, namely tubular flowers and fused perianth segments. The characters are discussed in detail, polarized into plesiomorphic and apomorphic states and then employed in the generation of a phylogenetic hypothesis using the "Hennig86" software package.
10.2307/1222766|The Zavada hypothesis, that there is a correlation between the various types of self-incompatibility mechanisms found in angiosperms and details of pollen exine sculpturing, is addressed again. In the light of a recent further defence of the hypothesis, some errors in the original data on which it was based are considered, and some criticisms by Zavada of a different data base are discussed.
10.2307/1222767|This paper reports the discovery in the Madrid herbarium of a significant set of about 1000 specimens collected by Charles Wright in Cuba during the years 1856-1867. An analysis is presented of the 33 included specimens of Malvaceae, among which six types were identified.
10.2307/1222768|The storage conditions in 4 Scandinavian herbaria have been checked, including indoors climate, mounting techniques, paper qualities etc. Serious damage to plant specimens glued to standard herbarium sheets has been found, while specimens mounted by traditional paper strips were unaffected by changing temperature and relative humidity.
10.2307/1222769|Rottler travelled widely and collected extensively in peninsular India. His publication of 1803, with added remarks by Willdenow, is cited in floras pertaining to India and the adjoining regions. Rottler and Willdenow validated names of 2 and 1 new genus, and 47 and 21 new species, respectively, in this paper. Most authors have not seen this work and errors, such as wrong attribution of authors, overlooked priority, ignored valid names, are frequently repeated. Below, Rottler's and Willdenow's names are listed separately after a discussion. Types of many of these names are in the Willdenow Herbarium in Berlin (B-W).
10.2307/1222770| Clerodendrum cecil-fischeri is a replacement name for C. fischeri Naithani & Bennet 1983, non Grke 1894. 
10.2307/1222771|It is shown that Sida radiciflora C. Presl is to be removed from the Malvaceae and placed in the Geraniaceae as a synonym of Geranium sericeum Willd. ex Sprengel.
10.2307/1222772| Polygala alpina subsp. somedana Lanz was described as an endemic taxon of the Cantabrian mountains (N. Spain). Recent studies demonstrate, that it belongs to P. calcarea F. W. Schultz rather than to P. alpina (DC.) Steudel. The required new combination is validated. 
10.2307/1222773| Davilia Mutis has been thought to be Euphorbiaceae (Croton) or Sapindaceae (Paullinia?). By neotypification it becomes a synonym of earlier Llagunoa Ruiz & Pavn (Sapindaceae). 
10.2307/1222774|Both Plagiopteron suaveolens Griffith and P. fragrans Griffith, simultaneously validly published, are in use. The former is correct.
10.2307/1222775|The taxonomic history of the controversial names Cactus ficus-indica and Opuntia ficus-indica (Cactaceae) is discussed. An analysis of the changing interpretation of these names demonstrates the necessity of formal typification in order to achieve nomenclatural stability. A specimen in the Linnaean herbarium at Stockholm is designated as the neotype of C. ficus-indica. By interpreting this name as the basionym of O. ficus-indica, the long-established name of the commercially most important cactus species can be saved.
10.2307/1222776|Mediocactus Britton & Rose is typified by the type of Mediocactus coccineus (DC.) Britton & Rose, the neotype of which is here superseded. Thereby Mediocactus maintains its original sense and does not become a synonym of Heliocereus.
10.2307/1222777|Periploca secamone L. and Secamone thunbergii E. Meyer, here first lectotypified, are synonyms of Secamone alpini Schultes.
10.2307/1222778|The lectotype of Doronicum carpetanum Boiss. & Reuter ex Willk., a variable species, is a specimen in the Willkomm herbarium (COI) collected in the Sierra de Guadarrama by Boissier & Reuter in July 1858.
10.2307/1222779|Fracastora Bubani, non Adanson, included six binomials. All are attributable to species of Sideritis and three are illegitimate renamings. Fracastora Adanson is first lectotypified.
10.2307/1222780|Hibiscus furcatus Roxb. ex DC. and H. aculeatus Roxb. are illegitimate later homonyms of H. furcatus Willd. and H. aculeatus Walter, respectively. The earliest available name for the common Indian taxon to which they pertain is H. hispidissimus Griffith.
10.2307/1222781|Holodiscus Maxim. was originally conserved, in 1905, against Schizonotus Raf., which subsequently was shown to be a later homonym and was therefore deleted as a rejected name. Despite its conserved status, Holodiscus must yield to Sericotheca Raf. when the genus is circumscribed to include H. argenteus, the type of the latter generic name. In view of the confusion that may arise when Sericotheca is used as the correct name while Holodiscus remains in the list of conserved names, it is proposed to add Sericotheca as a rejected name under Holodiscus. It is also proposed to accredit the conserved name directly to Maximowicz, as the name was originally conserved, rather than to (K. Koch) Maximowicz as initiated in 1961 in the Montreal "Code".
10.2307/1222480|A procedure of combining trees obtained from data sets of different kinds, similar to Brooks's technique but for a different purpose, with the aim of combining these data sets, is detailed along with examples used in five unrepeated combinations from a total of 15 published datasets. The procedure does not adjoin raw data sets, but instead combines the binary-coded factors of the trees, each tree from a different data set, together. This allows the combining of data that are only available as pair-wise distances with data obtained directly from characters of the organisms. It economizes the analysis of combined nucleotide sequence data which can be very large, and preserves information for each kind of data in the combination. The procedure allows for missing data as well, and can be regarded as a new consensus method -- mathematical properties have yet to be investigated. The desirability of combining gene trees, obtained from molecular data, to enable the inference of species trees is discussed in light of using this procedure.
10.2307/1222481|The type of intermediacy that separates hybridity from divergence is not multivariate intermediacy; it is the coincidence of intermediate character states. For the purpose of showing hybridity, analyses should distinguish between the two types of intermediacy. (1) Hybrid indices fail to do so. (2) Principal components analysis does so only in an ambiguous way. (3) Pictorialized scatter diagrams properly present the evidence for an interpretation that is intuitive. (4) Counting characters as intermediate or not-intermediate is an explicit approach that allows for statistical evaluation given that certain assumptions are made. Simulated data representing hybridity and divergence are presented to illustrate each method and to provide a prototype of how to document hybridity using the favored methods.
10.2307/1222482|The protologue of Aloe archeri Lavranos is based mainly on material that was not gathered at the stated type locality, and includes characters of two distinct taxa. The type specimen is missing, but strong circumstantial evidence indicates that it originates from a plant collected far from the stated type locality. A neotype is designated for A. archeri, and an amended description is presented. Plants from the stated type locality of A. archeri are described as a new species.
10.2307/1222483|Flora Hibernica by J. T. Mackay, T. Taylor and W. H. Harvey was published on 15 June 1836 in Dublin. Although well received by botanists, the number of copies sold was small. Taylor was critical of the book, especially of Harvey's treatment of the algae, and he tried unsuccessfully to persuade Mackay to published a revised, less bulky edition which could be sold at a lower price.
10.2307/1222484|This paper addresses the importance of spatial resolution and data accuracy for the development and use of herbarium data with geographic information systems (GIS). Using the Pennsylvania Flora Database as an example, we discuss the variable quality of the spatial information in herbarium databases and present suggestions for standardizing spatial information for future data collection. GIS applications are discussed and examples of these applications are provided.
10.2307/1222485| The herbarium of the Department of Biological Sciences of the Pontificia Universidad Catlica del Ecuador in Quito (QCA) holds more than 100,000 specimens and is increasing by 11,500 sheets per year, making it the largest in Ecuador and one of the most important collections of Ecuadorean plants in the world. The history and progress of this herbarium during its first 20 years of existence are presented. Information about the development of the collections, herbarium infrastructure, important collections, and the exchange program is also given. 
10.2307/1222486|Koelera laurifolia Willd. was based on elements now assigned to Drypetes alba and D. lateriflora (both Euphorbiaceae), and Xylosma coriacea (Flacourtiaceae). The material of D. lateriflora corresponds most closely to the protologue and so is designated as the lectotype. Koelera Willd. is treated as a later homonym of Koeleria Pers.
10.2307/1222487|A new species is described as Helictotrichon cintranum, a name that replaces a series of invalidly published names, starting with Avenochloa albinervis subsp. occidentalis Gervais.
10.2307/1222488| Dinobryon faculiferum Willn replaces Dinobryon petiolatum Willn 1963, non Dujardin 1841. 
10.2307/1222489|Some species names would be nomina nuda if there was not a reference to an earlier publication with a validating description. These, under Art. 7.15, must be typified by an element from the context of the referenced description. Most Linnaean species names, specifically the ones cited by Heath, are validated by simultaneously published description/diagnoses. These are to be typified from original material used by Linnaeus, even if the description/diagnosis was copied from earlier literature.
10.2307/1222490|Asterella P. Beauv. has been used for two different genera of Hepaticae, represented by the two protologue elements: Marchantia tenella L. and M. hemisphaerica L. Typification by M. tenella L., implied by Raddi's segregation of M. hemisphaerica L. as a unispecific genus "Rebouillia" in 1818, was first formally proposed by Evans in 1923. Unfortunately, Asterella had been effectively typified by the second element, M. hemisphaerica L., long before this, by Leman in 1823. Conservation with Evans's type is needed. Fimbraria Nees, an illegitimate later homonym of the algal Fimbriaria Stackh., and Hypenantron Corda are later synonyms of Asterella, if conserved as proposed.
10.2307/1222491|Lectotypes are designated for the four species of Aralia (Araliaceae) described by Linnaeus in 1753. The possible origins and fates of the original material is speculated upon with the suggestion that several of the critical specimens are seemingly missing or mistakenly labelled.
10.2307/1222492| The Festuca souliei St.-Yves types were studied and a lectotype designated, confirming the parentage cited in the protologue, F. eskia and F. quadriflora. Festuca picoeuropeana Nava is the name for the hybrid between F. eskia and F. gautieri. 
10.2307/1222493|Festuca lasto Boiss. is a frequently overlooked binomial. It was illegitimately replaced by F. altissima Boiss. and F. boissieri Janka. It is accepted here for an Iberian species close to F. altissima All.
10.2307/1222494|Riddelia Raf., long considered to be a taxonomic synonym of Melochia L. (Sterculiaceae), is a synonym of Corchorus L. (Tiliaceae). Its type, R. antiphyla Raf., is conspecific with Corchorus hirtus L.
10.2307/1222495|The name Pterygota amazonica, invalidly published by L. O. Williams, is here validated.
10.2307/1222496|Monvillea Britton & Rose is typified by the type of Monvillea cavendishii (Monville) Britton & Rose, a neotype for which is here selected, whereby Monvillea maintains its original sense and does not become a synonym of Acanthocereus.
10.2307/1222497| Aloysia was first published by Palau, not Jussieu nor Persoon as commonly listed. Subsequently L'Hritier published Verbena triphylla for the same species. The correct name for the economically important lemon verbena in Aloysia is A. citrodora Palau, and in Lippia it is L. triphylla (L'Hr.) Kuntze. 
10.2307/1222498|Nomenclatural priority in pleomorphic fungi is regulated by Article 59 of the "Code". We show that Article 59 can be interpreted in more than one way. By the broad interpretation in current use, the potential for pleomorphy is assumed of all fungi and the Article is applied to all fungi. Fungi without a demonstrated sexual state are classified in the form taxon, Deuteromycotina, until a sexual state is found. With an alternative and strict interpretation, however, Article 59 would apply only to fungal species that have been actually demonstrated to be pleomorphic. Under the latter interpretation, sexual, asexual, and pleomorphic fungi would be classified together and form taxa would not be necessary.
10.2307/1222499|The Committee for Fungi and Lichens reports its decisions on 45 proposals to conserve/reject names, recommending 21.
10.2307/1222327|The two South African-Namibian genera Hoplophyllum and Eremothamnus share two unique floral microcharacters. It is concluded that they are sister groups belonging in an extended tribe Eremothamneae.
10.2307/1222328|The same, unique type of stylar sweeping hairs that had been used in defining the originally monogeneric tribe Eremothamneae has been found in Hoplophyllum. This underscores the close relationship of Hoplophyllum and Eremothamnus and the distinctness of Eremothamneae to which they both belong.
10.2307/1222329|Phylogenetic relationships among selected families of the Caryophyllales were examined by analyses of nucleotide sequences of the large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rbcL). Sequences from 12 Caryophyllalean families were examined using parsimony and bootstrap analysis. The parsimony analysis produced two minimal trees with 778 steps. Major clades supported by bootstrap analysis are (1) Amaranthus (Amaranthaceae), Atriplex and Spinacia (Chenopodiaceae); (2) Mirabilis (Nyctaginaceae), Rivina (Petiveriaceae), Phytolacca (Phytolaccaceae) and Trianthema (Aizoaceae); (3) Basella (Basellaceae), Alluaudia (Didiereaceae), Portulaca (Portulacaceae) and Schlumbergera (Cactaceae); and (4) Silene, Dianthus, Arenaria and Cerastium (Caryophyllaceae). The Caryophyllaceae and Mollugo are the only taxa examined that do not produce betalains but they are neither closely allied nor basal to other elements of the order. Stegnosperma is not allied with the Mirabilis-Rivina-Phytolacca-Trianthema clade. Thus, the Phytolaccaceae (s.l.) are not monophyletic.
10.2307/1222330|In a recent monograph on the Chrysobalanaceae, by Prance & White, a number of analytical methods currently employed by systematists, in particular cladistic analysis and vicariance biogeography, were criticised and dismissed as not being biologically informative. The criticisms made are discussed here, in particular the problems caused by parallelism, the detection, selection and coding of characters, and the role of functional considerations in systematics. A phylogenetic analysis is performed using the data presented in the monograph and this is compared with the classification of the Chrysobalanaceae presented by Prance & White. Some possible reasons for the discrepancies between the two are discussed.
10.2307/1222331|An automated data bank of the sedge genera of the world has been developed using the DELTA system. The 122 narrowly defined genera are described in detail in terms of morphology, anatomy, photosynthetic pathways, synonyms, ecology, distribution, and classification. This paper describes an INTKEY version of the data bank (available for MS-DOS microcomputers), and illustrates its use for interactive identification and data retrieval.
10.2307/1222332|Senecio australis Willd. is based on a Forster specimen said to be from New Zealand but has never again been collected there. Willdenow's name was misapplied by Sprengel to a taxon of the S. linearifolius complex of Australia, a usage rejected by Willis (1957). Hooker and Bentham both supposed S. australis to be some part of S. lautus G. Forster ex Willd. The question has remained controversial. It is here demonstrated that specimens collected on Norfolk Island and adjacent islets are identical with the holotype of S. australis, and are specifically distinct from the holotype of S. lautus. These two species are readily distinguished by consistent significant differences in calycular bracteoles, numbers of ray florets, and other features.
10.2307/1222339|Lectotypification is a serious matter and aspects of the current "Code" do not make things easier, suggesting the need for amendments.
10.2307/1222340|Nineteen new combinations for taxa of Mediterranean algae are validated.
10.2307/1222341|Because the widely distributed, atypical species known as Stigmaphyllon ovatum (Cav.) Niedenzu was discovered to include the type of Malpighia bannisterioides L., a name long-ignored, the new combination Stigmaphyllon bannisterioides is proposed.
10.2307/1222342|The type of Ancistrocactus (Schumann) Britton & Rose is A. uncinatus (Pfeiffer & Otto) Benson (Echinocactus uncinatus Pfeiffer & Otto).
10.2307/1222343|Festuca capillifolia Dufour and F. scaberrima Lange have been considered as synonyms. Original material in Dufour's herbarium was found to be mixed and a lectotype is designated, confirming usage.
10.2307/1222813|Renewed enthusiasm for databases containing descriptive information about species, and taxa at other levels, is based upon two assumptions: (1) that computers increase our efficiency in managing data and (2) that the descriptions, once stored, will serve diverse purposes. These assumptions are examined in the light of ten years of practical datamanagement. Descriptions based on 118 characters were compiled for Angiosperm families, subfamilies, tribes or genera represented in Veracruz, Mexico. Keys including various printed dichotomous keys, a polyclave and diagnostic descriptions were produced in English and Spanish. An interactive computer program for specimen identification proved particularly useful and enabled students to explore family delimitations. For critical or fragmentary material, identification based on simultaneous use of all available characters, though more laborious, gave better results. Existing software was modified for ease of use and for Spanish speakers. Since the first version of the data set was completed, nine years ago, the data have undergone slow but significant development: errors have been corrected, characters added, descriptions refined, and families further subdivided. These changes have improved the precision and the efficiency of identification. As the data set evolves, new keys are written to serve applied scientists and botanists working in Veracruz. Development costs were due largely to lack of suitable data management software. Major benefits include (1) the production of keys tailored for particular users from the outset, (2) the easy replacement of keys as the data improve, and (3) collation of a data set of quality which will be of continuing future use. Minor modifications of the character definitions were recognised for diverse diagnostic purposes but proved unsatisfactory for description writing and classification. These findings are of significance to those planning descriptive biological database projects elsewhere.
10.2307/1222814|The monotypic Poellnitzia Uitewaal is one of seven genera recognized in the subfamily Alooideae (Asphodelaceae). It is endemic to a small area in the Robertson Karoo, south-western Cape Province, South Africa. A synthesis of natural history observations, breeding experiments and all available information on, amongst others, inflorescence architecture, flower morphology, floral attractants and rewards and several floral inhabitants and visitors, suggest that a newly described species of mite, Adhaerenseius floralis Loots & Theron, and its phoretor(s) probably fulfil the role of pollination agents. It is also proposed that the connivent flowers of Poellnitzia serve as seasonal "acarodomatia" and that this association is comparable in scope to the widely recognized mite-leaf domatia associations.
10.2307/1222815|The use of an iconic representation of many traits for the description and classification of forest tree clones is suggested. Among the kinds of icons available, the cartoon-like representation known as Chernoff's faces was chosen. This graphic technique has proved to be effective for discriminating among 50 clones of common cypress selected for resistance to canker. As descriptors, besides morphological characteristics, the content of five monoterpenes and the polymorphism of six isozymatic loci were considered.
10.2307/1222816|This article offers historical and philosophical perspectives on the debate generated by the proposed name change of the Botanical Society of America. Historical and philosophical examination of the lives of disciplines like botany reveal a process of ordering and systematization analogous to botanical practices. The taxonomist of knowledge like the taxonomist of plants constructs categories or groupings which are provisional constructs of the disciplined "eye" of the taxonomist. The emergence of botany -- a category or "branch" of knowledge -- has been disciplined as such a category, and along with it has come the contentious issue of proper accurate naming of the practice. The "growth" of botany -- especially in America -- is examined through a re-examination of representations of the "trees of knowledge".
10.2307/1222817|A study of the William and Joseph Hooker archives at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, has provided a clear picture of the 1843 itinerary in Ecuador and southern Colombia of the British plant collector, William Lobb. Solanum lobbianum (sect. Petota) was described by Georg Bitter based on a single type specimen at Kew, but because it had not been re-collected since 1843 it was presumed to be extinct. "Lobb Columbia" was the only label information. It has now been re-collected twice in Ecuador by a recent American expedition, and from the archival and other information detailed here it seems likely that the type specimen was gathered in Ecuador also.
10.2307/1222818|Seed proteins have been studied by electrophoresis in 29 wild taxa of the genera Diplotaxis, Erucastrum and Brassica (Brassicinae). Protein data were subjected to multivariate analysis, and the results were plotted on a two-dimensional scatter diagram. They support the idea of a close affinity among all taxa, and are largely consistent with evolutionary patterns that had been inferred previously through the study of seed, seedling and fruit morphology.
10.2307/1222819|Infraspecific classification of plants continues to be practiced commonly by taxonomists: c. 8% of species monographed in 26 major journals and series during the period 1987-1990 were subdivided. Of those, c. 42% were divided into subspecies only, 52% into varieties, 3% into formae, and 3% into taxa of more than one level. Subspecies and varieties are usually defined as requiring some integrity -- geographic, ecologic, and/or phylogenetic -- beyond the morphological. Despite some attempts to differentiate between subspecies and variety, they are largely equivalent in practice. European taxonomists tend to favor subspecies, whereas their counterparts in the United States usually employ variety. Formae usually are defined as lacking any extramorphological integrity. Given the general inconsistency of practice found, it is imperative that more authors state briefly their philosophy of infraspecific taxonomy so their classifications may be interpreted more clearly. Taxonomists collectively should promote greater standardization of infraspecific classification.
10.2307/1222820|Westerners have thousands of different family names but only a few hundred common given names. Thus, in a western personal name, the family name is discriminative and abbreviating the undiscriminative given name(s) makes sense. Chinese have only a few hundred common family names but thousands of given names. Western conventions of abbreviating given names are therefore inappropriate for Chinese personal names. Different traditions of "western" and Chinese personal nomenclature are discussed, and suggestions are made on how to handle Chinese names in a western bibliographic context.
10.2307/1222821|There is some ambiguity in what is meant by the word "specimen" in the "International code of botanical nomenclature." Some cases are discussed and the need for amending the Code, as well as adding certain examples, is considered.
10.2307/1222822|Art. 8.3 was added to the "International code of botanical nomenclature" at the Berlin Congress to establish the minimum requirements for the formal designation of a lectotype or neotype and to invalidate the practice of residual typification. Although it effectively stabilizes generic typifications, the wording of Art. 8.3 forces the acceptance of any use of the term "type" or its equivalent to be an effective lectotypification or neotypification and this can have unforeseen, destabilizing consequences for species and infraspecific names.
10.2307/1222823|Species that hybridize to form allopolyploids may become extinct, yet may be discovered and characterized through the continued existence and expression of their genomes in their allopolyploid descendants. For purposes of nomenclature, these genomically preserved plants (GPPs) form a third category of plants, along with recent plants and fossils, with which they share certain kinds of characters. GPPs are essential to understanding the phylogeny of some species complexes and can be included as OTUs in phenetic and phylogenetic analyses. A means to provide for the naming, description, and typification of taxa of genomically preserved plants needs to be included in the "International code of botanical nomenclature."
10.2307/1222824| The new combination Echinochloa esculenta based on Panicum esculentum A. Braun is proposed to replace E. utilis Ohwi & Yabuno, a junior synonym of it. A neotype is designated in the Krnicke Herbarium, now in Berlin (B): a cultivated plant grown from seeds collected in Japan 1860-1861. 
10.2307/1222825|Different possibilities of forming Latin geographical adjectival epithets in binomials are analysed, and suggestions are presented to standardize their formation.
10.2307/1222826|Results from current comparative morphological studies of both the phycoma and motile stages of fossil and modern Prasinophyceae indicate generic identity between the fossil Tasmanites E. Newton and the modern Pachysphaera Ostenfeld. According to Article 58 of the "International code of botanical nomenclature," names of fossil taxa yield priority to names of non-fossil taxa, but with algae excepted. Thus Tasmanites is the correct name for the taxon currently known as Pachysphaera.
10.2307/1222827|Ten later homonyms have been used for good species that require renaming.
10.2307/1222828|The nomenclature of many alooid genera is highly problematical. The present note, which originated in the context of a taxonomic study of the southern African genus Poellnitzia Uitewaal, resolves a complex nomenclatural problem with respect to Apicra jacobseniana Poellnitz. It is shown that this species name was published validly by Poellnitz and not Uitewaal, and that it has been combined validly at varietal rank under P. rubriflora (L. Bolus) Uitewaal but not under Haworthia rubriflora (L. Bolus) Parr.
10.2307/1222829|Type material of "Lactoris fernandeziana" Philippi was examined and the name lectotypified. The name was found to have been published validly first in the "Anales de la Universidad de Chile" rather than in the place cited by "Index kewensis" and "Index nominum genericorum (plantarum)".
10.2307/1222830| Turraea virens L., the type of Turraea L. (Meliaceae), is here lectotypified with a Knig specimen from the Comores. T. ticoraeopsis Baillon is a synonym and this taxon is close to the type of Naregamia Wight & Arn. 
10.2307/1222831| The dates of publication of the English and German editions of Knebel's "Phyllokakteen" are ascertained. Valid publication of  Aporodisocactus Knebel and  Aporoheliocereus Knebel is confirmed. 
10.2307/1222832|Lectotypes are designated for Tragopogon pratensis L., T. orientalis L., T. porrifolius L., T. crocifolius L. and T. villosus L. The latter is considered to be a name of uncertain application, at least as far as the Iberian Peninsula is concerned.
10.2307/1222391|The process of undertaking a taxonomic revision is central to taxonomy. However, no clear definition of or established methodology for undertaking a revision exists. Current attempts to apply contemporary computer technology throughout taxonomy can only be successful when the process itself is clarified. The subject of taxonomic revisions is introduced and a working definition is provided. The processes that are normally included in a revision are discussed and these are incorporated into a simple paradigm that models revision activities. Adherence to the paradigm will encourage researchers to adopt a logical methodology, which will lead to revision products being more complete and comparable.
10.2307/1222392|An emended description of Galinsoga boliviensis is provided based on data from recent collections from the vicinity of Sucre, Bolivia. The species is one of two in the genus known to be hexaploid (n = 24). The chromosome number of G. mandonii is reported as n = 16. An updated key to South American species of Galinsoga is given.
10.2307/1222393|The classifications of Bessey and Engler were compared using the Mantel and Lapointe-Legendre consensus tests. Even if real differences were noted in some of the dicta or principles underlying their systems, content of groups at the ordinal level was not statistically different. The main difference lies more in the hierarchical, topological structure of their classifications. Bessey's classification is less polytomous in the higher categories than Engler's. We hypothesize that Bessey was more concerned with the higher level, using a divisive approach to construct his classification, and Engler with the lower level, using an agglomerative or mixed approach. Our results show that Bessey's classification does not fully represent 'an expression of a theory of evolution'. Engler and Bessey appear to have used sequences of taxa to reflect their morphological progressions. The results of the numerical and historical analyses were in agreement. The former helped refining the results of the latter.
10.2307/1222394|Solanum berthaultii Hawkes and S. tarijense Hawkes have been recognized as distinct species by all authors since their description in 1944. Some authors have considered them as sister species, but more recently they have been treated as unrelated species belonging to separate superseries. Hypotheses of species boundaries and hybridization have been examined using principal components analysis, stepwise discriminant analysis, canonical discriminant analysis, and one-way analysis of variance. 25 morphological characters measured on four individuals from each of 84 living accessions from throughout their natural range were analysed. Extensive intra-accession, intraspecific, and interspecific variability have been found in many characters, including those previously given great taxonomic weight. 9 characters show no statistically significant differences between species or putative interspecific hybrids. The remaining 16 characters show statistically significant differences between species and putative hybrids, but show so much variability that repeatable identifications of some accessions would require the use of population samples. The data suggest the possibility that the two species should be treated as one. Other currently-recognized species within S. sect. Petota may need to be reevaluated for synonymy. The results also question the hypotheses of extensive hybridization, interpretation of series designations, and the phylogenetic interpretation of corolla shape at the superseries level in S. sect. Petota.
10.2307/1222395| Details of a method for preserving leaves for subsequent DNA analyses using a solution that is saturated (obviating precise field weighing of chemicals) with both NaCl and CTAB are presented. Since the dry ingredients are easy to obtain and transport, the method can be utilized even at very remote sites. Results from fresh versus preserved leaves of Podophyllum, Polyalthia (3 spp.), and Taraxacum demonstrate that DNA suitable for restriction fragment analysis can be obtained from leaves that have been stored in the solution for up to one month at ambient temperatures and then frozen for over one year at --20C (ultracold storage at --70C is not necessary). Degradation of DNA with this new method appears to be less for some taxa than with previously proposed DNA extraction methods using dried leaves. Analyses of DNA from leaves collected at remote rain forest sites are demonstrated. 
10.2307/1222396|On the basis of a study of meiosis, new chromosome counts are reported for 7 of the 68 species of the genus Pentaschistis. Two different basic chromosome numbers are present in the genus, i.e. 7 and 13. Polyploidy is frequently observed and B-chromosomes are present in some species, and existing data summarised. First chromosome numbers are reported for P. argentea (n = 21), P. aurea subsp. aurea (n = 7), P. capillaris (n = 7), P. curvifolia (n = 7), P. papillosa (n = 7), P. tortuosa (n = 7) and P. triseta (n = 7). Additionly two new ploidy levels, diploid and heptaploid, are described for P. eriostoma.
10.2307/1222397|A fossil seed cone of a conifer (Pinaceae) from the Pliocene of Germany, first described under Abies, subsequently under Keteleeria, and since 1958 frequently referred to the new genus Cathaya, is shown to belong to none of these genera. The combination C. loehrii does not appear to have been validly published.
10.2307/1222398|A general discussion is given of the background and work of the three Subcommittees comprising this Committee: 3A Lectotypification, 3B Retroactivity of Lectotypification and Illegitimacy, and 3C Lectotypification of Linnaean Generic Names.
10.2307/1222399|The definitions of the various categories of types in the "Code" are somewhat ambiguous, and have been interpreted in conflicting ways by different authors. In particular, problems have arisen where a single type collection cited in the protologue consists of a series of duplicates. When is lectotypification necessary? How should the term 'syntype' be interpreted? Amendments to the wording of the "Code" are suggested with the aim of achieving uniformity of practice.
10.2307/1222400|A neotype is proposed for Gleditsia podocarpa A. Braun, which is the basionym for Podocarpium podocarpum (A. Braun) Herendeen, a new combination that must replace Podogonium knorrii Heer, which is illegitimate.
10.2307/1222401| The type specimen of  Dupontopoa dezhnevii Prob. was examined. It is composed of 3 discordant elements, none of which would seem to be a hybrid resulting from the proposed parentage. The name is lectotypified on an element identified as Poa eminens. Taxonomic and nomenclatural implications of the observations are discussed. The synonymy for P. eminens is given. 
10.2307/1222402|Pertusaria aspergilla (Achar.) Laundon, comb. nov., replaces P. dealbata auct., non (Achar.) Crombie, and P. dealbescens auct., non Erichsen, a superfluous name.
10.2307/1222403|The synonymy of the South American climber Araujia sericifera Brot., which is widely naturalized in temperate and subtropical regions, is clarified. Plants of this species have been commonly referred to as A. sericofera (an incorrect orthographic variant) or as A. hortorum Fourn. Lectotypes are designated for A. sericifera Brot., A. hortorum Fourn. and Physianthus albens C. Martius.
10.2307/1222404|Tylophora splendida is a replacement name for T. grandiflora Ridley 1924, non R. Br. 1810.
10.2307/1222405|The previously designated lectotype of Stachytarpheta urticifolia Sims is not extant; a new lectotype, Sim's illustration, is designated instead.
10.2307/1222406|The recent lectotypification of Sideritis tragoriganum Lag. is superseded because the illustration chosen as type is in serious conflict with the protologue and another element is available which is not in conflict with the protologue.
10.2307/1223298|The lists of 'nomina conservanda' of mosses currently contain names of 52 genera and 6 families. Included as an appendix to the "International code of botanical nomenclature", the lists do not contain references to the original proposals or the Bryophyte Committee's deliberations. In the context of a historical overview of the subject, such references are here provided, since information included in past conservation proposals and Bryophyte Committee reports may be critical to the interpretation of previous proposals and the formulation of successful new ones.
10.2307/1223299|In view of the relevance of hierarchical organization and historical constrain for evolutionary theory, and of the lack of a suitable methodology to study these phenomena, attempts to simultaneously examine the ontogeny and phylogeny of a monophyletic group are thought to be promising. As an example, a multi-level study of the genus Abies is presented. First, the phylogenetic relationships for a subset of North American species of Abies are tentatively clarified through a cladistic study using data from existing treatments and combined outgroups. Second, intraspecific variation is analysed for most of the same fir species from continuous variables describing vegetative structures (from both immature and mature trees) and features of the cones. The results are presented in graphical form, allowing patterns of variable inter-correlations and their changes through ontogenetic time to be compared with phylogenetic patterns. The potential of such quantitative studies for the description of biological organization and further understanding of evolutionary phenomena is discussed in the light of recent theories of evolution.
10.2307/1223300|Published chromosome numbers in Sonneratia and Duabanga are inconsistent and indicate the basic numbers of the two genera are x = 9 or 11 and x = 12, respectively. Chromosome number counts made in this study for three species of Sonneratia indicate 2n = 24, and for two species of Duabanga, 2n = 48. The base is established as x = 12 in both genera. Although the genera have accumulated numerous autapomorphies that lead them to be regarded in separate subfamilies Sonneratioideae and Duabangoideae of the Lythraceae s.l., they share karyologically similar chromosomes and a unique basic number for the family, which is x = 8 in the remaining subfamilies Punicoideae and Lythroideae. Sonneratia and Duabanga are regarded as among the most primitive genera of the Lythraceae s.l. A number of other myrtalean higher taxa also have x = 12. This base number is most likely the ancestral number for the order.
10.2307/1223301|The reinstatement of the genus Xiphotheca Eckl. & Zeyh. (Fabaceae, tribe Liparieae) is proposed. A study of the morphology and alkaloids of the genus Priestleya DC. has shown remarkable differences between its two sections, P. sect. Priestleya and sect. Aneisothea DC. (= Xiphotheca). The latter differs in its geminate flowers, the non-intrusive calyx, the obtuse and pocketed keel petals, the uniform anthers, the shortly petiolate and pinnately veined leaves and the unique combination of alkaloids. A brief synopsis of the genus, including nomenclature, synonymy and typification, is presented.
10.2307/1223302|Descriptive data about taxa at one level of the taxonomic hierarchy may be inferred from representative data referable to another level. The process is bi-directional. Data agglomeration enables taxon characteristics to be derived from the characteristics of a subordinate level and data propagation enables taxon characteristics to be derived from the characteristics of a superior taxonomic level. This applies to any form of descriptive taxonomic data (e.g. morphological, cytological, distributional, uses, etc.) and at all levels of the taxonomic hierarchy. Examples taken from a revision for the production of DELTA format descriptions and distribution data are discussed. The major advantages of implementing these processes in a database system are: products and queries are based directly on representative data; they can be derived automatically from the data set without the necessary intervention of a taxonomist; less work is required to synthesize products or answer queries; there is greater guarantee of database integrity; data redundancy is reduced and thus storage space is conserved. The use of these processes should play a central part in any development of taxonomically intelligent database management systems.
10.2307/1223303|A versatile and relatively inexpensive PC mapping system in use at the National Herbarium of Canada is described and examples of its capabilities and use are given. Sources of place name databases with coordinates for Canada and the U.S.A. are also mentioned, and a simple method of creating color slides from the computer monitor is described.
10.2307/1223304|An earlier generic name, Shamovella, hitherto thought invalid, is found to be validly published. A needed new combination, Shamovella obscura, is made.
10.2307/1223305| Many studies on fossil woods did not respect the "International code of botanical nomenclature". As a result their nomenclature is complex and fluctuating. During preparation of a thesis on Jurassic fossil woods from Franche-Comt (northeastern France), problems have arisen with the nomenclature of gymnospermous woods with araucarioid cross-field pitting. This work is a nomenclatural review of the twenty-one generic names that have been used to designate mesozoic tracheidoxyls with araucarioid cross-fields. Only eight are legitimate and can be justifiably used. As a taxonomic summary, a generic key is proposed. 
10.2307/1223306|Vagaries regarding the origin and taxonomic relationship of the second true cypress described after Linnaeus's "Cupressus sempervirens" result in the current use of two to three binomials for what is beyond doubt a single species. By identification of the holotype of Miller's name and the evaluation of some historical facts concerning Miller's source trees, the correct botanical name for the Mexican cypress is established and its principal synonymy given.
10.2307/1223307| A reexamination of the nomenclature indicates that Juniperus monticola Martnez is the correct name for the Mexican alpine species and not Juniperus sabinoides (Kunth) Nees. 
10.2307/1223308|The name Aloe is a first declension feminine noun with the genitive singular formed by adding a terminal -s, hence Aloes. Since the generic name Aloe is of classical origin, the family name derived therefrom is formed by replacing the genitive singular inflection -es with the termination -aceae, hence Aloaceae. A number of correctable suprageneric names based on Aloe are discussed.
10.2307/1223309|Haworthia Duval (Asphodelaceae: Alooideae) is a taxonomically difficult genus under which c. 400 names have been published, most of them (excepting the most recent) not yet typified. Scott in his recent monograph of Haworthia attempted typification on a large scale, but of his four different ways of citing or indicating type specimens, two -- involving more than 50% of the accepted names -- do not constitute effective typification. The importance of making new typifications explicit in taxonomic studies is discussed.
10.2307/1223310| Historical and nomenclatural features are reported for two endemics from eastern Spain the names of which have been recently discussed. Erodium saxatile Pau [including E. valentinum (Lange) Greuter & Burdet] is revived for a taxon from Alicante Province, which was called Geranium saxatile but was never described by Cavanilles. E. celtibericum Pau is maintained for a taxon from Castelln Province, which was described but never named by Cavanilles. Both names are typified and their synonymies annotated. 
10.2307/1223311| The lectotype of Cardamine amara subsp. opicii is a specimen in the herbarium at the Botany Department, National Museum in Prhonice near Prague (PR), collected on Mt. Studnin hora in the Krkonoe Mts. by Ph. M. Opiz. The correct spelling of the epithet is "opicii", not "opizii" as used by many authors. 
10.2307/1223312| Physalis pruinosa L. displaces P. maxima Mill. for a Mexican and Central American species. P. grisea (Waterf.) M. Martnez, comb. et stat. nov., is the correct name for a North American plant that had been misnamed P. pruinosa. 
10.2307/1223313| Following the rejection of the spelling Jankaea versus Jancaea, a new spelling is given for the name of intergeneric hybrids. A new nothogeneric name, Coracaea Feuillet, is established, with a new combination, C. bluemelii (Halda) Feuillet. The case of the overlooked generic name Columnea Raf. is presented. The status of Aikinia Wall. vs. Aikinia R. Br. is discussed. Arctocalyx Fenzl and Gesnera Mart. are typified. 
10.2307/1223314| A new tribe, Platycodoneae, is described in Campanulaceae; it is equivalent to subtribe Platycodoninae Schnland. 
10.2307/1223315|The General Committee approves proposals recommended by Bryophyta Committee Report 1 (9) and Spermatophyta Committee Report 37 (12, including a confusability decision). One decision not to recommend is returned to the Spermatophyta Committee for reconsideration under new instructions.
10.2307/1223316|The Committee for Fungi and Lichens reports its recommendations on 15 proposals, one to amend the "Code" and 14 to conserve or reject names, recommending 10.
10.2307/1223317|The Committee for Pteridophyta reports its opinions on 12 proposals to conserve names, recommending one.
10.2307/1223318|Seven conservation proposals are withdrawn.
10.2307/1223319|The entries for Agarum and Zygnema in Appendix IIIA of the "Code" are to be corrected to show their earlier authors, places and dates of valid publication.
10.2307/1223140|The increasing size and activities of the human population have resulted in pressure on the survival of other life forms. In the face of extinction of many of these organisms, we need to learn as much about them as quickly as possible. One level of understanding can be achieved through monographic studies, which contain basic descriptive information about organisms and their distributions. Monographs also contain predictive classifications and usually also evolutionary and biogeographic hypotheses for use by systematic biologists and society in general. The current rate of disappearance of the world's biota suggests need for increased levels of creative monographic activity. Funding for botanical monography in the United States, however, is declining, and fewer graduate students are being trained with these interests and skills. Large-scale monographic projects with established workers and postdoctoral associates together focusing on large taxa (i.e., 50-100 species) are advocated as one solution to the problem.
10.2307/1223141|Festuca subg. Obtusae, a distinct group among Festuca in North America, contains two species: F. paradoxa Desv. and F. subverticillata (Pers.) E. B. Alexeev. The suggestion that the two may not be specifically distinct might be made because three characters traditionally used for separating them are more phenotypically plastic than previously recorded (inflorescence branch length, number of spikelets per branch, and spikelet width). However, where both species are sympatric they remain distinct. Evidence that they may occasionally hybridise is limited and inconclusive. An extensive statistical analysis has demonstrated that the shape of mature inflorescences, the arrangement of spikelets on inflorescence branches, the shape of the spikelets in bud, and often the length of the upper glume relative to the length of the first lemma, are characteristic of each species.
10.2307/1223142|The phylogenetic position of Wenchengia is considered in the light of new data on its pollen morphology and leaf epidermal anatomy. The pollen is tricolpate, tectate-perforate, supra-reticulate and has simple columellae. Leaves are hypostomatic, with mainly diacytic and diallelocytic stomata. Wenchengia appears to be most closely related to Ajuga, Cymaria, or Acrymia. A position close to Scutellaria, Tinnea, and Renschia is only slightly less parsimonious. Although Wenchengia was originally segregated as a monotypic subfamily, assignment to Ajugoideae or Scutellarioideae may be more consistent with a phylogenetic classification of the family.
10.2307/1223144|This paper evaluates the present size of plant collections and the number of botanists in the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, the region with the highest plant diversity in the world. Statistics reveal that collection density is adequate for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, while South America, with the exception of Chile and Argentina, is undercollected. Argentina hosts the highest number of botanists while all other countries appear to need more plant taxonomists to perform floristic inventories. The differences in absolute numbers of specimens and botanists between the three largest countries (Argentina, Brazil and Mexico) and the other countries in the area are remarkable, reflecting an unbalance in the development of local botanical science.
10.2307/1223145|A printed 14-page "Catalogue" that tabulates alphabetically 494 "vulgar" and scientific names of plants associated with the Charleston Botanick Garden has recently come to light. It complements the contemporary "Catalogue" of David Hosack's Elgin Botanic Garden of New York.
10.2307/1223146|A common misconception about the geographical position of the southern African type locality, "Be(ts)chuanaland", is clarified. It is shown that this regional name does not necessarily refer to the present-day Republic of Botswana, and that the type specimen of Haworthia tenuifolia Engl. was collected in what later became the Cape Province (formerly Cape Colony) of the Republic of South Africa.
10.2307/1223148|Three programs for digital (i.e. not requiring RGB video input) image analysis on IBM-PC compatible computers, and one on Macintosh computers, are discussed with regard to their use in morphometric applications. Measurement-TV provides a least-cost solution for IBM compatibles, though with reduced capabilities compared to other programs. The Image family of public domain programs provide excellent capabilities on high-end Macintoshes.
10.2307/1223149|Lectotypes are proposed for Linnaeus's names for European species belonging to Sedum subgen. Sedum, i.e. S. acre L., S. album L., S. annuum L., S. atratum L., S. caeruleum L., S. cepaea L., S. dasyphyllum L., S. hispanicum L., S. reflexum L., S. rubens L., S. rupestre L., S. stellatum L., S. villosum L., and for Tillaea rubra L., which is the basionym of S. rubrum (L.) Thell. For S. sexangulare L. a neotype is proposed which has been chosen from the material in the Linnaean herbarium in Stockholm. The typification of these names in all cases serves to maintain general usage. In particular, the typification of S. sexangulare, S. rubens, S. rupestre, and Tillaea rubra helps to settle disputes about the application of these names, guarantees their unambiguous use, and thus serves stability of nomenclature.
10.2307/1223150|Tetragonia horrida Britton, formerly placed in Aizoaceae, is a synonym of Sclerophylax spinescens Miers (Solanaceae/Sclerophylacaceae).
10.2307/1223151|The widespread and weedy eragrostoid grass currently known as Leptochloa filiformis is based on a later homonym. It should be called L. mucronata (Michx.) Kunth. A complete synonymy is provided.
10.2307/1223152|The taxonomic history of the controversial names Cactus opuntia and Opuntia vulgaris is discussed, the original elements associated with them are analysed, and the changing interpretation of the names by previous authors is reviewed. The consequences of the possible choices of a lectotype for nomenclatural stability are considered. Lectotypification of Cactus opuntia with material mentioned by previous authors would perpetuate the confusion surrounding this name and the homotypic Opuntia vulgaris based on it, as the latter name has been widely applied to two different species (O. humifusa and O. monacantha). Lectotypification of Cactus opuntia with another element involved, as here proposed, permits to sink the controversial names in the synonymy of Opuntia ficus-indica, thereby avoiding the necessity of proposals to formally reject them. The correct names for the two species formerly known as "O. vulgaris" are O. humifusa, and O. monacantha. A neotype is designated for O. humifusa.
10.2307/1223153|The General Commitee approves proposals recommended by the Fungi and Lichens Committee Report 2; reconfirms conservation of two names left out of the last "Code"; and reviews the status of eleven prior General Committee nonbinding decisions on confusability of similar names.
10.2307/1223154|Accounts for all botanical names proposed for conservation/rejection that were not acted upon by the XIV International Botanical Congress in 1987 (Berlin), and those proposed by the end of 1992.
10.2307/1223158|It is considered that the presently accepted type of Cactus, C. mammillaris, was an unsuitable choice, arbitrarily selected without due regard for the usage at the time of Linnaeus and for at least 150 years post-Linnaeus. It is proposed that the type of Cactus be Cactus melocactus Linnaeus (Melocactus communis). To achieve this, the family name Cactaceae, already conserved, must be listed with a different conserved type.
10.2307/1222531|The taxonomic importance of uninucleate vs. multinucleate vegetative cells in the Ceramiaceae is emphasized. It has been possible to make visible nuclei in old material, including type specimens, using aceto-carmine and aceto-iron-haematoxylin stains. The holotypes of Ceramium roseum and Callithamnion fasciculatum (currently known as Callithamnion roseum and Pleonosporium borreri var. fasciculatum) have uninucleate cells and belong to Aglaothamnion. In contrast, the holotype of Callithamnion decompositum, a name that has been applied to collections of at least two uninucleate taxa, has multinucleate cells; its morphological and cytological details agree with those of specimens collected in France and Ireland that were previously thought to represent an undescribed species. Female reproductive morphology (described from a thallus with gametangia in addition to tetrasporangia), in conjunction with habit and vegetative features, indicates that this species belongs to Compsothamnion (Compsothamnieae), as a third species, being distinguished from C. thuyoides and C. gracillimum by its sessile, lateral tetrasporangia. The required new combinations under Aglaothamnion and Compsothamnion are made.
10.2307/1222532| RAPD markers were used to assess the relationship among species, cultivars and hybrids of lilacs. Thirteen random primers were used to examine 87-130 bands per cultivar or hybrid. The percent band sharing among Syringa chinensis 'Alba', S. chinensis 'Saugeana', S. chinensis 'Red Rothomagensis' and S. persica, was surprisingly high (98.3% to 99.6%), supporting the theory that S. persica has the same species parentage as the three S. chinensis hybrids, but also indicating that all four are of different clonal origin since they do not share 100% of their bands. The percent band sharing among the hybrids and their putative parental species, S. vulgaris L. (3 selections) and S. protolaciniata P. S. Green & M. C. Chang (2 selections), were also determined. On average the first shared 48.9% of their bands with the hybrids, and the second shared 50.7%, thus strongly supporting the postulated parentage. Most bands found in the hybrids were shared with at least one of the selections, but 11 bands were found exclusively in all four hybrids. They might either represent genetic characteristics specific to these hybrids or might indicate that the exact parental selection combination has not yet been studied. The two studied selections of S. protolaciniata shared only 90,7% of their bands, thus confirming that they are of different provenances. It is felt that RAPD markers will be very useful for assessing the origin of cultivars and hybrids of many plant species. 
10.2307/1222533|Galloyl esters (gallo- and ellagitannins), which occur throughout the more primitive members of the Hamamelididae, Dilleniidae and Rosidae (the "HDR complex"), are important chemosystematic markers. Their significance is not limited to their strong protein-binding activity, as was formerly believed, or to their toxic properties, which have more recently been recognized. They also have powerful electron scavenging properties, thus inhibiting oxidation, a reaction that is fundamental in the synthesis of secondary metabolites. The HDR complex indeed is poor in shikimate-derived compounds; polyketide, mevalonate, and Krebs cycle-derived substances, which originate primarily by reactions such as condensation, esterification, and reduction, prevail but lack systematic continuity. The absence of coherent chemosystematic markers reflects the systematic isolation of the orders and superorders in the HDR complex, where phylogenetic relationships are less obvious than in the other dicotyledonous subclasses. Phytoalexins are mostly found in members of the HDR complex that are poor in galloyl esters. In view of their molecular properties (small, planar, highly conjugated molecules) it is suggested that they equally act as antioxidants. The superorders belonging to the subclasses Magnoliidae, Caryophyllidae, and Asteridae, which lack galloyl esters, are endowed with antioxidants of weak efficacy (proanthocyanidins and/or caffeic acid esters) and have a rich array of secondary metabolites, which permits the recognition of major evolutionary lines.
10.2307/1222534|44 taxa of Juniperus were analysed using RAPDs, similarity measures and principal coordinate analyses (PCO). The three sections of Juniperus (sect. Caryocedrus, sect. Juniperus, sect. Sabina) were found to be distinguished by RAPDs. The genus appears to be naturally divided into three major sections with two series (serrate and smooth leaf margins) in J. sect. Sabina. Additional examinations of specific and infraspecific taxa confirms earlier taxonomic work based on leaf terpenoids. Computer software (PCO3D from R.P.A.) for PCO is introduced for the analysis of RAPDs. RAPDs were found to be of taxonomic use ranging from sectional to varietal levels.
10.2307/1222535|Ernst Mayr has recently analysed the flora of Concord, Massachusetts, and concluded that over 90% of the native species of plants are well described by his "biological species concept", which defines species as interbreeding communities that are reproductively isolated from one another. However, many of the species he considers to be good "biological species" either show little or no outcrossing or else regularly exchange genes with other species. Mayr has assessed the species of Concord, not by the two reproductive properties in his definition, but by the properties in the traditional morpho-geographical species concept, that is, by the existence of discontinuities in the natural interpopulational variation of morphological or other markers. The flaws Mayr attributes to morphological species concepts -- that taxonomists assess variation in individuals without reference to the underlying population-genetic variation, that taxonomic species are based on overall phenetic distance rather than phenetic discontinuities, and that they grossly overestimate the frequency of natural hybridization in plants -- are not part of any modern species concept, and his refutations of critics of his concepts do not adequately address the problems that exist in his definition. He is quite correct in concluding that the nature of species is similar in animals and plants, since uniparental reproduction and interspecific gene exchange are also widespread in animals. To the extent that Mayr is defending the classical morpho-geographical approach to systematics, he is quite right, as most taxonomists have long recognized. The controversy over Mayr's biological species concept is due to his linking the morpho-geographical approach to an inaccurate definition.
10.2307/1222536|Phylogenetic species, the minimal elements appropriate as terminals in phylogenetic analysis, are population systems that are differentiated by unique (i.e., diagnostic) character combinations. Within the predominantly polyploid Puccinellia nuttalliana species complex, two diploid taxonomic species are recognized on the basis of morphology. Isozyme variation was analysed in 11 diploid populations identified as P. lemmonii and one identified as the rare P. parishii, and variation profiles were generated for each population, reflecting each allele as either absent, present and fixed, or present and not fixed. Population Aggregation Analysis (PAA) grouped these populations into two distinct isozyme species that correspond precisely in membership to the species recognized previously on the basis of morphology; thus, isozyme patterns are congruent with those of morphology. Mean genetic identities among populations of P. lemmonii are not unusually high for conspecific plant populations, nor are genetic identities between populations of the two species unusually low.
10.2307/1222537|Lectotypes are designated for the 13 binomials validly published by Sampaio in Rubus, based on the study of the original material in Sampaio's herbarium in Oporto (PO) and of duplicates present in Madrid (MA). Of the 13 named species of Rubus described by Sampaio, 5 (R. sampaioanus, R. vagabundus, R. peratticus, R. henriquesii and R. brigantinus) are considered autonomous (regional), while the rest appear to be merely local species.
10.2307/1222538|Severe criticisms are made of the present state of computer-assisted classification methods. The literature gives little clarity on which of many available computer methods is best, and serious problems have come to light in cladistics. Classifiers used to expect a high standard of help from computers but actual results now engender a growing crisis of confidence. Since well-made groups are crucial in all fields of study, ways of improving the resolving power of grouping methods are discussed. Evolutionary groups are often riddled with inconsistencies, making them polythetic. The Uniter computer program, just released, provides for this by clustering using homogeneity, which allows dilation due to contexts of external allies. Uniter puts the clusters it reveals into sequences, and evaluates the quality of each cluster, giving a guide to placing the boundaries of formal taxa. The program's interactive treatments for a variety of situations are outlined, including a new method for de-weighting coarsely coded properties with few states. It is concluded that these treatments are essential for high resolving power and programs that lack them should not be used for classifying evolutionary groups.
10.2307/1222539|The E-mail data server is a database system that delivers specimen data over the Internet within electronic mail. Using electronic mail as a vehicle for delivering queries and for returning data permits unlimited access to remote databases for any scientist with network mail service. This "open-access" approach contrasts with database systems which require pre-arranged accounts and passwords for access, and takes advantage of existing research data networks. Three specimen databases are available for queries: (1) type specimens of the Lamiaceae (and soon other families) in the Harvard University herbaria, (2) the complete catalog of Michigan State University's Kellogg Biological Station herbarium, and (3) the Flora of Mt. Kinabalu (Borneo) specimen database.
10.2307/1222542|The name Prochloron didemni, previously only effectively published, is here validly published. Valid publication of correlated names at the higher ranks is assessed under the provisions of both the Botanical and the Bacteriological "Code".
10.2307/1222543|Omission of the type citation in an earlier publication requires republication to validate the name of the genus Synchysidendron and of its constituent species, S. resinosum and S. dicentricum (Pennsylvanian lycopsids).
10.2307/1222544|The correct varietal name for the Corsican pine, occurring in Corsica, Sicily and Calabria, is P. nigra var. corsicana (Loudon) Hyl., based on P. laricio var. corsicana Loudon. The Corsican pine is often referred to as P. nigra var. maritima (Aiton) Melville, based on P. sylvestris var. maritima Aiton, but the type of the latter is conspecific with P. halepensis. The Corsican pine belongs to P. nigra subsp. salzmannii, the westernmost of the two subspecies of the variable P. nigra.

10.2307/1222547|Tavaresia Welw. is the correct name of the genus which has sometimes been recorded as Decabelone Decne.
10.2307/1222548|The overlooked combination Clerodendrum farinosum (Roxb.) Walp. is the correct name for C. venosum Wall. ex C. B. Clarke. C. farinosum is neotypified.
10.2307/1222549|It has been claimed that the name was validly published by Molina in 1776. A survey of Molina's publications shows that, although he mentioned the vernacular name "maglia", he did not use it as a species epithet under Solanum. Schlechtendal was the first, in 1841, to validly publish the name Solanum maglia.
10.2307/1222550|The combination Fernandoa ferdinandi should be attributed to K. Schumann, even though he published it as "Fernandia fernandi".
10.2307/1222551| Generic names ending in -osma, a transcription of Greek osm (smell), have been treated as of feminine gender except Onosma which had a neuter gender. It is proposed that for uniformity and simplicity Onosma should be treated as feminine. 
10.2307/1222552|Recommendations are made for amending entries for two already conserved names, one a moss and one a hepatic. Eleven published proposals to conserve and/or reject names were considered, eight are recommended and three are not. Of the eleven names, eight are mosses, two are hepatics and one is a spermatophyte.
10.2307/1222553|Recommendations are made on 26 published proposals to conserve and/or reject names and three unpublished requests for decisions on homonymy (confusability of similarly spelled names).
10.2307/1222554|The previous Committee deferred 36 proposals to conserve family names to the present Committee (1987-1993). Seven, based on orthographic variants, were deemed unnecessary and have been withdrawn. Of the remaining 29 proposals 19 are recommended and 10 are not.
10.2307/1223261|Questions involving the history and evolution of groups of taxa, such as those on biogeography and speciation, are among the most commonly asked in systematics. Usually the data necessary to answer these types of questions are believed to be available only from studies of individual monophyletic groups. However, some information on biogeography and speciation can be obtained from floristic studies under certain criteria, e.g., the use of natural areas, uniform descriptions, and detailed distribution information. If these criteria are not met, detailed questions about evolution are not appropriate. However, even when evolutionary questions can not be addressed directly, it is possible to use information contained in floras, such as the numbers of species in different groups or areas, to provide interesting comparative information on species richness and areas of endemism. However, numbers alone tell us little about the value of the area in terms of biological diversity or its history and they should not be used as the sole statistic in determining the "importance" of an area.
10.2307/1223262|A 1991 symposium at the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library, Los Angeles, held in part to explore 'the uses of botany' in the 18th century, left the audience with a mistaken, frivolous impression of the botany of the time. The present article seeks to present 18th-century botany as a serious science devoted to an understanding of plant structure, classification, and nomenclature and to the utilization of botanical products for the improvement of humankind. Examples of the thoughtful botanical endeavors of the time are taken from the activities of Linnaeus, Solander, Banks, and Goethe.
10.2307/1223263|The chromosome number of Viola pilosa was counted as 2n = 20. This number as well as other characteristics such as acaulescent stoloniferous habit, adaptations to myrmecochorous dispersal and slightly uncinate styles suggest close similarity of V. pilosa and its relatives to V. ser. Viola. On the other hand, they contrast in chromosome number, fruit characters and style morphology with other species traditionally placed in V. ser. Serpentes (W. Becker) Steenis. We thus propose that V. pilosa, including the type of V. ser. Serpentes, and its relatives be transferred to V. ser. Viola. A new name is given to what is left of Becker's "Serpentes group": V. ser. Australasiaticae Okamoto.
10.2307/1223264| Arbutus androsterilis, nothosp. nov., results from the hybridization between A. canariensis, a Canary Islands endemic, and A. unedo, a Mediterranean species locally naturalized in Tenerife. The name A. canariensis is typified. 
10.2307/1223265| The 19th century classification of Croton by Mller Argoviensis is highly artificial. A revised system that incorporates the sections proposed by Baillon and Grisebach is presented, with a key to the 40 sections recognized. For each section, types and synonymy are indicated, along with a description and list of representative species. Described as new are 2 sections (C. sect. Anadenocroton, sect. Corylocroton) and 3 subsections (C. subsect. Cuneati, subsect. Matourenses, subsect. Sampatik); 2 new sectional names (C. sect. Argyrocroton, sect. Luntia) represent changes in rank. 
10.2307/1223266|Automatically typified ordinal names of extant vascular plants, their authorships and places of valid publication are listed along with the corresponding family name and its automatic type. Nomenclature problems relating to suprafamilial ranks are discussed.
10.2307/1223267|A tabulation is provided of all known editions of Salm-Dyck's catalogues and smaller publications relating to succulent plants. All are rare and some were almost unknown prior to the sale of the author's library in 1992. Their relevance is assessed to nomenclature and to the introduction of new succulents in the first half of the nineteenth century in Germany.
10.2307/1223268|The monotypic genus Gamanthera, recently described, was based mainly on the characteristic of the fused stamens of the third, inner whorl. However, in Licaria the stamens of the third whorl are either entirely free, or partly connate or united into a staminal tube. The depicted flower of Gamanthera has a gynoecium outside the staminal whorls, but this is considered an abnormality. Gamanthera is therefore reduced to synonymy under Licaria and the necessary new combination is made.
10.2307/1223269|Erianthus giganteus, hitherto ascribed to either (Walter) Muhl. or (Walter) F. T. Hubb., should be attributed to (Walter) P. Beauv.
10.2307/1223270|All known suprageneric names within the Caryophyllaceae are listed.
10.2307/1223271|Recently Randia armata has been wrongly treated as an illegitimate name but is the correct designation for the spiny, larger-flowered Randia species that has been called Randia nitida (Kunth) DC.
10.2307/1223272|The Committee recommends acceptance of two of three proposals to conserve generic names of fossil plants. It also comments on proposals to amend the "Code" that affect the nomenclature of fossil plants.
10.2307/1223273|This report deals with twenty proposals/requests: 12 to conserve (7 recommended), 4 to amend current entries (all recommended), 2 to reject (none recommended), and 2 requests for homonymy decisions (both not homonyms).
10.2307/1223274|Conservation proposals are made for Arthrorhaphis, Catinaria, Haematomma, Icmadophila, Laurera, Polysporina, Sarcogyne, Scutula and Umbilicaria.
10.2307/1223455|Type material of Kallymenia nitophylloides J. Agardh from northern New South Wales was found to be taxonomically identical to plants collected recently at a number of sites further south in New South Wales and in Victoria. The new material has reproductive and vegetative features consistent with the genus Cryptonemia (Halymeniaceae). The combination Cryptonemia nitophylloides (J. Agardh) J. A. Lewis is therefore proposed. The holotype of Halymenia chondricola Sond. from Western Australia was found to belong in the genus Hymenocladia (Rhodymeniaceae). The species corresponds with that generally reported in southern Australia as Hymenocladia polymorpha (Harv.) J. Agardh and in New Zealand as Hymenocladia sanguinea (Harv.) Sparling. As the name Halymenia chondricola predates both of the Harvey basionyms, the binomial Hymenocladia chondricola (Sond.) J. A. Lewis is proposed. Lectotypes are designated for Rhodymenia polymorpha Harv. and the related yet distinct Calliblepharis conspersa Harv.
10.2307/1223456|New chromosome counts are reported for all eight species of Adansonia. The six Malagasy species and the Australian species have 2n = 88, whereas the single African species, A. digitata, has 2n = 160. We review published counts for the family as a whole and conclude that there have been many inaccurate counts but that 2n = 86-92 appears to be general. A. digitata, Rhodognaphalon brevicuspe and Eriotheca pubescens are inferred to be polyploids. The tribe Durioneae, with counts of 2n = 28 and 2n = 56, is distant from the remainder of the family, as also suggested by morphological, biogeographic and molecular data.
10.2307/1223457|The phylogenetic status of plant species has become a critical issue in systematic and evolutionary botany, due in part to the influence of Hennigian principles on organismal classification. This paper reviews various modes of speciation and their frequency in plants, and discusses predicted phylogenetic consequences of different modes of speciation. The classic model of allopatric speciation by subdivision will typically generate monophyletic daughter species, whereas most geographically local models of speciation (e.g., the founder effect model), will produce a paraphyletic progenitor and monophyletic derivative species. Due to the theoretical difficulty of transforming widespread population systems through gene flow or selection, allopatric speciation by subdivision is likely to be less frequent than geographically local models of speciation. Low levels of gene flow will also increase the time required for the progenitor species to achieve monophyly. Thus, many plant species are likely to be paraphyletic, and predictably a species classification based on the criterion of monophyly is unlikely to be an effective tool for describing and ordering biological diversity.
10.2307/1223458|The new tribe Moquinieae is established, and scanning electron micrographs of pollen are presented of Hoplophyllum of the Eremothamneae, Gundelia of the Gundelieae, and Pseudostifftia of the Moquinieae.
10.2307/1223459|A study of the growth-forms in Arenaria sect. Plinthine is presented, describing and interpreting two different, systematically relevant, patterns that are defined by the position of the innovation buds. The first, apparently the more evolved one, probably constitutes a good synapomorphy for the 7 taxa exhibiting it: innovation buds arise on short, vegetative lateral shoots arising below the starting point of the season's growth of the fertile axis. In the second case innovation buds arise in leaf-axils along the whole length of the season's growth of the flowering shoots, extending to well above the first nodes and up to the base of the inflorescence. Recognition of these two growth-forms helps to solve the old problem of the correct taxonomic placement of the population from Mont Ventoux (S. France), which must be included in A. aggregata not A. erinacea.
10.2307/1223460|Distributed, public domain databases (DPDD) offer solutions to many of the problems that hinder compilation of information on biodiversity. Existing DPDD projects on Internet, especially in molecular biology, provide relevant paradigms. The software tools necessary for world-wide retrieval of associated text and images are all freely available on Internet. Essential features of DPDDs include universal access, decentralized maintenance of component data sets, and the use of standard, tagged formats for entries. Desirable validation protocols include cross-checks for consistency, use of quality control tags and tracing data lineage back to specimens. These issues highlight a need for new conventions on nomenclature and for registering field keys and other secondary taxonomic indexes.
10.2307/1223461|Herbarium material can be used for studying certain functional reproductive traits, such as the plant's breeding system. A method is proposed by which pollen tubes can be traced in the pistil even in old dry specimens. By applying this method to species of the Polemoniaceae, microgametophytes could be scored in stigmas and styles and their mean numbers related to the specific known or putative breeding systems. Mean numbers of pollen tubes showed high correlation with the pollen-ovule ratios or the stigmatic pollen germination of the species involved. These numbers were significantly higher in predominant inbreeders than in predominant or facultative outbreeders. The method is thus suited for obtaining accessory biosystematic information from herbarial material.
10.2307/1223462|Two valid and legitimate generic names of Silurian fossil obligate tetrads, Tetrahedraletes and Nodospora, published by Strother & Traverse, are based on type specimens that now are recognized as representing a single genus. Burgess, the first to propose the synonymy formally, selected Tetrahedraletes as the generic name for the combined genus, and his choice, having priority, must be followed. Gray's call to abandon both generic names is misguided.
10.2307/1223463|The generic name Phyllobolus N. E. Br. was untypified since the name of the species given as type, P. pearsonii N. E. Br., was not validly published. The problem is discussed in the light of unpublished Brown manuscripts on the genus, and P. resurgens (Kensit) Schwantes, here lectotypified, is designated as type.
10.2307/1223464|Cardamine rivularis Schur is lectotypified by a specimen at Vienna (W) collected by Schur in Romania. C. matthioli Moretti is lectotypified (or neotypified) by a specimen at Florence (FI) collected by Moretti in Lombardy. The confusion concerning the latter's author and place of publication is resolved: bibliographical details and chronology of 5 publications in which the name appears, all of 1847, are discussed, showing that it was validly published on 18 Aug 1847 by Moretti.
10.2307/1223465|Euphorbia breonii Nois. is a superfluous renaming of E. milii Des Moul. E. milii var. breonii Ursch & Leandri is an invalidly published nomen nudum, excluding the type of its epithet-bringing synonym. The taxon known today as "E. milii var. breonii" is sufficiently close to E. milii var. hislopii (N. E. Br.) Ursch & Leandri to be regarded as a mere variant of it. A lectotype is designated for E. milii Des Moul.
10.2307/1223466|Kanis's earlier lectotypification of Gomphia Schreb. is superseded and a new lectotype, Ochna jabotapita L. (1762, non 1753), is designated. As a consequence, Gomphia becomes a synonym of Ouratea Aubl., making one new combination necessary, Campylospermum serratum (Gaertn.) Bittrich & M. C. E. Amaral.
10.2307/1223467|To maintain stability of the generic name for this characteristic Brazilian taxon, the original and correct type citation should be used. It is recommended that the type citation in Appendix IIIA of the "Code" be corrected to: "Piptolepis ericoides Sch. Bip., Jahresber. Pollichia 20/21: 383. 1863", lectotypified here.
10.2307/1223468|A historical review of the "Code" provisions concerning gender is given. Not all generic names ending in the letter "a" are feminine. Indeed, a majority of those ending in -ma are neuter. A general rule is that names ending with the same element have the same gender. Some guidelines are offered here and due consideration is given to generic names that break the pattern. Neither is it appropriate to blindly impose classical gender nor uncritically accept what the original author did. Major weight must be given to botanical usage. These principles have been applied to more than 1200 names appearing in the generic names in current use (NCU) list.
10.2307/1223469|This report deals with 32 proposals (30 numbered, 2 unnumbered and first published here): 17 to conserve (11 recommended), 8 to amend current entries (6 recommended), and 7 to reject (3 recommended, 4 to be reconsidered in the light of changes to the rules decided in Yokohama); and gives 10 Committee opinions: 9 on homonymy (4 positive, 3 negative, 1 undecided), 1 on validity (name not validly published), and 1 on correctability of spelling (correctable).
10.2307/1222875|Types of names of seven taxa described by Steudel in his Synopsis plantarum glumacearum from the Labrador collections of the Moravian missionary Albrecht were examined. Information compiled from the specimen labels as well as biographic and bibliographic sources suggest this material was collected at Hopedale between 1846 and 1848. Samples of the handwriting of Albrecht, Steudel, and possibly Hohenacker are presented. Reinterpretation of the types is provided and a lectotype of Calamagrostis hirtigluma is designated. Biographical information on C. G. Albrecht, as well as several poorly known Moravian missionaries, is presented.
10.2307/1222876|Botanists, both professional and amateur, can have a substantial impact on uncommon plant taxa through over-collecting, and in some cases this may result in extinction of uncommon taxa. This paper reviews examples of over-collecting, mainly from the New Zealand flora, and suggests five guidelines to reduce its impact: (1) to use photographs where possible, especially as a preliminary record, (2) not to collect whole plants unless there are more than 20 plants, or more than 5% of any one plant, (3) not to collect flowers or fruits if only a few present, (4) not to collect duplicates, and (5) to use seeds or cuttings for cultivation. Awareness of the effects of over-collection and adoption of these collecting guidelines should contribute significantly to the conservation of uncommon plants.
10.2307/1222877|Typifications are provided for the names of new taxa of Loranthaceae and Viscaceae published by C. F. P. von Martius and A. W. Eichler between 1829 and 1868, mostly from Latin America. Three new combinations (one in Dendrophthora, two in Phthirusa) are made.
10.2307/1222878|Tribal affiliations for all generic names in the Asclepiadaceae are given. Homotypic synonymy is pointed out.
10.2307/1222879|The need for international supplementary funding of both the physical infrastructure of systematic botany and current research in the countries that constituted the Soviet Union is pointed out. Without it, the necessary development of our knowledge of the plant biodiversity, and its importance for global ecology, of about 14% of the earth's land surface area cannot be ensured.
10.2307/1222881|The "Indices botanici" of Gaetano Lorenzo Monti were published before 1 May 1753 and, therefore, names appearing in it are not validly published.
10.2307/1222882|The class name Chlorophyceae, with Chlorococcum Menegh. as the type, is proposed as an equivalent of the earlier descriptive name Chlorophyceae Wille.
10.2307/1222883|The application of the name Asphodelus ramosus L. is established by typification on material in the Linnaean herbarium (LINN).
10.2307/1222884|Omphalina umbellifera should be typified, in accordance with Fries's concept of the name, by the Rudbeck illustration. This is achieved by using the only element known to have been available to Linnaeus when he first described the taxon he later named Agaricus umbelliferus.
10.2307/1222885|Amendment of the entry for a previously conserved generic name is recommended, along with 21 proposals to conserve generic names. A proposal to reject a generic name and two proposals to reject specific names are not recommended, while a proposal to conserve a specific name is deferred.
10.2307/1222886|The Committee for Fungi expresses its recommendations on 11 proposals to conserve or reject names, recommending 7.
10.2307/1222887|The Committee for Bryophyta considered and recommends one proposal, to conserve Riccia (Hepaticae) with a conserved type.
10.2307/1222888|This report deals with 26 proposals to conserve and/or reject. Eleven are recommended, 15 are not recommended, the latter including seven that will be reconsidered in the light of the Tokyo "Code".
10.2307/1222713|A review of the morphological and karyological data relevant to the problem of the generic distinctness of Disporum and Prosartes is presented. The chloroplast gene encoding rbcL for two species of each Disporum and Prosartes plus one of each Uvularia, Streptopus and Tricyrtis was sequenced. The data clearly separate two genera Prosartes (N. America) and Disporum (E. Asia) that were traditionally combined under the latter name. There is much more divergence between Disporum and Prosartes than between each pair of their component species, and considerably more than between Disporum and Uvularia or between Prosartes and Streptopus. The rbcL sequence data thus support the restoration of the genus Prosartes. A synonymic conspectus of Prosartes is given, and one new combination is proposed.
10.2307/1222714|A new species from E. Africa, Cibirhiza albersiana, is described, illustrated and analysed. A new tribe, Fockeeae is established to accommodate Cibirhiza and Fockea. Its position within the family Asclepiadaceae is discussed.
10.2307/1222715|The genera Arthropodium and Dichopogon (Asparagales: Anthericaceae) are considered to be closely related, if at all distinct. Limited evidence from previous cytological studies suggested a polyploid series within the complex where Arthropodium taxa have 2n = 22 chromosomes, intermediate species, 2n = 44, and Dichopogon taxa, 2n = 66. Examination of chromosomes in two thirds of the species in the Arthropodium--Dichopogon complex did not support that suggestion, as most of the species in both genera have a chromosome complement of 2n = 22. Evidence of polyploidy was found in D. strictus (2n = 22, 66), A. curvipes and D. preissii (2n = 44). The chromosomes are too small to provide useful information on chromosome morphology and C-band patterns. The lack of morphological features to delimit the two genera unequivocally, combined with the prevailing 2n = 22 karyotype across both, supports merging them under the name Arthropodium.
10.2307/1222716|A world-wide sample of 53 Eragrostis, 1 Diandrochloa and 2 Eragrostiella species was examined in terms of 442 newly recorded characters. These data were stored in the DELTA system and used for generating full natural language descriptions. A selection of morphological and anatomical characters (58 and 60, respectively) were analysed through a variety of phenetic and cladistic methods, revealing significant character correlations and intrageneric species relationships. The analyses are discussed in detail. A revised description of the genus Eragrostis is presented, and two subgenera are recognized, and fully described.
10.2307/1222717|The present chromosome number survey is based on the holdings of the National Clonal Germplasm Repository in Corvallis, which houses a world Mentha collection which includes most of the known taxa. The survey complements previously published counts and provides information about 73 accessions that are available to researchers. It includes chromosome counts for two accessions of M. australis, a previously uncounted Australian endemic, and accessions of M. japonica, M. diemenica, and M. cunninghamii, taxa with but one or a few published previous counts.
10.2307/1222718|ALLEV, an IBM-PC compatible program for easy, automatic and objective identification of yeasts, is presented. All tests are given equal weight. The program also permits to select or classify all or part of the reference species or registered strains, and to calculate similarity coefficients. For each operation a report file is created which can be visualized on screen or printed. The files are extensible, and data can be added, deleted or modified.
10.2307/1222722| The protologue of Echinopsis pygmaea R. E. Fr. is based on two elements belonging to two taxa. A lectotype is selected to maintain current usage of the name. Rebutia haagei Fri & Schelle is considered to be a synonym of E. pygmaea. 
10.2307/1222723|This report analyses and summarizes the results of votes by the Committee for Spermatophyta taken on the 194 proposals considered between the Berlin and Tokyo Congresses.
10.2307/1223542|In the treatment of Lobelioideae (Campanulaceae) for his Flora of the Hawaiian Islands, Hillebrand described 21 new species and 13 new varieties, and proposed 15 new combinations (all but one at specific rank) plus one avowed substitute name (also at specific rank). In addition, Wawra described two new species and one new variety on the basis of specimens received from Hillebrand, and Rock described two species and 13 varieties on the basis of specimens in Hillebrand's herbarium. Thirty-three lectotypes and two neotypes are designated for names that were inadequately typified. In each case, the typification effected supports current usage of the name in the literature.
10.2307/1223543|The generic delimitation of Liparia L. and Priestleya DC. (Fabaceae, tribe Liparieae) is reevaluated. Traditionally the shape and size of the carinal lobe of the calyx, the shape of the keel petals and the number of flowers per inflorescence were used as diagnostic characters. A study of morphological and alkaloid variation indicates that the two genera run much into one another. Differences in inflorescence and floral structure can be attributed to adaptations to different pollination strategies. The unique combination of major alkaloids occurring in both genera also suggests that they are congeneric. Priestleya is therefore placed into synonymy under Liparia. The nomenclature, synonymy and typification of the genus and the 14 species recognized are presented, and some necessary new combinations are made.
10.2307/1223544|An infrageneric classification of Drosera L. is proposed on the basis of morphological, anatomical, palynological and cytotaxonomical data. A new subgenus, D. subg. Regiae (monotypic, D. regia) is described. D. subg. Ptycnostigma and subg. Rorella are united with subg. Drosera. De Buhr's earlier treatment of D. subg. Ergaleium is adopted. A key to the subgenera and sections of Drosera is provided.
10.2307/1223545|The history of the genus Sanango and its classification are reviewed. A detailed description is given of its gross morphology, trichome and seed surface micromorphology. Data on germination, phenology and distribution in Ecuador and Peru are presented. The author concludes that characteristics of the inflorescence, trichomes, fruit morphology and seed surface anatomy as well as seed development are consistent with the inclusion of Sanango in the Gesneriaceae.
10.2307/1223546|A study of floral and vegetative anatomy of the woody, monotypic Amazonian genus Sanango was undertaken in an attempt to help clarify the relationships of the genus. Detailed descriptions of leaf, stem, nodal, wood, and floral anatomy are presented. Wood is characterized by a combination of solitary and grouped vessels with elements having few-barred scalariform perforation plates, imperforate tracheary elements with very reduced pit borders, exceptionally tall and broad heterocellular rays, and vasicentric axial parenchyma. Of special interest is the presence in Sanango of a very uncommon multilacunar nodal structure having split-lateral traces. Stems possess cortical vascular bundles. Leaf stomata are anisocytic and distributed in clusters on the undersurface of the lamina. Anatomical evidences suggest that Sanango is most closely related to the Scrophulariales, sharing many important features with the Gesneriaceae.
10.2307/1223547|A chemical investigation of Sanango racemosum for the systematically useful iridoids and verbascosides has been performed. No iridoids could be detected, but verbascosides were shown to be present by high performance liquid chromatography and by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the crude aqueous extract. Reversed phase chromatography provided two pure verbascosides, calceolarioside C and conandroside, as well as a new caffeic acid derivative which has been named sanangoside. The presence of verbascosides in Sanango, combined with the lack of iridoid glycosides, suggests affinity with the family Gesneriaceae. A closer chemical relationship with the Loganiaceae (Gentianales) is improbable.
10.2307/1223548|The investigations of a research team show clearly that Sanango racemosum is a member of the Gesneriaceae. Special emphasis is placed on the following features found in this odd species: the woody habit, the stomata grouped into "islands", the node with split-laterals, the solid siphonostele of the petiole, the pair-flowered cymes of the terminal inflorescence, the semi-inferior ovary position, the (axile)-parietal placentation, the oddly shaped nectary, and the presence of the chemical compounds conandroside and sanangoside. All of these are features found in the Gesneriaceae, and most of them are unknown in the rest of the Tubiflorae or Scrophulariales. Sanango may not look like a typical gesneriad at first glance, but it fits best into the Caribbean tribe Gesnerieae, as a companion for the genus Gesneria L. sensu lato.
10.2307/1223549|Two distinct species, differing mainly in tetrasporangial features, have been confused under the name Anotrichium tenue. In true A. tenue the tetrasporangia are borne terminally on a small number (5-8) of whorled pedicels. In the other, A. secundum, comb. nov., the tetraporangia are borne subterminally and adaxially on a relatively large number (8-50) of whorled pedicels.
10.2307/1223550|Endosteira was originally described as a genus of the Tiliaceae. The name of its sole species, E. oppositifolia, is here neotypified and becomes a synonym of Cassipourea guianensis Aubl. (Rhizophoraceae).
10.2307/1223551| The previously lectotype designation for Asplenium lucidum Burm. f. is here superseded by designation of a new lectotype specimen kept at the Conservatoire et Jardin botaniques de Genve (G). A. lucidum thus becomes synonymous with the earlier A. adiantum-nigrum L. 
10.2307/1222672|Cladistics, a nowadays often computerized methodology for taxonomic research, is claimed by its proponents to be more advanced and less subjective than traditional evolutionary systematics. It offers a convenient method of combining factual character state distribution with assumptions on directions of evolutionary change, and of constructing hypothetic evolutionary trees. But its usefulness in taxonomic botany is hampered by difficulties in outgroup selection, frequency of parallelisms and reversals, and wide variation within taxa. Prudently used, cladistics may certainly be a useful tool to botanical taxonomists, but if pursued as an independent computer game it may be harmful to taxonomy and to biology as a whole.
10.2307/1222673|A cladistic analysis of 40 morphological, fruit anatomical, and chromosomal characters in the five species of Lapsana and eleven other species of the Lactuceae (Crepidinae) shows that Lapsana is polyphyletic. The genus is redefined to include only the European to S. W. Asian Lapsana communis and its allied taxa usually treated as subspecies. The four E. Asian species formerly placed in Lapsana are transferred to a new genus, Lapsanastrum, and the new combinations L. apogonoides, L. humile, L. takasei, and L. uncinatum are made.
10.2307/1222674|Diagnostic features of the Indian cycads are discussed, and a key is presented to the cycads of the Indian region. Cycas circinalis is shown to be an Indian endemic species, with two varieties.
10.2307/1222675|Terms used for describing the apical regions of the lemma of the Stipeae have been used inconsistently in the past. Those terms are listed and defined, and recommendations made for consistent usage where either more than one term has been used for the same structure or the same term has been used for more than one structure. Nassella is accepted as a segregate genus of Stipa but S. caudata and S. brachychaeta, two species confused in the past, are excluded from Nassella and are best placed in Achnatherum.
10.2307/1222676|The Permian genus Russellites, first described from Texas, U.S.A., is now known from several localities in China. However, Yuania, the name of a dissimilar Chinese plant, has been misapplied consistently to the Chinese Russellites, thereby obscuring an important palaeo-floristic link between North America and Asia. The taxonomic independence of the two genera is emphasized, and the appropriate nomenclatural adjustments are made.
10.2307/1222677|Representatives of Arthrocnemum, Salicornia and Sarcocornia were analysed using RAPD. The methods used were optimized by testing different conditions of the parameters. The genetic characterization of the mentioned taxa proved possible, demonstrating the usefulness of RAPD techniques to determine generic limits in the Salicornieae.
10.2307/1222678|Amansia glomerata C. Agardh had been reported from widespread localities in the Indo-Pacific region, including Africa's east coast. Numerous plants from the Hawaiian Islands, from where the species, including the lectotype specimen, was originally described, were found to have pseudopericentral cells, a characteristic of the recently described genus Melanamansia. Transfer of this species to that genus is made. The specimens from the Natal coast of South Africa, previously identified as A. glomerata, do not have pseudopericentral cells and belong in the genus Amansia. They are correctly named A. rhodantha, a species first described from Mauritius and previously merged with A. glomerata. The two species closely resemble one another in several superficial characters, but are generically distinct owing to their basic anatomical differences.
10.2307/1222679| A procedure by which subsets of variables can be selected and their relative importance assessed in canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) is discussed. It is apparent from a review of the literature that only the standardized coefficients can be used for this purpose. However, an example relative to morphological variation of chives (Allium schnoprasum L.) in eastern North America indicates that it would be hazardous, at least with small sample size, to select variables by the magnitude of their standardized coefficients alone, considering their exceeding instability when different sets of observations are included in the analysis. We argue that selection of variables, to be conducted with confidence, should be based upon t-values associated with jackknife standardized coefficients. 
10.2307/1222680|Levels of homoplasy, measured by consistency index (CI) or retention index (RI), have been commonly used as indicators of reliability of parsimonious cladograms. Less attention has been paid to distribution of homoplasy which, however, may be another important parameter for estimating the reliability of cladograms. Average unit character consistency (AUCC), measuring distribution of homoplasy among the characters on parsimonious cladograms, is defined as the average of total unit character consistencies. When cladograms with the same CI are compared, the one with the largest AUCC also has the most asymmetric distribution of homoplasy, i.e., it is compatible with the largest portion of the characters, and homoplasy is concentrated in the smallest portion of cladistically unreliable or fast evolved characters of this cladogram. Homoplasy distribution index (HDI) is defined as the difference between the AUCC and CI, and can be used to compare distribution of homoplasy among cladograms with similar levels of homoplasy. A new measurement of the reliability of parsimonious cladograms, homoplasy distribution ratio (HDR), is defined as the ratio of the HDI to the homoplasy index (HI).
10.2307/1222683|Erigeron glabratus Hoppe & Hornsch. ex Bluff & Fingerh. is neotypified on a 1990 collection by Huber & Fotsch 12220 (ZT [now at Z]).
10.2307/1222684|A specimen from the Burser Herbarium is selected as the lectotype of Achillea cretica L. on the basis of literature and herbarium studies. As historical background, treatments of this species in pre-Linnaean literature and herbaria are briefly discussed.
10.2307/1222439|The systematics of cultivated plants need to be divorced from a number of confusing ties with the systematics of plants found in nature. These ties have been developed in time because systematic groups of cultivated plants have often been looked upon as proper taxa and treated accordingly in classifications and nomenclature. It is shown that cultivated plants and their special purpose taxonomy are part of a different context (human society) than the context of taxonomy of plants in nature (evolution). A general concept of systematic groups of cultivated plants, termed "culton", is here proposed to end this confusion. The most important ranks of culta, viz. the cultivar and the cultivar group, are discussed and their definitions purified from imprecise elements. It is shown that the culton/taxon confusion has led to systematic/taxonomic misnomers and a far too complicated nomenclature for cultivated plants.
10.2307/1222440|Picramniaceae, a new rosid family, is established. A diagnosis and brief descriptions of the two genera (Picramnia and Alvaradoa) constituting the family are provided. The Simaroubaceae are recircumscribed to include only members of the subfamily Simarouboideae, excluding Harrisonia but including Leitneria (Leitneriaceae).
10.2307/1222441|Electrophoretic seed protein patterns of 30 samples belonging to 20 species and four sections of Trifolium, treated by numerical analysis, as well as karyotype data for the same samples, are discussed in the light of current sectional and subsectional delimitation. The grouping of taxa in T. sect. Mistyllus and sect. Vesicaria, both with a basic chromosome number of x = 8, agree with their previous sectional delimitation based on morphological characters, and with chromosomal features such as karyotype symmetry. In T. sect. Trifolium five samples representing four species (three with x = 7) were grouped together, whereas T. rubens (x = 8) of the same section was found most similar to some species of T. sect. Lotoidea. In the latter section, the grouping of a number of species was anomalous as exemplified by the low levels of similarity between species of T. subsect. Platystylium, among which T. tembense showed closer affinity to the species in T. sect. Mistyllus. T. sect. Lotoidea appears as a heterogeneous group in which species relationship requires reconsideration.
10.2307/1222442|Typifications are provided for names referring to Cissus taxa, or published in Cissus, based on South American material. Four new combinations are proposed.
10.2307/1222443|The concept of a "potential taxon" as a name- and literature-related data area in botanical databases is introduced. A potential taxon is a name with taxon circumscription information attached to it by means of one or more literature references. As a compromise solution between linking information in database systems entirely to specimen data or only to accepted names, using potential taxa can effectively preserve information links without hindering rapid database input and information processing. It is suggested that a potential taxon be cited by its name, followed by the abbreviation "sec." (for secundum = according to) and at least one of the literature references used to define it.
10.2307/1222444|Generic names apparently ending in -anthema, such as Trianthema (Aizoaceae) and Dendranthema (Asteraceae), are neuter plural in Latin and are to be corrected to neuter singular -anthemum, thus Trianthemum and Dendranthemum.
10.2307/1222445|It is shown that the word "included" as used in the "Code" (Art. 9 Note 1) should not be taken to only mean "cited in the protologue". Such a restrictive interpretation might lead to the undesirable and destabilizing retypification of names where perfectly unambiguous but uncited plates exist, either unpublished or published prior to or together with the protologue. If such a plate is the only element used by the author of the validating description or diagnosis, it is the holotype, whether cited as such or not. If other elements (specimens) exist upon which the original description was based, the illustration is usually precluded from designation as the lectotype and a specimen is to be preferred, but if no specimen has survived, the illustration is the obligate lectotype.
10.2307/1223402|Classifications made by the powerful human grouping instinct are dilated (swollen out, enlarged) around any groups that are probably incomplete for some reason. For example, evidence may suggest that some taxa of a group may have been poorly sampled by collectors. Some small groups may be important remnants of major fossil taxa or may have undiscovered allies. Dilating classifications around such incomplete groups may raise them to higher, more appropriate ranks. Dilation control is rarely provided in computer programs. The Uniter program lets the user give more dilation around the smaller clusters. It does so more for the later-linking clusters, based on an assumption that these are more likely to have missing allies. For clusters of various sizes, the user can control their individual prominence or concealment. Methods are compared and discussed with examples. It is concluded that controlled dilation is essential for the high resolving power one expects to find in computer based classifications of evolutionary groups.
10.2307/1223403| Lightfootia L'Hr., validly published in January 1789, is illegitimate, being antedated by Lightfootia Sw. (June-July 1788), and is furthermore a later synonym of Wahlenbergia as presently circumscribed. Whereas the tropical African and Madagascan species formerly assigned to Lightfootia have already been named in Wahlenbergia, the 39 southern African species currently recognized have not. New combinations or substitute names are published here to rectify this situation. Two names, Campanula sect. Campanopsis R. Br. and Lightfootia macrostachys A. DC., are typified. 
10.2307/1223404|The genus Eremothamnus has been classified in several tribes, in recent times either in the Arctoteae or in a new tribe Eremothamneae; because of its isolated position within the family, it has also been left unclassified as to tribe. Chloroplast DNA restriction site data for Eremothamnus, suitable for comparison with similar data provided in the literature for other genera of the Asteraceae, and the rbcL gene sequence for Eremothamnus when compared with those of other Asteraceae, both indicate that Eremothamnus is related to the Arctoteae and may be classified in that tribe.
10.2307/1223405|In a cladistic analysis, phylogenetic lineages of the Mesozoic charophyte family Clavatoraceae have recently been interpreted as evolutionary species. However, a reappraisal of the Perimneste-Atopochara lineage shows the existence of several evolutionary divergences which in our opinion are incompatible with monophyly as postulated under the evolutionary species concept. The revolution of classification brought about by application of that concept causes confusion and error, and the transfer of validly named species to subspecific rank causes instability and detracts from their usefulness as stratigraphic markers. The species that we accept are listed in an overall classification of the Clavatoraceae. A new combination, Globator steinhauseri (G. maillardi subsp. steinhauseri Mojon) is proposed.
10.2307/1223406|Three subspecies of Marchantia polymorpha have been recently characterized by isozyme patterns, ecology and morphological characters. To confirm their taxonomic status and to better understand their relationships and genetic variability, a previous study on enzyme polymorphism was extended to additional colonies and enzymes. A parallel study was done with DNA markers derived from restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Results obtained with these different approaches (protein and DNA level) all support the taxonomic distinctness of the subspecies. Genetic similarity within subspecies was found to be high over wide geographic areas, and low among subspecies. The genetic divergence of the three subspecies may be taken to illustrate a case of speciation with adaptation to different ecological niches, and subsequent reproductive isolation. The hybrid origin of Marchantia polymorpha subsp. ruderalis, postulated in the past, is not supported by our data.
10.2307/1223407|Mauranthemum is published as an avowed substitute for Leucoglossum B. H. Wilcox & al. 1993, which is an illegitimate later homonym of Leucoglossum S. Imai 1942. New combinations for four species and one subspecies are proposed.
10.2307/1223408|The isolation of DNA from plants has been described by numerous authors, each contributing a different method to overcome the problems that arise when extracting DNA. There are at least three main contaminants associated with plant DNA that can cause considerable difficulties when conducting restriction enzyme analyses and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) experiments: polyphenolic compounds, polysaccharides, and RNA. The procedure described below alleviates the time and expense of CTAB (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) and caesium chloride methods by utilizing PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone) to bind the polyphenolic compounds, a high molar concentration of sodium chloride to inhibit co-precipitation of the polysaccharides and DNA, and an improved method for removing RNA by selective precipitation with lithium chloride. Isolated DNA was easily digested with restriction enzymes and amplified by the PCR from widely different plant species.
10.2307/1223411|The previously but not validly published name Stichosiphon mangle is validated by designation of a type.
10.2307/1223412|A lectotype is designated for Avena pratensis, based on a specimen preserved at S, maintaining the current use of this name. The identity of the specimens at LINN is discussed. For A. pubescens Huds. a neotype is proposed, collected at Hudson's type locality.
10.2307/1223413| Cimicifuga simplex (DC.) Wormsk. ex Turcz. is the correct author citation. Lectotypification on a sheet of Wormskjld's original material at Oslo supersedes an earlier neotypification. Lectotypes are also designated for three synonyms of C. simplex: C. foetida var. intermedia Regel, C. ussuriensis Oett. and C. taquetii H. Lv. 
10.2307/1223414|Crataegus columbiana Howell is here lectotypified on material that is an obvious match for C. douglasii Lindley, sensu lato, and therefore becomes a synonym of the latter. A phantom taxon commonly called C. columbiana must now be called C. piperi Britton.
10.2307/1223415|Designating an epitype for Vitellaria paradoxa solves the problem of application of names at subspecific level imposed by the holotype consisting solely of a seed.
10.2307/1223416|The Committee for Fungi reports action on 19 proposals to conserve or reject names, recommending 14.
10.2307/1223430|Steps taken towards an increasingly harmonized approach to the nomenclature of organisms in all groups since 1985 are identified. The key conclusions of an Exploratory Meeting on Harmonization held in 1994 are presented, along with the report of the first meeting of the Interim Commission on Bionomenclature held in 1995. The latter meeting made proposals on the harmonization of terms between the five existing "Codes", and also prepared a first draft "International code of bionomenclature" to deal with names published after (provisionally) 1 January 2000.
10.2307/1223495| Glaphyrosphaera Schiler & G. J. Wilson 1994 and G. glabra Schiler & G. J. Wilson 1994 are considered junior synonyms of, respectively, Wilsonisphaera Slimani 1994 and W. petila (Corradini) Slimani 1994. 
10.2307/1223496| The recent reinstatement of the genera Guillauminia and Lemeea (Aloinella Leme non Cardot) in the Aloaceae is discussed. It is concluded that both should remain in the synonymy of Aloe L. 
10.2307/1223497|The names Dracontium polyphyllum L. and D. asperum K. Koch have confused aroid taxonomists for more than two centuries, because they pertain to similar material from the same country (Surinam), and their typification is problematic. The previously designated lectotype of D. polyphyllum is ambiguous and cannot be identified to species level; an epitype is here designated. A neotype is designated for D. asperum. The concepts of the two species are elaborated.
10.2307/1223498|The relationships within the tribe Sileneae (Caryophyllaceae, Caryophylloideae) were deduced from nucleotide sequence variation in the nuclear ribosomal DNA. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions and the intervening 5.8S gene were sequenced for 76 ingroup and five outgroup taxa. The relationships were analysed more closely for 26 of these, with the addition of 822 aligned positions from the 28S gene. Drypis appears not to belong in Sileneae, and perhaps not even in Caryophylloideae. Agrostemma is sister group to the rest of the tribe. Eudianthe (Silene coeli-rosa and S. laeta) and Petrocoptis are clearly separated from the core Silene. Steris (Viscaria), Silene sect. Heliosperma, sect. Rupifraga, and sect. Compactae together form a strongly supported clade, as do Lychnis plus Uebelinia. Cucubalus, Melandrium, and Gastrolychnis are nested within a weakly supported "Silene". Polyschemone, previously often misplaced in Lychnis, is apparently closely related to Silene acaulis. Within the core Silene, three main groups can be identified, corresponding roughly to three of Rohrbach's (1869) five main generic subdivisions, S. subg. Behen, sect. Cincinnosilene, and sect. Botryosilene. Pleconax, Melandrium, Cucubalus, and Gastrolychnis nest within S. subg. Behen, but the monophyly of this group is weakly supported. Members of S. sect. Dichasiosilene are scattered over all three groups, indicating that dichasium is plesiomorphic within the group.
10.2307/1223499|Of a world total of c. 700 species of Silene, here widely defined to include Lychnis, Cucubalus, and other generic splits recognized by some authors, 119 are known to be present in Greece. They are grouped in 4 subgenera and 39 sections (some of them new). The sections are keyed out and briefly characterized (mainly on the basis of Greek taxa), and their correct nomenclature is established on the basis of full synonymies and type designations. In many cases the sectional limits remain provisional, and corresponding problems are highlighted. Phylogenetic patterns within the genus, here briefly discussed, are still largely unclear due to frequent character reversals and parallelism.
10.2307/1223500|Data from recent molecular studies demonstrate that the genus Cyphomandra is nested within Solanum. Recognition of Cyphomandra as a separate genus therefore is not tenable unless Solanum is broken up into smaller monophyletic units. All Cyphomandra species are transferred to Solanum, necessitating twelve new names and twelve new combinations.
10.2307/1223501|An article on botany, written by George A. W. Arnott and ultimately published in the seventh edition of the Encyclopaedia britannica in 1842, first appeared as a preprint a decade earlier, being effectively published on 9 Mar 1832. Arnott validly published numerous subfamily names, many of which are presently attributed to later authors.
10.2307/1223502|A specimen belonging to the Turkish Acer monspessulanum subsp. oksalianum Yalt. is designated as the neotype of the ambiguous name A. orientale L. The latter name has been applied to another eastern Mediterranean taxon which since 1967 has been known by the slightly later name A. sempervirens L. This action stabilizes this current usage.
10.2307/1223503|Vitex bombacifolia, a nomen nudum of Wallich, was later validly published by Walpers. It cannot be synonymized under the later V. helogiton K. Schum., as recently done by Munir. However, V. bombacifolia Wall. ex Walp. is in fact conspecific with V. glabrata R. Br. not with V. helogiton.
10.2307/1223504|Cimicifuga foetida, the type of the generic name Cimicifuga, is here lectotypified by a specimen in the Linnaean collections at Stockholm (S).
10.2307/1222581|A total of 339 taxa (327 species, five varieties, five subspecies) currently are recognized in the Americas, with the caveat that additional taxa exist that are unstudied and undescribed. Those species recognized are placed, when possible, in infrageneric categories. Known distributions are given for each taxon. Synonyms and names of uncertain application are listed.
10.2307/1222582|The subtribe Centaureinae is known for its remarkable aneuploidy, from n = 16 to n = 8. A new, even lower basic number is added to the series, n = 7 for Centaurea patula (sect. Ammocyanus). Correlations between the aneuploid series and morphology, biogeography and DNA-based phylogeny of the subtribe are suggested.
10.2307/1222583|The official date of publication of each Contribution is given, with author(s), title, and pagination. Special problems, due to inconsistencies in the sources of issue dates (hand-stamped in a few copies and published in the "Smithsonian year"), are discussed. The issue dates appearing in the "Smithsonian year" are reliable, except in recent years when the published date sometimes was incomplete.
10.2307/1222584|Herbarium collections have traditionally been used primarily by systematists, including monographers and writers of floras. It is suggested here that herbarium material has eclectic value for use by many non-traditional users, but only to the extent that care is taken by collectors and other researchers who benefit from collections. Suggestive examples relating to ecology, conservation biology, and systematics are presented (drawing on studies of distribution, plasticity, epiphylls, insect-plant associations, molecular phylogenetics, and population genetics) where herbarium material would have been more valuable if it had been collected with potential multiple uses in mind. It is also argued that the quality of specimens is in most cases more important than their quantity.
10.2307/1222585|Recent species definitions have placed emphasis on "diagnostic characters" rather than isolating mechanisms. Such characters can be informative about the evolutionary processes which lead to speciation in highly diversified plant groups, such as those found in the Cape floral region of South Africa. Rampant speciation in the Cape flora has often been attributed to heterogeneity of the physical environment, yet many large Cape genera show radiation in floral, rather than vegetative, characters, which suggests that adaptation to pollinators has played a major role in speciation. Selection for more efficient pollination systems in a pollinator-limited context, rather than isolating mechanisms, is suggested to be the primary driving force behind floral evolution in the Cape flora.
10.2307/1222586|Paeonia decomposita, which has been ignored or considered synonymous with P. suffruticosa, is shown to be an earlier name for P. szechuanica. A detailed description is provided of this beautiful woody peony only known from a small area in N. W. Sichuan, China.
10.2307/1222587|Most methods of morphometric and phylogenetic analysis do not permit the incorporation of both categorical and quantitative data. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) was used to produce ordination diagrams of strictly categorical data from a cladistic analysis, and mixed data from a morphometric study of hybridization. In both cases it proved preferable to standardize the data prior to DCA, because increased separation on ordination was found when larger scale ranges were used. A standardization is suggested, such that characters are scaled on a range from 1 to the total number of characters scored; this will produce more informative ordinations if large numbers of characters are scored. When used in conjunction with appropriate cladograms this phenetic technique may help reveal features such as homoplasy which are not readily apparent in cladograms, while the capability of DCA to combine both categorical and quantitative characters is especially useful in morphometric studies and in areas of evolutionary biology, e.g. chronistic studies of extinction events in morphospace.
10.2307/1222592|Original material of Agrostis elegans, Allium ericetorum, Anagallis crassifolia, Avena longifolia, Hibiscus roseus, Ornithopus estipulatus, Potamogeton variifolius, Silene annulata, S. bicolor, S. crassifolia and Sison verticillato-inundatum was examined and the names lectotypified. No original material was found for three other names validated by Thore.
10.2307/1222593|Geranium rotundifolium is designated as type of G. sect. Trygonium Dumort. and G. sylvaticum as type of G. sect. Batrachia Murray. Boissier's unranked names of subdivisions of genera are considered as basionyms of Reiche's sectional names.
10.2307/1222594|Thismia fumida is here lectotypified by a previously unpublished illustration (held at K) made by the original author.
10.2307/1222595| Lectotypes are designated for four Linnaean names for taxa belonging at present to the genera Jovibarba and Sempervivum: S. globiferum ( J. globifera), S. hirtum ( J. globifera subsp. hirta), S. arachnoideum, and S. montanum. In addition, epitypes are designated for S. arachnoideum and S. montanum as well as a lectotype for S. soboliferum Sims, a synonym of J. globifera. 
10.2307/1222596|Typification of four species names originally published under Lobelia is discussed, and lectotypes are designated. Two of the corresponding species are currently placed in Solenopsis and one in Hippobroma.
10.2307/1224660|On the basis of morphological and chemical data, the genus Vincetoxicum is recognized as separate from Cynanchum. Tylophora is identified as the closest relative of Vincetoxicum. In consequence, eleven new combinations in Vincetoxicum are proposed. The C. auriculatum group is recognized as C. sect. Rhodostegiella. Tylophoropsis must be included in Tylophora, which results in one new combination.
10.2307/1224661|The names Centaurea moschata L. and C. moschata var. amberboi L. are typified by illustrations published by Morison. The features distinguishing the two corresponding taxa, and also C. glauca Willd., are discussed.
10.2307/1224662|Qiongzhuea, when first published, was based on "Q. tumidinoda" as designated type. However, the latter name was not validly published because two different type specimens were cited therefore the generic name, and all specific names that were subsequently published under it, are not valildly published either. A new name for Q. tumidinoda was later validated by Ohrnberger under Chimonobambusa, C. tumidissinoda, whereas the generic name still needs to be validated. The terms and conditions are here met for validating the name Qiongzhuea, and all species names concerned, under the provisions of the Code.
10.2307/1224663|An information-theoretic view has been applied to biological classification to capture taxonomic concepts as taxonomic data entities and to develop a system for managing these concepts and the lineage relationships among them. In order to develop the data model, it has been necessary to apply explicit definitions to several taxonomic terms that generally have not been precisely defined and to coin and define several new terms and concepts. Methods are outlined for comparing interacting classifications and querying hierarchical taxonomic databases. A program/database system called HICLAS, which provides an X-Window interface to query classification data, is available on the Internet.
10.2307/1224664|Some of the effects of including outgroup taxa on the branching pattern of the ingroup taxa are revealed by an artificial example, and illustrated with a more complex natural example involving the grass genus Kengyilia. To reduce the total number of changes required by a branching pattern, parsimony may prefer to reduce the number of changes on temporally long phyletic lines to more distant outgroups while increasing changes on temporally short phyletic lines within the ingroup. This may have the effect of bringing the ancestors that define monophyletic groups within the ingroup down to the phyletic line to the outgroup, which converts them to paraphyletic groups. Thus the inclusion of outgroup taxa during parsimony may alter the branching pattern of the ingroup to destroy distinct monophyletic groups and instead create nested series of monophyletic groups, reminiscent of the chaining properties of some phenetic methods. If similarities between ingroup and outgroup are true homoplasies, then removal of these homoplasies will produce error. However, parsimony estimates of ingroup may produce bogus monophyletic groups because no account has been made of the ingroup's most recent common ancestor.
10.2307/1224665|The preparation of conventional pressed and dried herbarium specimens by using a commercial hair-drier and a bag of tightly woven, fire-resistant tissue is described. It has proved particularly useful for preparing specimens of succulent plants.
10.2307/1224673|Berger's book "Kakteen" is a constant source of nomenclatural uncertainty due to new combinations in genera that are obviously not accepted by the author. The arguments in favour of and against accepting Berger's combinations as validly published are discussed, and it is concluded that they are not. The key to the understanding of Berger's taxonomic concept is found in the introductory chapters where the author clearly expounded his intentions. Therefore A. W. Hill is to be cited as validating author of the names concerned.
10.2307/1224674|Lectotypes of Lycopsis arvensis L. and Anchusa officinalis L., which provide the types of the corresponding generic names, are designated.
10.2307/1224675|The Committee for Fungi reports its recommendations on 36 proposals to conserve or reject names, recommending 35.
10.2307/1224136|The family Themidaceae Salisb. is resurrected and recircumscribed. It consists of c. 10 genera of cormous plants principally from western N. America (British Columbia to northern Guatemala). These had been included in Alliaceae, as tribe Brodiaeeae (subfamily Allioideae), but recent molecular and anatomical studies indicate that the group merits familial status. Petronymphe is not a member of this group but rather belongs in Anthericaceae. Agapanthus is misplaced in Alliaceae and, despite its superior ovary, should be considered a member of Amaryllidaceae, as subfamily Agapanthoideae. Alliaceae, Amaryllidaceae, and Agapanthoideae are recircumscribed, and Tulbaghieae raised to subfamilial status.
10.2307/1224137|Terms are proposed to designate different subzones and regions within the paracladial zone of the inflorescence, in the Poaceae. In some taxa the inflorescence is composed of short paracladia only. In others the main axis bears short paracladia in the distal region and long paracladia in the proximal region, so that two subzones can be distinguished. In general the inflorescences of grasses lack bracts other than those belonging to the spikelets. In the Andropogoneae, however, some inflorescences have long paracladia that lack bracts and prophylls but others have long paracladia with well developed bracts and prophylls. The former are designated as "long paracladia without trophotagma", and the latter as "long paracladia with trophotagma".
10.2307/1224138|In situ morphological analysis of plants from the entire distribution area supports the assumption that Aloe candelabrum, by its reproductive and vegetative characters, falls well within the taxonomic concept of A. ferox. The identical chemical composition of leaf exudate with regard to secondary compounds (chromone and anthrone derivatives) supports this conclusion. Gene products at 23 enzyme-coding loci, analyzed by horizontal starch gel-electrophoresis, revealed no fixed allele differences between A. candelabrum and A. ferox. The differences on which the two species were previously separated can be explained as local variation within a single and widespread taxon. A. candelabrum should therefore be subsumed under A. ferox.
10.2307/1224139|Stamens from 20 species of the subfamily Barnadesioideae were examined with confocal scanning laser microscopy to determine some of the characteristics of the connective base epidermis. All species had autofluorescent cell walls. Wall autofluorescence was more intense in the abaxial connective epidermis than in the filament epidermis. In most species all autofluorescent cell walls were evenly thickened, but in several species of Barnadesia some either had spiral thickenings or were irregularly thickened, perhaps an adaptation for increased strength in longer filaments and anthers as part of a hummingbird pollination syndrome, a derived condition within the subfamily. In slightly less than half the species the connective base exhibited a more intense autofluorescence than any other region of the connective. The adaxial epidermis was autofluorescent in eight species. The occurrence of autofluorescent cells in both Calyceraceae and Barnadesioideae suggests this as a possible synapomorphy, but in the former the cells are tangentially elongate and irregular, rather than longitudinally elongate with rectangular outline.
10.2307/1224140|As a corollary to the recollection of Badusa palawanensis in its locus classicus in southern Palawan (Philippines), typification and taxonomic status of B. philippica are discussed. What has been considered a doubtful species of questionable Philippine origin becomes a straightforward synonym of B. corymbifera originating (as does the latter) from Tonga.
10.2307/1224141|The wild, red-flowered Phaseolus glabellus is generally considered either as a species of the P. coccineus complex or as a subspecies of P. coccineus. Biogeographic considerations as well as experimental hybridization, seed storage protein electrophoresis and cpDNA polymorphism point at its isolated taxonomic position and distinctness from P. coccineus. The position of P. glabellus in Phaseolus and its relationships with the remaining taxa of the P. coccineus complex are discussed.
10.2307/1224142|Standard taxonomic treatments are very well adapted to computerization. A method is presented for producing taxonomic treatments using standard commercial software (spreadsheets and word processors). The data from morphological descriptions and other elements of the treatments are stored in the spreadsheet with taxa as rows and characters as columns, and the descriptions are generated using a print merge routine, available in most word processors. Departures from parallelism necessitated by structural differences between taxa or by missing data are easily accommodated using conditional statements in the print merge. Examples are given to illustrate the approach. Treatments prepared in this way are easy to edit for parallelism and internal consistency, and format changes can be entered once for incorporation throughout the treatment. This approach can be used to produce taxonomic treatments in an easily editable form, or as a framework for developing a data structure for use in a database or specialized taxonomy program.
10.2307/1224143|Correspondence from the publisher shows that the actual publication date of Backeberg & Knuth's "Kaktus-ABC" is 12 Feb 1936, not 31 Dec 1935 as stated in the book.
10.2307/1224144|Lectotypes are designated for three Linnaean names: Echium capitatum, E. fruticosum, and E. laevigatum. Thereby the third becomes a synonym of the second.
10.2307/1224145|Dicoma bangueolensis, lectotypified here, is a common species of Somalia, not of Tanzania as fraudulently claimed by Muschler in the protologue.
10.2307/1224146|Phragmites is represented by two taxa on the S. Aegean island of Crete (Greece), one of which corresponds to the cosmopolitan common reed, P. australis. The other deviates in several features and is here described and named as a new species, P. frutescens H. Scholz; it has been studied in the wild and was found to have a peculiar, frutescent, branched habit, to produce inflorescences only occasionally, and never fertile flowers; reproduction appears to take place only vegetatively, by stolons and by leafy propagules replacing the flowers. The Cretan reed has been taxonomically equated by some authors with a doubtful Linnean species, Cenchrus frutescens, and the latter name has been recently proposed for rejection so as to prevent displacement of P. australis by the older supposed synonym. Although one of the original elements of C. frutescens arguably belongs to P. frutescens, it is an old illustration that cannot be interpreted with ultimate certainty; furthermore it is in major conflict with the remainder of the protologue. Choice of the epithet frutescens for the new species eliminates future uncertainty and makes the proposal to reject C. frutescens unnecessary. Those who (like one of the authors) are unconvinced of the specific distinctness of the Cretan reed are free to treat it at an appropriate infraspecific level under P. australis.
10.2307/1224245| Aucher-Eloy was the first to make a comprehensive collection of plants from northern Oman (then called the Immamat of Muscat). He collected mainly in the northern mountains and foothills during March and April 1838. These as well as his other collections from the Orient served as one of the main sources of information for Boissier's "Flora orientalis", still a standard reference work for the flora of south-west Asia. Aucher-Eloy's collection from Oman is listed here insofar as specimens have been located in the herbaria at Paris, Geneva, and Kew. Identifications of the 143 species thus listed are revised. Collecting locations and a complete itinerary are reconstructed with the help of Aucher-Eloy's published journal and his unpublished field note-book (at the Musum national d'Histoire naturelle, Paris). 
10.2307/1224246|The name Willemetia Neck. was validly published in 1777-1778 already, thus antedating Calycocorsus F. W. Schmidt 1791. Details of the publication are given, including probable dating. A generic description, a key to species and subspecies included in the genus and summary of their distributions, and full synonymy and typification at all ranks are given. A new combination, W. stipitata subsp. albanica, is proposed.
10.2307/1224247| Due to a misunderstanding new species of Monnina collected by Humboldt and Bonpland were described twice and under different generic names. In 1808 Bonpland described the genus Hebeandra to accomodate 16 new species collected by Humboldt and himself in Central and South America, ignoring the genus Monnina established by Ruiz and Pavn ten years before. Kunth, unaware of Bonpland's paper, republished the species in 1823, based on the same collections, but under Monnina. The epithets were partly those used by Bonpland, partly his own. This paper reviews the resulting nomenclatural chaos. Typification of the names involved is discussed, and lectotypes are designated when appropriate. Six traditionally accepted specific names will change unless conservation, proposed elsewhere, is granted. 
10.2307/1224248|According to recent molecular data, the Anomochloeae, Streptochaeteae, and Phareae represent the most basal lineages within the grass family. Two subfamilies, the Anomochlooideae and the Pharoideae, are resurrected and described here to accommodate these three tribes. The name Pharoideae is validated and amended from its previous circumscription.
10.2307/1224249|A simple method for objectively screening morphological variation in study sets suspected of containing hybrids is presented. The method applies to a collection of specimens in which two or more species along with some or all of their hybrids are suspected to be represented. The purpose of the method is to hypothesize which specimens might be of hybrid origin, and for each of these specimens to indicate which other two specimens resemble those that might have been its parents. The method is employed in the computer program HYWIN by using two kinds of computationally intense techniques: evaluation of a hybrid optimality score for each triplet generated from three quantitatively defined criteria: hybrid intermediacy (IN), parental distance (PD), and equality (EQ); and simulation of a probability hypothesis to generate measures of the level of statistical certainty. The method can be applied in direct studies of hybrids and their parents, taxonomic treatments, pinpointing of specimens that merit study with other techniques, and screening of data sets for putative hybrids and hybrid species prior to phylogenetic reconstruction.
10.2307/1224286|Although several revisions of Haworthia have been published, less than one third of the names have been typified. In this paper we list all names that will be accepted for species or infraspecific taxa in a forthcoming revision, with full references to their source and type data. Neo-, lecto- and/or epitypes are designated here for 47 previously untypified names.
10.2307/1224287|42 species transfers are made from Amaryllis to Hippeastrum in accord with the decision, at the Fourteenth International Botanical Congress in 1987, on the application of the former name to a South African genus. This completes the validation of combinations required in Hippeastrum, and will thus aid nomenclatural clarity and enable botanists and horticulturists to refer to these species by their correct names.
10.2307/1224288|Triplostegia comprises two species of perennial herbs from southeast Asia, T. glandulifera and T. grandiflora. The systematic position of the genus has been debated ever since it was described, and it has been placed in either Dipsacaceae or Valerianaceae, or in a family of its own Triplostegiaceae. Pollen of Triplostegia, investigated by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, is similar to that of both Dipsacaceae and Valerianaceae. Presence of numerous branched and bent columellae as well as an aperture margin structure resembling the halo found in Valerianaceae indicates a closer relationship to the Valerianaceae. A sister-group relationship between Triplostegia and the Valerianaceae is furthermore supported by other studies of molecular and morphological data. In order to maximize information content in the framework of mandatory classificational ranks, Triplostegia is best included in the family Valerianaceae, as the sole member of a subfamily Triplostegioideae.
10.2307/1224289| Post considered Dictyota adnata Zanardini to be a synonym of D. vieillardii Ktz. However, examination of the type specimen of D. vieillardii proves it does not belong to the genus Dictyota but represents the Vaughaniella stage of a Padina species. D. vieillardii var. filiformis Ktz. is also shown to represent a Vaughaniella stage. The type specimen of D. adnata could not be traced and the designation of a neotype by Coppejans is confirmed. 
10.2307/1224290|On the occasion of a taxonomic revision of western and central African herbarium material of Coffea, a new Lower Guinean species was discovered in the unnamed material. It is here described and named C. magnistipula. Several unusual features are discussed. The species is a monocaulous woody dwarf, such as one other Coffea species, the Upper Guinean C. humilis, but is peculiar in having adventitious roots on the stem and very large stipules which with the leaf-bases form debris-collecting cups. These adaptations presumably allow extra uptake of water and nutrients. As usual in Coffea, the calyx is reduced; in C. magnistipula, it is 'replaced' by a well developed bracteolar calyculus, resulting in a flower with a 'pseudo-superior' ovary. C. magnistipula has a distribution which is micro-disjunct; it occurs in three postulated Ice Age refuge areas of the tropical African rain forest, viz. the Crystal Mountains and the Chaillu Massif in Gabon and the South Cameroon Plateau.
10.2307/1224291|Computer image analysis was used to quantify the corolla shapes of Solanum species. Three approaches were applied, using global features, a selected number of points along the contour, and complete contour descriptions, the latter in three different variants. All permit quantification of corolla shape and are in fact generally applicable in taxonomy for studying two-dimensional shapes. All image analysis methods gave comparable variation patterns: the observed variation of corolla shapes is continuous, which does not support the subdivision of S. subsect. Potatoe into two superseries on the base of corolla shape alone. The studied accession of S. tarijense (S. superser. Stellata) could not be distinguished on corolla shape from that of S. berthaultii (S. superser. Rotata).
10.2307/1224292|Cladistic relationships among Gesneriaceae and related families are investigated using ndhF sequence data, to establish the affinity of three genera whose familial placement was uncertain on the basis of morphological evidence alone. A first analysis, including 18 outgroup species from the Buddlejaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Bignoniaceae, and Acanthaceae resulted in eleven most-parsimonious trees of 5740 steps each. Recent classifications had placed Cyrtandromoea in Scrophulariaceae or Gesneriaceae, Titanotrichum as a monogeneric tribe in Gesneriaceae, and Sanango in either Scrophulariaceae, Gesneriaceae, Loganiaceae, or Buddlejaceae. Sequence data from the chloroplast ndhF gene indicate that they are Gesneriaceae: Cyrtandromoea belongs to the Klugieae, the monogeneric Titanotricheae are perhaps sister to the remainder of the Cyrtandroideae, and Sanango is placed in the Gesnerieae as was predicted by recent morphological and chemical analyses.
10.2307/1224293|A phylogenetic tree can be subdivided according to a monophyletic hierarchical model, in which only monophyletic units figure, or according to a "Linnaean" hierarchical model in which both mono- and paraphyletic units occur. Most present-day phylogeneticists try to fit the monophyletic model within the set of nomenclatural conventions that fit the Linnaean model. However, the two models are intrinsically incongruent. The monophyletic model requires a system of classification of its own, at variance with currently accepted conventions. Since, however, the monophyletic model is unable to cope with reticulate evolutionary relationships, it is unsuited for the classification of nature. The Linnaean model is to be preferred. This renders the acceptance of paraphyletic supraspecific taxa inevitable.
10.2307/1224294|Names of subdivisions of the genus Taraxacum are listed and critically analysed. Validity and legitimacy are determined, all valid names are given types, and type specimens are selected and quoted where available. Comments are confined to the nomenclatural status of the names; for important taxonomic synonyms the accepted names are given, and names considered correct are highlighted.
10.2307/1224296|The name Acidosasa was proposed by Chu & Chao in 1979 for a new monospecific genus, with A. chinensis as type, but neither name was validly published because two "type" specimens were cited for A. chinensis. In 1991, the same authors designated a lectotype for A. chinensis. Mean-while, Keng in 1982 had fulfilled the requirements for valid publication by designating a single specimen as the type, which is the same as the later "lectotype". Thanks to Keng's early validation the nomenclatural repercussions of the original fault are minimal, with but a single species having to change its currently accepted name.
10.2307/1224297| The previously designated lectotype for Marcgravia rectiflora is superseded by a new lectotype specimen (Riedl 79, P!). Thereby, the recently published name M. brittoniana becomes an obligatory synonym and nomenclatural stability is maintained. 
10.2307/1224092|Understanding evolutionary responses of plants to desert environments depends upon phylogenetic knowledge of desert plants. The diverse American desert family Cactaceae has been presumed, on the basis of distinctiveness, to be phylogenetically isolated and relatively ancient (> 65 million years old). Using maximum likelihood and parsimony analyses of the rapidly evolving internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA), we show that the cacti are phylogenetically nested among other aridity-adapted lineages of the angiosperm family Portulacaceae. The ITS divergence between pereskioid cacti and the genus Talinum (Portulacaceae) is less than that between many Portulacaceae genera. Synthesis of the ITS data with morphological and chloroplast DNA evidence suggests an origin of cacti in mid-Tertiary, c. 30 million years ago, and a later Tertiary diversification coincident with development of the American desert. This, in turn, implies that the diversification rate in cacti was much higher than in their nearest relatives. The present results illustrate the central role of phylogenetic reconstruction in ecological and evolutionary theory.
10.2307/1224093|The tribe Asclepiadeae is divided into six subtribes, each of which is succinctly characterized and defined in terms of included genera. The inclusion of the Gonolobeae in the Asclepiadeae is formalized and subtribal rank is attributed to the group. A synonymic synopsis of genera accounts for all validly published generic names.
10.2307/1224094| Orthotrichum undulatum Hook. & Grev., based on mixed type material, is synonymized with Macromitrium incurvifolium (Hook. & Grev.) Schwgr. and is lectotypified by a specimen from W. J. Hooker's herbarium at BM. 
10.2307/1224095|The Sibthorpian Herbarium is a historical collection kept in the Fielding-Druce Herbarium, Oxford, comprising vascular and non-vascular plants formerly owned by J. Sibthorp. This paper deals with the c. 2700 specimens of vascular plants, most of which originate from modern Greece, Turkey, Cyprus, Italy, Bulgaria, and Rumania, having been collected by J. Sibthorp, J. Hawkins, their assistants and an anonymous apothecary in 1786-1798. Annotated in a fragmentary way, the Sibthorpian Herbarium comprises several hundred specimens that typify names validated in J. E. Smith's "Prodromus florae graecae". Recommendations for the interpretation of the entries into this work and guidelines for the use of the Sibthorpian Herbarium are presented.
10.2307/1224096| The new fern hybrid Colysis beddomei Manickam & Irudayaraj (Colysis decurrens  C. hemionitidea) is described and illustrated. It was first collected in south India by Beddome, before 1883, and was then assigned to Gymnopteris variabilis. The morphological variation of the hybrid is discussed on the basis of newly collected material from the same area and of herbarium specimens from Burma and China. 
10.2307/1224097|The generic limits of Sechium continue to be controversial. A phenetic analysis of the species of Sechium and its allies in subtribe Sicyinae, using both palynological and macromorphological characters, was carried out. The results of the analysis basically support the taxonomic circumscription of this genus proposed by Jeffrey (1978). Both cluster and ordination analyses showed that all the species recognized by Jeffrey as pertaining to the genus Sechium, as well as others more recently described, form a well defined group constituted by 11 species and clearly separated from other taxa in the subtribe Sicyinae. The observed clustering within Sechium does not correspond to the two sections of the genus recognized by Jeffrey. Sechiopsis appears to be the closest relative of Sechium.
10.2307/1224098|A comprehensive information model for the recording of taxonomic data from literature and other sources is presented, which was devised for the Global Plant Checklist database project of the International Organisation of Plant Information (IOPI). The model is based on an approach using hierarchical decomposition of data areas into atomic data elements and -- in parallel -- abstraction into an entity relationship model. It encompasses taxa of all ranks, nothotaxa and hybrid formulae, "unnamed taxa", cultivars, full synonymy, misapplied names, basionyms, nomenclatural data, and differing taxonomic concepts (potential taxa) as well as alternative taxonomies to any extent desired. The model was developed together with related models using a CASE (Computer Aided Software Engineering) tool. It can help designers of biological information systems to avoid the widely made error of over-simplification of taxonomic data and the resulting loss in data accuracy and quality.
10.2307/1224099|Carl Peter Thunberg's "Flora japonica" was published in August 1784, but most of Thunberg's new plant names were also published in Johan Andreas Murray's "Systema vegetabilium," ed. 14 which has priority by at least two months. Recent practice has been to cite these names as "Thunb. ex Murray". However, Art. 46.2 of the Tokyo Code requires that the authorship of these names be cited as "Thunb. in Murray" when a bibliographic citation is given or as just "Thunb." when the names are used without a bibliographic citation.
10.2307/1224100|The moss genus Campylium is heterogeneous. An early type designation by Pfeiffer had been overlooked. Arguments for and against possible conservation of the name with the traditional type, C. hispidulum, are assessed. In the light of new taxonomic evidence, adoption of the type designated by Pfeiffer, C. stellatum, is recommended. In this way, that well-known species name and the phytosociological designations based on it will remain unaltered, whereas C. hispidulum must be transferred to the genus Campylophyllum, which is closely related to some species of Hypnum.
10.2307/1224101|The Committee for Algae reports on six conservation proposals and one rejection proposal, concerning a family name, four generic names and two species names. All but one of the proposals are recommended.
10.2307/1224385|Types are cited for accepted names and synonyms published in Ampelocissus (4 species) and Cissus (20 species), and concerning Central American, N. American or Caribbean taxa. Several lectotypes, neotypes and epitypes are newly designated. Three new combinations (for one species and two subspecies) are proposed.
10.2307/1224386|A comparison of former supraspecific classifications is made and a new, revised system is proposed for Eleocharis (Cyperaceae). Four subgenera, seven sections, eight series, and seven subseries are recognized. A key to subgenera and sections is included along with type citations, synonymies, and representative species. Two new series, E. ser. Albidae and ser. Rostellatae, are described, along with one new combination, E. sect. Baeothryon, and two transfers in rank, E. subser. Acutae and E. subser. Sulcatae.
10.2307/1224387|Marathrum ricciiforme was originally described by Liebmann in 1847, based on scanty, sterile material collected in 1841 in Puebla, Mexico, where it is now extinct. On the basis of vegetative features, the species was later transferred to Podostemum (where it indeed belongs), with a second (misidentified) sterile specimen from Costa Rica added. Fertile material was first collected in 1988, and subsequently in several other Mexican localities. The species is here fully described, illustrated, and mapped, and an epitype is designated for its name.
10.2307/1224388|Lectotypes, neotypes and epitypes are designated by 31 specialists for 213 previously untypified Linnaean plant names (including one by the younger Linnaeus) belonging to the family Leguminosae (Fabaceae). These newly proposed types support the current usage of the names concerned. Earlier but ineffective or supersedable type statements are discussed.
10.2307/1224389|In the frame of a project of the OPTIMA Commission for Lichens, a workspace has been created on the Internet for the compilation of a checklist of Mediterranean lichens. The World Wide Web now offers quick access to the lichen checklists of several countries, and facilitates the coordination of future work through a common format of data presentation. As a first step, the checklists were placed on the Web as plain text files, except for the lichen data from Slovenia, which are organized in a relational database. Placing new information on the Web is equivalent to a kind of publication, which raises some issues which need being discussed.
10.2307/1224390|A review of the discovery and early descriptions of Sarcobatus as well as of its taxonomic history is presented. Studies of the form and size of sieve-element plastids in the order Caryophyllales reveal significant differences between Sarcobatus (so far in Chenopodiaceae) and the majority of the Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae clade (i.e., suborder Chenopodiineae). The presence of P3cf-form sieve-element plastids and concomitant absence of chenopod-specific P3f-form plastids reinforce other evidence, in particular from chloroplast DNA sequencing, to make appear Sarcobatus quite distinct from the Chenopodiineae clade and suggest that its proper place is in the vicinity of the Phytolaccaceae and Nyctaginaceae. Therefore, Sarcobatus is segregated as a new family, Sarcobataceae.
10.2307/1224391|Decay analysis provides an alternative, or supplement, to bootstrap analysis for obtaining estimates of the reliability of groups resulting from a phylogenetic analysis. This approach, which consists of examining trees longer than the shortest and noting the tree lengths at which groups of interest are no longer monophyletic, is used increasingly. One serious shortcoming of decay analysis as often implemented is that the number of trees that need to be saved and examined can be much larger than the capacities of hardware and software that have been available. A data matrix was constructed so that all trees up to five steps longer than the shortest could be saved and examined. A series of decay analyses was then conducted with this data set to determine the effects produced in the results when all trees are not found and to evaluate methods that could be used to conduct decay analyses of large data sets. Limiting the number of trees to be saved resulted in overestimates of support for monophyletic groups, a problem that became substantial when only 33% of all trees were examined. Two methods of decay analysis that use constraint trees to save a subset of all trees were evaluated. Decay index values resulting from both methods were identical to those obtained from examination of all trees, indicating that these approaches should be useful in conducting decay analyses of large data sets.
10.2307/1224399|The original material of Melissa grandiflora L. consists of two specimens and two illustrations. A specimen in the Linnaean Herbarium (LINN) is designated as lectotype.
10.2307/1224471|Introduces three papers presented at a symposium on "Botanical Libraries and Herbaria" held 21 May 1993 at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, U.S.A. The main focus of the symposium was to explore the relationship between botanical libraries and herbaria, and to emphasize the dependence of the latter on the former. The symposium also provided an opportunity to formally dedicate the Rudolph Memorial Reading Room and Rare Book Room within The Ohio State University Herbarium (OS) Library.
10.2307/1224472|Emanuel D. Rudolph, professor of botany at the Ohio State University and his wife, Ann Waterman Rudolph, developed a large personal natural history library totalling more than 53,000 volumes. Their entire library was willed to the Ohio State University, with approximately 11,000 botanical volumes donated to the Herbarium Library. These books mostly represent subjects in biogeography, biography, cryptogamic botany (especially lichenology), economic botany, general botany, and history of botany. Prominent authors are Acharius, Amos Eaton, Almira Lincoln Phelps, Lindley, Linnaeus, Ray, Schleiden, and Alphonso Wood. Holdings extend back to the 16th century.
10.2307/1224473|Men of great vision and wealth built Harvard's botanical institutions. Their combined legacies to the botanical community include the five Harvard herbaria and libraries. The botany libraries staff is committed to providing access to the collections by improving bibliographic control and preservation techniques, and by adapting new technologies to serve users' needs.
10.2307/1224474|Samuel Botsford Buckley (1809-1884) amassed a herbarium of approximately 6000 specimens through his own labours and through exchange with other botanists, mostly American but also European. This herbarium was acquired by Rebecca Mann Dean (1821-1890), a professor of natural history and other subjects at Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio, and wife of a bookstore owner who had a brief row with Buckley in the 1850s. Before her death, she sold Buckley's herbarium to Washington University, St Louis, Missouri. Within a few years of the sale, the herbarium was combined with that of the Missouri Botanical Garden. Neither the botanical activities of Buckley, which are fairly well understood, nor the nature of the transaction conveying the herbarium from Buckley to Dean, which is still problematic, could have been sketched without information contained in correspondence saved by botanical libraries and other scholarly institutions. The importance of keeping botanical libraries and archives in close proximity to herbaria is reaffirmed by this case study.
10.2307/1224475|Two frontier botanists, John Leonard Riddell and William Starling Sullivant, treated the vascular flora of Franklin County, Ohio, U.S.A., creditably despite the scarcity of proper books and the lack of opportunity to consult herbaria. Their vascular plant catalogues document the first species (and their habitats) discovered in this central Ohio county, now the site of the state capital. A list is presented of 24 vascular plant taxa first named and described from Franklin County.
10.2307/1224476|The diagnostic features used to delimit genera are enumerated and critically analysed. Floral characteristics are important: shape and depth of the corolla tube, and positions of outer corona, stamens, and gynostegium. Coronal structure is valuable but can be misleading. Vegetative features are sometimes consistent within genera and may serve as a complement to floral characteristics. The Periplocoideae are, for the first time, subdivided: three tribes are recognized, two of them newly described and named, and the individual genera and generic synonyms are mentioned for each. Some nomenclatural new combinations, required as a consequence of newly proposed synonyms, are validated in the genera Camptocarpus (4), Cryptolepis (4), Decalepis (2), and Pentopetia (2).
10.2307/1224482|Latin should remain mandatory for describing new taxa. The optional use of English under the proposed BioCode is unacceptable. Whereas the English language is the expression of certain living cultures, a certain political and economic system, Latin belongs to no single nation and yet it belongs to all. Latin is a patrimony of humanity.
10.2307/1224483|In response to the plea by Filgueiras that Latin diagnoses remain mandatory for the establishment of names of new taxa, and to his protest against the use of English as an alternative to Latin, foreseen in the Draft BioCode, the role of these two languages in biotaxonomic descriptions is discussed. It is pointed out that the origin of the existing requirement for Latin diagnoses of new taxa under the botanical Code is based not on Latin being a neutral language, or a simple language, but on the fact that it was the language of scholarship in the 18th century, at the point of origin of modern biological nomenclature. Likewise the suggestion that a BioCode should permit English diagnoses is not a matter of linguistic chauvinism but a simple reflection of the reality that English is the dominant language of science as we enter the 21st century.
10.2307/1224484|Lectotypes are designated for Scorzonera hirsuta, S. purpurea, S. tomentosa, Leontodon lanatus [currently S. lanata], and Geropogon hirsutus.
10.2307/1224485|A flawed lectotype designation for Doronicum carpetanum, published in "Taxon" in 1991, is antedated by four years by a flawless one.
10.2307/1224016|The family Muntingiaceae, here described, includes the Neotropical, monotypic genera Muntingia and Dicraspidia, and probably Neotessmannia, which have previously been included in Elaeocarpaceae, Tiliaceae, or Flacourtiaceae. Morphological data discussed here and molecular data published elsewhere indicate that none of these families can be regarded as closely related to these genera. Muntingiaceae belong to a clade that comprises core Malvales (Sterculiaceae, Tiliaceae, Bombacaceae, and Malvaceae) and several other families. Within this alliance, relationships are presently unresolved.
10.2307/1224017|Diegodendron humbertii Capuron (Diegodendraceae Capuron) is endemic to Madagascar. The family is monospecific, and whereas various affinities have been suggested, its phylogenetic position has remained unclear. Analysis of rbcL sequence data indicates a close relationship to Bixa. Together these taxa form a monophyletic group with a somewhat more distant relationship to other groups of Malvales s.l. including Cochlospermaceae. Cochlospermaceae (Cochlospermum and Amoreuxia) should be maintained as a family distinct from Bixaceae but if Bixaceae are expanded to include Cochlospermaceae they should also include Diegodendron. DNA extraction from herbarium specimens, involving modifications to the standard extraction and amplification techniques, is described.
10.2307/1224018|The identity of two orchid taxa described from Mexico as Corallorhiza punctata and C. bulbosa is discussed in the light of original material located at W, and not at P as would be expected. It is concluded that C. punctata falls within the older C. wisteriana and should be treated as a synonym, whereas, C. bulbosa deserves specific recognition, being distinguished from the similar C. maculata by the much smaller mentum which is non-decurrent on the ovary, and the numerous, minute spots on the lip.
10.2307/1224019|The generic distinctness of Amphithalea and Coelidium (Fabaceae) is reappraised. The fusion of the stamens, diadelphous in Amphithalea and monadelphous in Coelidium, has been used as the only character to differentiate between the two genera. A cladistic analysis of 16 morphological and one alkaloidal characters indicates that they both, taken together, are monophyletic, but that Amphithalea by itself is paraphyletic, Coelidium being nested in it. Coelidium is therefore reduced to synonymy under Amphithalea, and the necessary nomenclatural changes are made.
10.2307/1224020|Facing still unresolved taxonomic problems in many plant groups and overshadowed by recent economic and social changes, classical plant taxonomy in China is seriously threatened by the gradual loss of taxonomists and funding, not to mention the extinction of undescribed plant taxa resulting from environmental degradation at the approach of the 21st century. The status of floristic projects, taxonomic publications, and the staff and students of herbaria and botanical institutes is presented. The solution to problems limiting plant taxonomic research and floristics in China appears to be dependent primarily on supporting current co-operative projects and raising additional research funds through Chinese and international collaborative efforts.
10.2307/1224021|Analysis of central Asian Juniperus using RAPD revealed that J. centrasiatica, J. turkestanica, and J. pseudosabina appear to belong to a single species, to be named J. pseudosabina. This conclusion is also supported by previous work on terpenoids. Putative J. indica from Nepal (shrub form) was found to be distinct from J. pseudosabina. It appears that the common scale-leaved shrub or tree juniper of the Himalayas should be called J. indica not J. pseudosabina.
10.2307/1224022|The British Antarctic Survey's Antarctic Plant Database holds over 50,000 herbarium records for Antarctic and sub-Antarctic flowering plants and cryptogams held in herbaria world-wide. In addition, it holds information on species occurrences recorded in the literature for southern polar regions and synonymy indexes for relevant species. The database has been linked to a geographic information system, which can aid record validation and resource management as well as the study of species distributions and biodiversity.
10.2307/1224025|Reticularia Bull. was validly published in 1787 or 1788 already, by means of a descriptio generico-specifica, not in (1790 or) 1791 as has been generally assumed. It is therefore an earlier homonym of Reticularia Baumg. (lichens), a name validly published in 1790 but not on the page from which it is usually cited. Reticularia alba Bull., the single included element and original type of Reticularia Bull., is a later taxonomic synonym of Mucilago crustacea, hence Reticularia Bull. is a later synonym of Mucilago.
10.2307/1224026| There is no extant original material for Geum pyrenaicum Mill., a name sometimes attributed to Willdenow. Although the name has often been misapplied to the hybrid G. montanum  G. rivale by Central European authors in the past, and may have been so used by both Miller and Willdenow, its universal use for a Pyrenean-Cantabrian endemic for 150 years makes it advisable to fix that application by designation of an appropriate neotype. 
10.2307/1224027|Hypochaeris leontodontoides is here lectotypified by a specimen in the Ball collection in London (BM). Some systematic and nomenclatural aspects of the taxa of the H. laevigata group are discussed.
10.2307/1224028|The lectotypification of Clusia major L., the type of Clusia L., is examined. It is shown that the lectotypes hitherto proposed should be superseded; a new lectotype is designated. As a consequence, C. subg. Thysanoclusia and C. sect. Stauroclusia become C. subg. Clusia and sect. Clusia respectively. The correct name for C. sect. Euclusia, nom. inval., is C. sect. Chlamydoclusia. An earlier lectotype designation for C. minor is superseded as the holotype still exists. A lectotype for C. plukenetii Urb. is also designated.
10.2307/1223760|The medical treatise written by Guilielmus of Saliceto around 1290 includes 13 chapters on renal affections, in which 133 plant species are mentioned. Almost all have been identified by means of comparison with 15th century herbals and 16th century herbaria and books. 39% are native to Italy and were presumably collected in the wild, 42% are cultivated plants, either native to the Mediterranean region or introduced since Roman times, 4% were introduced to Italy from E. Europe or the Middle East in the late Middle Ages, and 15% were imported from the east in the form of spices or drugs. Most of the plants mentioned by Guilielmus correspond entirely (56%) or in part (8%) with modern genera or species accepted with similar names or epithets in Linnaean nomenclature. 19% of Guilielmus' designations denote modern species or genera but did not enter Linnean nomenclature. Only some 17% of the Medieval names are of uncertain application or designated heterogeneous taxa; their use, if it persists, has substantially changed since the 16th century.
10.2307/1223761|In a taxonomic synopsis of the Euphorbia obtusifolia complex, new data are presented on typification and synonymy. Keys, illustrations and a distribution map help clarify this complex and correct certain errors and historical inaccuracies regarding the identity and distribution of E. obtusifolia and E. regis-jubae. A new variety, E. obtusifolia var. wildpretii, is described.
10.2307/1223762|Micromorphological characters assist in the circumscription of the family Myricaceae and can be used to distinguish the segregate genera. The fossil record is based on leaf compressions, fruits and pollen grains. In the Tertiary the commonest genus was Myrica sensu stricto.
10.2307/1223763|Intermediate specimens between Grindelia chiloensis and Haplopappus pectinatus occur in Patagonia (Argentina). They were analysed using the methods proposed by Wells (distance diagram) and Wilson (character count procedure). With both methods the hypothesis of hybridity is supported. A close proximity of H. pectinatus to the genus Grindelia is also suggested by a high percentage of stainable pollen grains in the putative hybrids, chromosome morphology, and achene anatomy. Based on such evidence, the new combination G. anethifolia (H. pectinatus Phil., non G. pectinata Baker) is proposed.
10.2307/1223764|Lectotypes, neotypes and epitypes are designated by 52 specialists for 211 previously untypified Linnaean plant names belonging to the family Compositae (Asteraceae). These newly proposed types support the current usage of the names concerned. Earlier but ineffective or supersedable type statements are discussed. A lectotype is also designated for the Linnaean combination Hieracium pyrenaicum var. austriacum (Jacq.) L., based on Crepis austriaca Jacq.
10.2307/1223765|Not all botanists in need of illustrating their publications are gifted artists, and trained as such; nor can every botanist or publisher afford hiring professional help. To those who decide to produce their own drawings, this paper gives practical guidance of how to proceed, illustrated by examples of how palatable the results may look.
10.2307/1223766|One of the major challenges for taxonomists today is the organisation of collection data by making use of modern computer technology for data storage and retrieval. Recent developments enabling data accessing in the field are here discussed. A field-tested electronic system for data gathering, recording, storage, transfer, formatted printout (e.g. for labelling) and, finally, dissemination by on-line access, called ELCEN (Electronic CEN Herbarium), is described. It makes use of new, easily portable, hand-held "personal data assistants" (PDAs) that connect easily with personal computers (PCs) and workstations, and results in global data availability via Internet's World Wide Web. Among the advantages of the new system are its ease of use, the elimination of most typing errors during data entry, and the reduction of the time lag between data input and data availability.
10.2307/1223775|Reassessment of family alignments in the Myrtales assigns subfamilial status to three, or possibly four, monogeneric families (Sonneratiaceae, Duabangaceae, Punicaceae, and perhaps Trapaceae). Three subfamily names, previously used but not validly published, are validated. The basis for validation is summarised for all five subfamily names that are of potential use in phylogenetically based classifications of the Lythraceae.
10.2307/1223776|A lectotype is designated for Veronica multifida L., the only original element that will not disrupt the current usage of the name. Since this element is demonstrably ambiguous, an epitype is also designated.
10.2307/1223578|The traditional method of biological nomenclature and the phylogenetic nomenclature method are reviewed. Under a phylogenetic nomenclature, ranks would not be required, and names of taxa would be given definitions based on descent. The phylogenetic nomenclature method, as currently proposed, would be in conflict, not only with the Linnaean hierarchy, but also with the notion of nomenclatural types. While the phylogenetic method would increase explicitness and universality regarding the application of names, it may do so at the expense of taxonomic flexibility and circumscriptional stability of a taxon represented by a given name. Suggestions are provided on how a code of nomenclature could be designed so as to accommodate both systems.
10.2307/1223579|The three repositories of botanical art of G. Forster, artist and author of works underlying South Pacific botany, are reviewed. Identifications are given of the 6 paintings and 78 drawings held in Gotha.
10.2307/1223580|Phylogenetic analyses using parsimony were performed on three independent data sets to test generic relationships between Actaea, Cimicifuga, and Souliea. Analyses of morphology and nuclear ribosomal DNA ITS were performed on 23 species of Cimicifuga, 4 species of Actaea, and the single species of Souliea. Analysis of chloroplast DNA trnL-F was applied to the same species, less two of Cimicifuga. The outgroup taxa Eranthis and Anemonopsis both resolved outside the ingroup in all parsimony analyses, whereas Souliea resolved within it. Jukes-Cantor pairwise sequence distances confirm Eranthis and Anemonopsis to be most distant. Souliea distances are comparable with those of taxa within the Actaea-Cimicifuga assemblage. A strongly supported monophyletic clade including all studied species of Actaea, Cimicifuga, and Souliea was found in all analyses. Evidence presented here allows a broader concept of Actaea to be adopted, reverting to the circumscription of Linnaeus in 1753. Seven sections, based on clades found in the total analysis, could be defined by morphological characters: A. sect. Actaea, sect. Podocarpae, sect. Cimicifuga, sect. Dichanthera, sect. Oligocarpae, sect. Pityrosperma, and sect. Souliea. One species, A. taiwanensis, is newly described and 23 new combinations are made in the ranks of section, species, and variety. Keys are provided to identify taxa at all ranks within the revised circumscription of Actaea. Maps showing the distributions of all seven sections and their constituent species are presented. Phytogeographic patterns suggest a Tertiary origin for the newly redefined genus, with species surviving in refugia during the glacial periods of the Pleistocene.
10.2307/1223581|66 genotypes of species in 50 palm genera were analysed by RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) and ISTR (inverse-sequence tagged repeat analysis). Significant numbers of polymorphic DNA fragments were generated by both techniques, which allowed identification of all individuals. Genetic similarities between the genotypes were established by cluster analysis based on Jaccard's similarity coefficients. Individuals of the same genus always formed clusters, and most of the related species formed subclusters. The systematics of individuals as established by morphological, cytological and ecological considerations, however, could only be partially confirmed by the molecular studies. For the palm species considered in this study, RAPD and ISTR represent a powerful tool for genotype identification and differentiation, but they may not be useful for analysis of genetic relationships above the genus level.
10.2307/1223582|During the last two decades of the 19th century a great deal of plant collecting occurred in Franklin County, led by the Columbus Horticultural Society, the Ohio Agricultural Experiment Station (Columbus), and the newly formed Botany Department at the Ohio State University. A number of botanical enthusiasts and students dedicated themselves to collecting and recording plant data for a county flora, whose specimens contributed significantly to the initial formation of the herbarium at the Ohio State University. Moses Craig and Augustine D. Selby were responsible for the preparation of preliminary treatments for a vascular flora of Franklin County. 22 plants are treated as introduced in the 1880s on the grounds of the Sells Brothers Circus at Sellsville (on the west side of Columbus).
10.2307/1223583|Two new families of caprifolioids, Diervillaceae and Linnaeaceae, are proposed. They correspond to the former subfamilies Diervilloideae and Linnaeoideae. A key to their genera and those remaining in Caprifoliaceae is provided.
10.2307/1223584|During the period 1948-1963, a minimum of 127,108 mounted herbarium specimens were deaccessioned from the Missouri Botanical Garden Herbarium under the direction of Robert E. Woodson and distributed by exchange or sale to at least 48 botanical institutions throughout the world. Some of these specimens were true duplicates, but many, including some types, were not. In addition, an unknown quantity of specimens, numbering perhaps in the tens of thousands, was discarded. A summary of the number of specimens deaccessioned, the nature of the material sent, and the recipient institutions is presented. An account is also given of the 63,853 specimens that have been returned to the Garden and reincorporated into the collection.
10.2307/1223586|The rules surrounding the designation of nomenclatural types to fossil plant taxa, including the definitions of the various kinds of type and the related requirements for valid publication, are found in several provisions of the "International code of botanical nomenclature." In part because of the necessarily piecemeal nature of these rules, problems and ambiguities in interpretation have arisen that merit discussion. These problems and ambiguities include: the definition of the term lectotype; the use of isotypes and epitypes; the appropriate treatment of macrofossil types that are represented by more than one specimen; the application of Article 37.4 and the citation of collectors' names; the nature of the type of a generic name; the definition of "original material"; and the imperative to indicate the repository of a type. In our view, the increasing rate of change of the "Code," which would reach a climax with the possible introduction of a "BioCode," is also promoting ambiguities, and hence potential instability in plant nomenclature.
10.2307/1223587|The unused and mysterious Linnaean name Clitoria lactescens, for which no original material exists, has by some been considered a synonym of Galactia pendula, a junior name that it would thus displace. This synonymy is rejected because the validating description of C. lactescens does not fit G. pendula, and the foprmer name is neotypified in such a way that it is no longer a threat to any currently used name.
10.2307/1223588| The protologues of Triticum turgidum L. and T. spelta L. each show uncertainty in the Linnaean concept of Triticum species but pose different problems for typification. In the case of T. turgidum, Bowden's lectotypification by the specimen Herb. Linn. No. 104.2 (LINN), designated apparently on the basis of its Linnaean notation "turgidum 3", is in error. Both elements on that sheet are forms of T. aestivum and neither can be accepted as being part of the original material for T. turgidum. The various elements of the protologue are discussed and a Royen specimen is designated as lectotype of T. turgidum, thereby avoiding a major destabilization of Triticum nomenclature. For T. spelta, the original Linnaean concept includes T. dicoccum Schrank ex Schbler. Current usage of T. spelta is maintained by designating a Linnaean specimen of T. spelta at LINN as the lectotype. 
10.2307/1223589|The original concept of Allium magicum L. and A. nigrum L. is discussed, a lectotype for A. magicum is designated, and an earlier type designation of A. nigrum is rejected. Without conservation, A. magicum would become the correct name for what is currently called A. nigrum, while A. nigrum would fall into the synonymy of A. roseum L. The nomenclatural history of A. roseum is discussed and an earlier lectotypification is superseded.
10.2307/1223590|The type specimen of Thalictrum morisonii C. C. Gmel. is missing. An illustration designated as lectotype, supported by a fitting epitype also desiganted here, belongs to T. flavum L. T. morisonii in the sense of Flora europaea and T. exaltatum Gaudin are the same as T. lucidum L.
10.2307/1223591|A new name, Cerviculospermum, and a new combination, C. ovale, are proposed. The replaced name, Collospermum, is a junior homonym of a name currently used for a genus of Liliaceae.
10.2307/1224186|The phylogenetic relationships of the genera of Lecythidaceae and representatives of Scytopetalaceae were assessed using cladistic analysis of both molecular (rbcL and trnL sequences) and morphological data. The results show that the pantropical family Lecythidaceae is paraphyletic. Support was found for the monophyly of three of the four subfamilies: Lecythidoideae, Planchonioideae, and Foetidioideae. The fourth subfamily, Napoleonaeoideae, was found to be paraphyletic, with members of the Scytopetalaceae being nested within it forming a strong clade with Asteranthos. Both families share a number of morphological features, including several distinct characters such as cortical bundles in the stem. The combined analysis produced three trees of 471 steps and consistency index CI = 0.71 and retention index RI = 0.70. Asteranthos and members of Scytopetalaceae should be treated as a subfamily of Lecythidaceae, while Napoleonaea and Crateranthus (the latter based solely on morphological features) should remain in the subfamily Napoleonaeoideae. The Lecythidaceae are recircumscribed, and Asteranthos and members of Scytopetalaceae are included in Scytopetaloideae. A formal taxonomic synopsis accommodating this new circumscription is presented.
10.2307/1224187|A new subtribe is described to accommodate the genus Parochetus. A key to the subtribes of Trifolieae is provided.
10.2307/1224188| Information is presented updating an earlier paper on the subject in this journal, by Austin & Human. Notes on the nomenclature or taxonomy of Ipomoea demerariana, I. neurocephala, I. wrightii, and Convolvulus littoralis. 
10.2307/1224189|Cololejeunea formosana Mizut., whose correct name is C. ceratilobula (P. C. Chen) R. M. Schust., was earlier considered as synonymous with C. reineckeana Steph. but belongs to C. subg. Chlorocolea, whereas C. reineckeana is a member of C. subg. Pedinolejeunea. A description and illustration of C. reineckeana are provided.
10.2307/1224190|Crosses between Mediterranean strains of Aglaothamnion tenuissimum and Atlantic strains of both A. byssoides and A. pseudobyssoides support the conclusion that A. tenuissimum is conspecific with A. byssoides but that A. pseudobyssoides is a distinct species. Ceramium tenuissimum (the basionym of A. tenuissimum) antedates Callithamnion byssoides (the basionym of A. byssoides), so that the correct name of this species is A. tenuissimum. Because diagnostic features are lacking in the type specimen of C. tenuissimum, an epitype for that name is chosen. Moreover, A. tenuissimum var. mazoyerae, var. nov., is proposed for Mediterranean populations of this species that grow in habitats of low light intensity and differ morphologically from the nominal variety in the shape and size of the tetrasporangia, in the size and shape of axial cells in the basal region of the thallus, and in the absence of rhizoidal cortication.
10.2307/1224191|A list of 191 family names of Spermatophyta is presented, whose date of valid publication is earlier than the date given in App. IIB of the Code, and authorship usually different. Many of the names were published prior to the arbitrarily accepted but never legally sanctioned starting date for family names in Spermatophyta, 4 Aug 1789. The Code, "for the time being", authorises maintenance of authorship and date for conserved names listed in App. IIB. The present list foreshadows changes that would ensue were this provisional derogation to be abolished, but a continued search of the literature will likely reveal even earlier names.
10.2307/1224611|The unispecific genus Aethiocarpa was distinguished from Harmsia principally on the basis of ovary and fruit structure: one-seeded, unilocular ovaries and indehiscent fruit versus two-seeded, bilocular ovaries and tardily dehiscent fruit, respectively. A critical re-examination of ovary characters, however, reveals that both genera share biovulate unilocular ovaries, which are unique within subfamily Dombeyoideae (Malvaceae). Differences in indumentum, inflorescence morphology, and number of seed per fruit, which were cited as ancillary characters distinguishing Aethiocarpa from Harmsia, do not appear to justify the recognition of two different genera. Aethiocarpa is therefore considered to be a synonym of Harmsia and the new combination H. lepidota is proposed.
10.2307/1224612|The subtribe Blennospermatinae is usually defined to comprise four genera (Abrotanella, Blennosperma, Crocidium, and Ischnea). The placement of Abrotanella in the Blennospermatinae has been disputed, and the monogeneric subtribe Abrotanellinae was recently erected. A cladistic analysis of ndhF sequence data provides strong support for grouping Blennosperma with the Senecioneae, while Abrotanella is only weakly associated with the Senecioneae and does not form a monophyletic group with Blennosperma. Crocidium and Ischnea (not sequenced) are morphologically close to Blennosperma. Hence, the Blennospermatinae are best circumscribed to include only Blennosperma, Crocidium, and Ischnea, but not Abrotanella. The tribal position of Abrotanella remains uncertain.
10.2307/1224613|Kobresia littledalei, published by C. B. Clarke in 1908, was so far misunderstood by several botanists. The name is lectotypified and accepted for a hitherto neglected separate species, here redescribed.
10.2307/1224614|Many herbaria store their most valuable botanical specimens, such as types, mounted on herbarium paper, within closed or semi-closed pliable cardboard folders. In order to minimise the risk of damage through handling and shipping, an archival hardboard folder was designed, to provide maximum protection. The design accommodates herbarium sheets of different sizes and specimens of various thickness. The folders can be made from materials available from art supply stores.
10.2307/1224620|Lectotypes and epitypes are designated by 6 specialists for 29 out of 30 previously untypified Linnaean plant names pertaining to the family Orchidaceae. These newly proposed types support the current usage of the names concerned. Earlier but ineffective or supersedable type statements are discussed.
10.2307/1224621|Lectotypes are designated for the names of the two species of Grewia (Tiliaceae) described by Linnaeus in 1753.
10.2307/1224622|Regelia, through its type R. ciliata, is here typified by a specimen that enables current usage of the name to be preserved. The name that has been considered by some botanists to be the base name of R. ciliata, Melaleuca sprengelioides, represents a species of Beaufortia and is newly transferred to that genus.
10.2307/1224623|3 generic and 13 specific names belonging in the leguminous tribe Loteae are typified.
10.2307/1224624|Forgesia Gerrienne (Zosterophyllophytina) is a later homonym of extant Forgesia Comm. ex Juss. 1789 (Saxifragaceae). The anagram Gosferia is proposed as a new generic name for the fossil taxon.
10.2307/1224625|The author of the generic name Orostachys is Fischer, who validly published the name in 1809, not Candolle, Sweet, or Berger, as has been cited in a number of botanical works.
10.2307/1224626| The name Erucastrum is attributed directly to C. Presl in most reference books and floras but is in fact based on Brassica sect. Erucastrum DC. By consequence its type is Brassica erucastrum L., not Erucastrum virgatum C. Presl as usually accepted. The latter binomial is to be replaced by the old, traditional name Erucastrum laevigatum (L.) O. E. Schulz (Sinapis laevigata L.) as, according to Gmez Campo, S. laevigata L. is the same as E. laevigatum subsp. baeticum (Boiss.) Gmez-Campo. 
10.2307/1224431| Setchellanthus caeruleus Brandegee is a rare microphyllous shrub, densely pubescent with T-shaped Malpighian hairs, with many stamens, 5-7 free blue to lilac petals, an elongate, 3-carpellate, deeply trisulcate ovary with axile placentation and proto-parietal vasculature, and a straight embryo essentially lacking endosperm. It is known only from two widely disjunct areas in the Chihuahuan and Tehuacn deserts of northern and south-central Mexico. The genus was named for phycologist W. A. Setchell (1864-1963; a biographical note is included). Its taxonomy, morphology, and geography are outlined, and the results of four associated papers on flower and seed anatomy, vegetative anatomy, pollen structure, and nucleotide sequence of the rbcL gene are discussed. The species is so highly distinct in its relatively primitive morphology and chemistry that it is here placed into its own, newly established monotypic family near the Caricaceae and Moringaceae and basal to the core group of glucosinolate (mustard oil) producing families (but less basal than, e.g., Bretschneideraceae, Akaniaceae, and Tropaeolaceae). The new evidence supports Dahlgren's reclassification of an expanded order Capparales. 
10.2307/1224432|Floral, seed, and fruit anatomy of the unispecific Mexican genus Setchellanthus are described. The genus has floral features that are characteristic of some traditionally defined Capparales or close allies of an expanded order Capparales, viz., a (5-)6(-7)-merous flower with a 3-merous gynoecium and an androecium comprising (5-)6(-7) fascicles of stamens that develop centrifugally; a short androgynophore and well-developed gynophore; a 3-loculed gynoecium with a 3-lobed style and 3 conduplicate valves that separate from the vascular placental column at maturity much as do the valves of Cleome or Brassicaceae. Setchellanthus, however, has straight seeds with a spatulate embryo and a non-fibrous exotegmen; it lacks the reniform seeds with fibrous exotegmen characteristic of the core Capparales. Vascular bundles in the fruit wall are amphivasal and show an extensive secondary growth that produces tracheids like those of the secondary xylem of stems; bordered pits are present in the wall of the inner epidermis cells. The floral and seed anatomy as well as the distinctive fruit anatomy support a position of Setchellanthus that is near-basal to the core Capparales.
10.2307/1224433|Pollen of Setchellanthus caeruleus was studied by light, scanning electron, and transmission electron microscopy and found to differ profoundly from that of potentially related families such as the Brassicaceae, Capparaceae, Caricaceae, Cistaceae (Helianthemum canadense, here re-investigated and found to have pollen shed in tetrads), and Limnanthaceae. These differences support the segregation of S. caeruleus into a new separate family.
10.2307/1224434|On account of its distinctive features, Setchellanthus cannot be included within any of the families of glucosinolate-producing plants. Features unknown in any of these families include abundant vasicentric tracheids, abaxial axial parenchyma, and only short uniseriate rays (composed of upright cells) in wood; and the presence of wide-helix tracheary elements in leaves. Wood offers the greatest number of phyletically significant features, and wood of Capparaceae offers many similarities, although the wood of Helianthemum (Cistaceae) is even more like that of Setchellanthus. Despite the fact that no myrosin cells were observed in Setchellanthus, it appears closest, on the basis of present information, to the glucosinolate-producing families.
10.2307/1224435|The nucleotide sequence (1462 bases) from the chloroplast gene for the large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rbcL) was utilised for the monotypic Mexican endemic genus Setchellanthus to assess its phylogenetic affinities. Phylogenetic analyses of rbcL sequence data robustly group Setchellanthus with other mustard oil producing plants included in Dahlgren's expanded order Capparales. Within this assemblage, maximum parsimony places Setchellanthus sister to a clade comprised of the North American family Limnanthaceae, the sister taxa Koeberlinia + Salvadora + Batis, and the core Capparales (Brassicaceae + Capparaceae, Gyrostemonaceae + Resedaceae, Pentadiplandraceae, and Tovariaceae). Maximum likelihood analyses reverse the relationship of Setchellanthus and Limnanthaceae, placing Setchellanthus sister to the Koeberlinia + Salvadora + Batis plus the core Capparales assemblage, with Limnanthaceae sister to these. The rbcL sequence of Setchellanthus possesses a putative stop codon ending at position 1440, twelve bases beyond the 1428 site usual for dicots. This extended 3' terminus is consistent within the expanded Capparales for a clade that comprises the above-named taxa. The position of Setchellanthus in the rbcL phylogram provides support for elevation of this unispecific genus to family rank, postulated in view of its unique morphological characters.
10.2307/1224436|The Plant Names Project is a collaborative venture between the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, the Harvard University Herbaria, and the Australian National Herbarium. The "Index kewensis," the "Gray card index," and the "Australian plant names index" are being combined and the data edited to produce the "International plant names index" (IPNI). IPNI will consist of the names and associated basic bibliographical details of all seed plants. Its goal is to eliminate the need for finding and checking basic bibliographic information about plant names; such names will be presented in a distributed data base, freely available and with the data standardised against authority data and ultimately verified. IPNI will be a dynamic resource, globally current, continually improving in accuracy, and allowing, indeed encouraging, direct contributions by all members of the botanical community.
10.2307/1224437|Recent examination of herbarium specimens of certain red algal genera possessing carrageenan cell wall material polysaccharides (Gigartina, Callophyllis) has revealed that some material is undergoing serious and irreversible deterioration within apparently stable herbarium conditions. Damage is apparently caused by sulphuric acid, produced through hydrolysis of sulphate half-ester groups associated with carrageenans and resulting in extremely low pH values (0-1) in affected thallus portions. Measures are recommended to halt incipient damage and hopefully save affected specimens from total destruction.
10.2307/1224438|The possibilities of calculating similarity based on ordinal characters are evaluated by distinguishing subtypes of the ordinal scale. Multivariate analysis is most problematic when ordinal variables appear together with other scale types in the data. This difficulty is solved by extending Gower's general coefficient of similarity to ordinal data types, facilitating cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling. Two alternatives, a non-metric and a metric version, are offered. The modified formula implies that ordinal variables are equally weighted with the others, and that partially and fully ranked data are both applicable, due to the inherent standardisation procedure. A morphological data set derived for the moss genus Tortula illustrates the new approach.
10.2307/1224441|The "Index Nominum Algarum (ING)" is an ongoing project with the goal of producing and maintaining an index of scientific names of algae, both living and fossil, at all ranks. Initiated by Silva in 1949, it now comprises about 180,000 entries. Although it is currently in the form of a card file housed in the Herbarium of the University of California at Berkeley, it is being converted into a database that will be searchable on-line. Meanwhile, the cards, only about 10% of which are backed by an electronic file, have been archived as digital images on compact discs. An important by-product of the "INA" is the "Bibliographia Phycologica Universalis (BPU)," which now comprises about 65,000 references. Both the "INA" and the "BPU" have been made available to the taxonomic community continuously since their inception.
10.2307/1224442|The formerly designated lectotype of Scirpus maritimus L. is shown to be in conflict with the protologue. If maintained, it would cause unnecessary and disturbing name changes. It is therefore superseded by a Linnaean specimen newly discovered in Uppsala, which in turn is supported by a modern, fruiting specimen designated as epitype.
10.2307/1224557| The lectotype of Pinus mugo from the Sguier Herbarium, designated here, belongs to introgressive populations between the eastern and the western subspecies, generally named P. mugo subsp. mugo and subsp. uncinata, respectively. The name P. mugo subsp. mugo would not therefore represent the eastern populations of the species, as has been generally accepted, but should be adopted for the central, intermediate subspecies, known to date as P. mugo subsp. rotundata. This change, however, would so much disrupt the established nomenclature of the group that it is advisable to conserve the name P. mugo with a type that agrees with current usage. 
10.2307/1224558|Petrocoptis, a small genus of chasmophytic plants endemic to the Iberian Peninsula, is included as a subgenus within a widely defined Silene. Thus, in Europe, Silene comprises subg. Silene itself, subg. Lychnis, subg. Viscaria, subg. Conoimorpha, and subg. Petrocoptis. It is anticipated that, based on nuclear rDNA sequences, S. subg. Petrocoptis will be found to be monophyletic. The bearded hilum is the only morphological synapomorphy supporting S. subg. Petrocoptis. Four species (seven taxa) are recognised within S. subg. Petrocoptis: S. glaucifolia subsp. glaucifolia and subsp. pseudoviscosa, S. laxipruinosa, S. montserratii subsp. montserratii and subsp. crassifolia, S. pardoi subsp. pardoi and subsp. guarensis. Morphological features of diagnostic value are discussed. A key and maps of the recognised taxa are provided.
10.2307/1224559|Pubescent twigs are characteristic of Prunus susquehanae, a plant of acid, sandy or rocky barrens, whereas other members of the dwarf cherry complex, mostly of alkaline or neutral substrates of prairies, lakeshores, and scree slopes, have glabrous twigs. The correlation of this character with habit, ecology, and other morphological characters provides a basis for treating P. susquehanae (= P. pumila var. cuneata) as a distinct species. Related taxa are best treated as varieties of P. pumila. Current application of the scientific names is confirmed. P. pumila is lectotypified by a Miller figure, but in view of its ambiguity, a supporting epitype is also selected. Lectotypes are also designated for P. besseyi and P. susquehanae. A key and conspectus are included.
10.2307/1224560|The name Trachylejeunea chinensis Herzog is lectotypified, and the species transferred to the genus Lejeunea based on the following diagnostic features: a lejeuneoid gynoecial innovation, lack of ocelli in the leaf lobe, non-papillose leaf cells, and an obovate, smooth perianth. The genus Trachylejeunea is excluded from China and Asia by this transfer.
10.2307/1224561|The genus Retitribrevicolporites was established by Kar in 1985 to accommodate Lakiapollis matanomadhensis, whereas this species was united with the earlier Tricolporopollis by Tripathi & H. P. Singh in 1985. The latter taxonomic treatment is here confirmed. Tricolporopollis presently comprises four named species known only from Indian Tertiary (Palaeocene to Eocene) sediments. Its possible relation to fossil pollen from other areas is unknown.
10.2307/1224562|A list of suprageneric names associated with the Ranunculaceae is given, including the validly published names of 5 orders, 15 families, 18 subfamilies, 23 tribes, and 21 subtribes, as well as 23 unranked names with Latin diagnoses and 74 invalidly published "names". For the latter, some of which are in current use, the reason of their non-valid status is given by means of a reference to the pertinent article in the Code.
10.2307/1224563|Dried leaf samples were exposed to sulphuryl fluoride (Vikane) during herbarium fumigation. DNA was extracted from fumigated leaf samples and from unfumigated controls. Both fumigated and control samples yielded good quality DNA; DNA amplification yielded similar products from both sets of samples. Vikane does not appear to degrade DNA present in herbarium specimens, and appears to be a non-destructive fumigant for pest control in herbaria.
10.2307/1224564|The article describes an extended entity-relationship model covering biological collections, i.e. natural history collections of biotic origin; data collections used in floristic or faunistic mapping, survey, and monitoring projects; live collections such as botanical or zoological gardens, seed banks, microbial strain collections and gene banks; as well as novel collection kinds such as of secondary metabolites or DNA samples. The central element in the model is the unit, which stands for any object containing, being or being part of a living, fossilised, or conserved organism. The unit may be gathered (observed or collected) in the field and derived units may recursively emerge from it through specimen processing, breeding or cultivation. In addition, units may form associations (e.g. host/parasite), ensembles (lichen on a rock with fossils), and assemblages (herd, artificial grouping). Gathering events, specimen management (acquisition, accession, storage, preservation, exchange, ownership), and taxonomic or other identifications relate to the unit and are treated in detail. Geographic and geo-ecological data have not been fully modelled; taxonomic (name) data and descriptive information are treated by reference to other published models.
10.2307/1223636|Neophoenix matoposensis is a newly described taxon obtained after forced growth from soil of experimental fire plots in southern Zimbabwe. It is related to three other austral genera with transparent thecae, but differs in several gametophytic and sporophytic characters. Forced diaspore bank analysis is shown to be of value in uncovering mosses that are small in stature and appear to have a short life cycle and limited time of above-ground exposure. The technique may prove useful in biodiversity analysis in general. Two similarly hyalothecoid pottiaceous species were also uncovered in soil samples from the same area: Bryoceuthospora aethiopica is new to Zimbabwe, Uleobryum occultum (of which U. curtisii is a new synonym) is new to Africa, having been previously known from Brazil and Australia.
10.2307/1223637|Neurolejeunea fukiensis was hitherto the only species of Neurolejeunea found in China and the whole of Asia. It is here transferred to Cheilolejeunea, primarily on account of the following diagnostic features: a narrow stem (its ventral merophytes 2 cells wide), very shortly bifid to emarginate underleaves, the absence of ocelli, an elongate second tooth and obsolete first tooth of the leaf lobule, and a distal hyaline papilla. By this transfer, Neurolejeunea becomes a New World genus.
10.2307/1223638|Greguss proposed several generic names for homoxylous woods in the 1950s and 1960s. Several are, however, not validly published or fall into synonymy. The present review is based on the re-examination of the original material and protologues. The new combination Agathoxylon parenchymatosum is proposed as a consequence of such re-examination.
10.2307/1223639|Among the 1657 mostly unpublished drawings of Caribbean plants made by Charles Plumier between 1689 and 1697, 6 concern species of Aristolochia. All have served, either in original (kept in the Central Library of the National Museum of Natural History in Paris) or in copy (from the series drawn for Boerhaave in 1733 and studied in 1738 by Linnaeus), or as published plates base on either set, or by an associated description, as the main basis for 7 heterotypic binomials referring to 6 species. Having studied the original drawings and Plumier's correlated manuscript notes in Paris as well as the 4 extant Boerhaave copies and all relevant literature, the authors critically review the typification and application of the binomials concerned, designating lecto- or neotypes where needed and epitypes in most cases. Current usage of names is maintained with two exceptions. The name A. bilabiata has, since 1966, been misapplied to the species that was previously and correctly known as A. oblongata, and should therefore now be rejected as a confused name (rather than being adopted in the sense of its type, displacing A. chasmema to designate a rare endemic of Haiti, Hispaniola). A. punctata, so far considered a doubtful name, is synonymous with A. fuertesii and must be adopted in its stead for another seldom collected endemic of Hispaniola.
10.2307/1223640|Based on analysis of morphological characters and ITS sequences, a taxonomic revision of Loropetalum and Tetrathyrium is presented. Oliver's merging of Tetrathyrium under Loropetalum is corroborated. L. subcapitatum, L. indicum, and T. simaoense are reduced to synonymy under L. chinense. E. Asian Corylopsis is sister of Loropetalum among the 12 genera of Hamamelidoideae studied, which form four monophyletic clades coextensive with three tribes and one subtribe of Endress: Corylopsideae, Loropetalinae, Fothergilleae, and Eustigmateae.
10.2307/1223641|The phylogeny of genera related to Pultenaea was investigated using three independent data sets: morphology and nucleotide sequences of non-coding DNA from the nucleus (ITS) and the chloroplast (trnL-F). Elucidating the relationships of two species anomalous in Pultenaea -- P. neurocalyx and P. selaginoides -- was the principal question. Despite some incongruence among the data sets, P. neurocalyx is unambiguously placed with Eutaxia, but its formal taxonomic placement -- either as a species of Eutaxia or as a monotypic new genus -- is left undecided pending a species-level analysis of that group. The precise phylogenetic position of P. selaginoides is not clear, due to incongruence between the ITS and trnL-F data sets. Its most likely relationship is with Almaleea, as indicated by both morphology (weakly) and trnL-F (strongly). To accommodate this species, a unispecific new genus, Stonesiella, is created, diagnosed by characters of the inflorescence and bracts, and the absence of all synapomorphies of the other Pultenaea-group genera. The appropriateness of recognising monotypic genera is discussed. Monophyly of Pultenaea s.str. (excluding P. selaginoides and P. neurocalyx) is supported equivocally.
10.2307/1223642| IOS, a scientific member of the International Union of Biological Sciences, was officially established at the Stdtische Sukkulenten-Sammlung in Zrich, Switzerland, in 1950. The IOS is presented, with emphasis on the structure of the organisation, its congresses, publications, conservation activities, and its potential services to the international scientific community. An address list of the current IOS board members and section co-ordinators is provided. 
10.2307/1223643|The internal transcribed spacers (ITS-1 and ITS-2) of nuclear ribosomal DNA were sequenced for 33 populations of 31 species of Artemisia. The sequence data support the monophyly of the genus in its classical, broad sense, including Seriphidium and Oligosporus. Five main clades are defined, corresponding largely to the four main groups traditionally recognised in the genus: "Artemisia" (s.str.), "Absinthium", "Dracunculus", and "Seriphidium", plus the American "Tridentatae" segregated from the latter, except that "Artemisia", scattered over four different clades, is in need of a redefinition and restriction to the A. vulgaris clade. ITS data also support the hypothesis that the "Tridentatae" and "Seriphidium" are independent groups, and help differentiate the species in the A. herbaalba complex.
10.2307/1223644|Eight Malagasi species of Apiaceae were previously misplaced in the African genus Heteromorpha but have been recently excluded from it. They, with the E. African species of Pseudocarum, have remarkably unspecialised fruits and do not fit within Drude's classification system for the family, as they combine vittae characteristic of the Saniculoideae and Apioideae. They have oil ducts in the fruit ribs (intrajugal vittae) in addition to the normal ones between the ribs (vallecular vittae). The species (except one) have dentate-serrate leaf segments, and some also have dentate involucral bracts, reminiscent of the Saniculoideae. These characteristics are interpreted as symplesiomorphies, and the group of species as a whole is undoubtedly paraphyletic. A new generic classification is proposed, and a key to the genera and species is provided. Four genera, Andriana, Cannaboides, Pseudocannaboides, and Tana, are described as new, to accommodate seven species and one additional variety: A. coursii, A. marojejyensis, A. tsaratananensis, C. andohahelensis, C. andohahelensis var. denudata, C. betsileensis, Pseudocannaboides andringitrensis, and T. bojeriana. Pseudocarum laxiflorum and P. laxiflorum var. alticola are additional new combinations.
10.2307/1223645|A chemotaxonomic study of the genus Aloe indicates a remarkable quantitative and qualitative similarity in leaf exudate composition between 12 species. The diagnostic leaf exudate profile found in all representatives of this group -- a combination of homonataloin A and B with either or both of two recently described cinnamoyl chromones, aloeresin E and F, together with various coumaroyl chromones -- may serve as a "fingerprint". Taxonomic assessment and cladistic analysis of both morphological and chemical data support the transfer of A. pearsonii, previously misplaced in A. ser. Macrifoliae, to A. ser. Mitriformes, and are consistent with the broadening of the circumscription of the latter to include 5 anomalous species: A. angelica, A. yavellana, A. peglerae, A. melanacantha, and A. erinacea.
10.2307/1223646|Strongest evidence (SE) is an approach to evaluating the support provided by characters for alternative phylogenetic hypotheses (i.e., trees). Although first demonstrated in the context of parsimony, SE is equally applicable to compatibility analysis. In the logic of strongest evidence, a character that is compatible with a phylogenetic hypothesis supports the tree only to the degree at which this compatibility would be improbable under a model of cladistic dissociation between character state distribution and the tree. The support measure derived from this consideration is called the "apparent phylogenetic signal" (APS). The total support for a tree is the sum of the individual character APS values. Tree topology and character structure both affect the chance of "random" compatibility and thus the APS scores. Because a clique of compatible characters implies a specific tree (possibly more than one if the character states are unordered or there are missing data), the evidential strength of a clique may be measured as the SE support for the clique's tree by the clique's characters. Use of this measure is demonstrated on a morphological data set for North American species of Chloris (Poaceae). Cliques with the same number of characters vary tremendously in their apparent evidential quality. The strongest clique is nearly 100,000 times less likely to be compatible by chance with the tree it implies than is the weakest clique of the same size. This approach to clique evaluation is compared with character counting and Meacham's clique improbability measure.
10.2307/1223650|This article makes minor corrections to the dates given in Stafleu & Cowan's "Taxonomic literature" of 1983 for reviews of the many parts of Pfeiffer's "Nomenclator botanicus" of 1871-1875 and provides a table showing the most likely page numbers in each part.
10.2307/1223651|The nomenclatural type of the name Cuphea was stated by Graham to be C. decandra, but there is an earlier type designation by Swart who chose C. viscosissima. Both options are discussed, and it is concluded that Swart's typification must stand. A lectotype of C. viscosissima is designated, superseding the neotype proposed by Graham.
10.2307/1223652|16 binomials in Doronicum are lectotypified. All are either accepted names of species or basionyms of accepted subspecies names, in a forthcoming taxonomic revision of the genus.
10.2307/1223927|Cytological studies carried out in 98 species (22 genera out of eight families: Caprifoliaceae, Sambucaceae, Viburnaceae, Adoxaceae, Valerianaceae, Dipsacaceae, Morinaceae, and Calyceraceae) of the Dipsacales s.l. and the eventually related families Cornaceae, and Hydrangeaceae point to a very close relationship between the Viburnaceae, Sambucaceae and Adoxaceae, corroborating the inclusion of these families into an order different from the Dipsacales, namely the Viburnales. Many cytological features shared by these families differ strongly from the Dipsacales s.str., especially (1) chromosome size and morphology, (2) the presence of cold induced chromosome regions (CIRs), (3) interphase nuclear structure, and (4) chromosome condensing behaviour at prophase. Cornaceae and Hydrangeaceae present similar interphase nuclei, but differ from the Viburnales by other karyomorphological characters. The results are discussed with respect to previous morphological, embryological, and molecular findings.
10.2307/1223928|The Teline pallida complex is studied from a nomenclatural and taxonomic viewpoint, and some comments about chorological and ecological aspects are included. Teline pallida subsp. silensis subsp. nov. is described. A synoptic table of the differences between it and its nearest relatives, identification key, illustrations, and distribution map are shown.
10.2307/1223929|Quantitative and qualitative data are given for Sarcobatus vermiculatus (Hook.) Torr. stem anatomy in order to provide information relevant to Behnke's segregation of Sarcobatus from Chenopodiaceae and his idea that Sarcobataceae belong in suborder Phytolaccineae rather than suborder Chenopodiineae. Sarcobatus has highly xeromorphic wood such as in xeric Chenopodiaceae (presence of vasicentric tracheids, narrow vessels, short vessel elements, numerous vessels per group, helical sculpturing of vessel walls), but these features could have evolved independently in both suborders. Nonbordered perforation plates, present in Sarcobatus, are widespread in Caryophyllales s.str. and may prove to be a defining feature for the recently expanded Caryophyllales together with the neighbouring order Santalales. A single-layered lateral meristem occurs in genera of Chenopodiinae with successive cambia, but also in genera of Phytolaccineae. Likewise, raylessness occurs in both suborders. Stem and wood anatomy does not provide decisive evidence for placement of Sarcobatus in Phytolaccineae, but it does not provide any evidence against that treatment.
10.2307/1223930|Three species of Astragalus, A. sinicus L., A. nokoensis Sasaki, and A. nankotaizanensis Sasaki, occur in Taiwan, and the latter two are endemic. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was used to determine genetic variation of the three species. Bands in RAPD profiles were treated as independent loci. From studies of 207 individuals in eight populations of Astragalus, a total of 131 RAPD bands was generated using eleven 10-mer primers. Genetic similarity among 207 individuals in the eight populations was calculated using Jaccard's coefficient. The results of the UPGMA cluster analysis were in broad agreement with previous classifications of these three species, which clearly discriminated between Astragalus sinicus, A. nankotaizanensis, and A. nokoensis. Based on RAPD data, A. nankotaizanensis and A. nokoensis were slightly closer than A. nokoensis and A. sinicus. A positive relationship between genetic distance and geographical distance for populations of A. nokoensis was also seen. The results of this study do not support classification of these three species into one species as A. sinicus s.l.
10.2307/1223931|A comprehensive overview of the relationship of alternative coding strategies to the inapplicable data coding problem is presented. In contrast to Pleijel, who argued that the presence/absence coding method (coding each observable feature as a separate character) avoids problems with non-applicable states, we show that the problem of inapplicable data is the same, no matter whether observable features are coded as separate characters or as two or more states of a character. The inapplicable data problem is concealed in presence/absence coding if the distinction between inapplicable and absent data is not made.
10.2307/1223932|A model for representing taxonomic data in a flexible and dynamic system capable of handling and comparing multiple simultaneous classifications is presented. The Prometheus Taxonomic Model takes as its basis the idea that a taxon can be circumscribed by the specimens or taxa of lower rank which are said to belong to it. In this model alternative taxon concepts are therefore represented in terms of differing circumscriptions. This provides a more objective way of expressing taxonomic concepts than purely descriptive circumscriptions, and is more explicit than merely providing pointers to where circumscriptions have been published. Using specimens as the fundamental elements of taxon circumscription also allows for the automatic naming of taxa based upon the distribution and priority of types within each circumscription, and by application of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. This approach effectively separates the process of naming taxa (nomenclature) from that of classification, and therefore enables the system to store multiple classifications. The derivation of the model, how it compares with other models, and the implications for the construction of global data sets and taxonomic working practice are discussed.
10.2307/1223934|A simple method for isolation of genomic DNA from wild plants sampled in remote field areas is presented. The protocol combines NaCl/CTAB leaf preservation with sorbitol extraction of secondary compounds which often contain inhibitors of Taq DNA polymerase activity. The obtained DNA is suitable for random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis of plant populations as well as for specific amplification of chloroplast DNA sequences. The NaCl/CTAB leaf preservation is a powerful alternative to silica gel drying-based preservation.
10.2307/1223833|The distribution of vestured pits in the secondary xylem of all major groups of Malvales s.l. is investigated and compared with recent circumscriptions and phylogenetic insights of the order. While the monophyly of the core Malvales, including Bombacaceae, Malvaceae s.str., Sterculiaceae, and Tiliaceae, is supported by the lack of vestured pits, the character is consistently present in three malvalean alliances that are well supported based on molecular data: (1) Bixaceae, Cochlospermaceae, and Diegodendraceae; (2) Cistaceae, Dipterocarpaceae s.l. (including Monotaceae), and Sarcolaenaceae; and (3) Thymelaeaceae s.l. (including Aquilariaceae and Gonystylaceae). Vestured pits are absent in other malvalean taxa such as Petenaea, Muntingiaceae, Neuradaceae, and Sphaerosepalaceae. Families that are now excluded from the order, such as Dirachmaceae, Elaeocarpaceae, and Huaceae also have non-vestured pits. Rudimentary vestures in Plagiopteraceae, however, do not necessarily indicate a malvalean affinity.
10.2307/1223834|Evidence from morphology and molecular sequence data from three chloroplast genes, rbcL, ndhF, and atpB, have shown that the genus Maesa constitutes an evolutionary lineage separate from the other three primuloid families, Theophrastaceae, Myrsinaceae, and Primulaceae. The new family Maesaceae is here formally recognised, its taxonomic status being changed from a subfamily of Myrsinaceae. The new family comprises a single genus, Maesa Forssk., with some 100 species of trees or shrubs; it is diagnosed by characters such as flower pedicels with two bracteoles, a semi-inferior ovary, and indehiscent fruits with many seeds. A key to the major groups of primuloid taxa is presented.
10.2307/1223835|Morphological variation of Cerastium alpinum L., C. arcticum Lange, and related taxa was investigated by numerical analyses. The analyses showed that the present division into two species is inappropriate and does not cover the levels of variation within the C. alpinum-C. arcticum complex. Two alternative models for a new and functional taxonomy of the complex are discussed: (1) that there is one widely defined species, C. alpinum, including several subspecies, (2) alternatively that arctic and non-arctic populations of what currently is named C. arcticum belong to two different taxa, both distinct from C. alpinum. Our studies indicate the presence of several evolutionary lineages, which are not adequately accounted for by the recognition of a widely circumscribed C. alpinum, and support a subdivision of current C. arcticum into two separate species, C. arcticum Lange s.str. and C. nigrescens (H. C. Watson) Edmondston ex H. C. Watson. A revised taxonomic treatment is presented.
10.2307/1223836|A combination of morphological data and RAPD markers were analysed using thirty colonies from Brittany (France) in six taxa of Polytrichum: P. commune, P. c. var. perigoniale, P. formosum, P. juniperinum, P. piliferum, and P. strictum. Ten primers selected for the RAPD study produced 166 polymorphic markers useful for cluster analysis. The Jaccard index of similarity was high within and among taxa and varied from 0.56 between P. commune and P. formosum to 0.89 between P. formosum and P. juniperinum. For the morphological study, shape of terminal cells of the green lamellae covering the upper surface of leaves allowed differentiation of taxa. In P. commune var. perigoniale these cells were narrower and less deeply notched than in P. commune. The diameter of leaves was scored for many individuals of the six taxa and revealed a sexual dimorphism for size. Female plants have a significantly larger leaf rosette diameter than male plants. Morphological results are largely consistent with RAPD data. However, the high level of genetic differences of P. c. var. perigoniale and P. strictum with other taxa demonstrates the potential of molecular and genetic data in phylogenetic analysis among closely related taxa. The cluster analysis divides the taxa into two groups: (1) P. commune, P. formosum and P. c. var. perigoniale; and (2) P. juniperinum, P. piliferum, and P. strictum. The results do not support splitting the genus into Polytrichum and Polytrichastrum nor the possibility of hybrid origin of P. c. var. perigoniale between P. commune and P. formosum.
10.2307/1223838|Arguments are given regarding typification of Indocalamus tesselatus, Phyllostachys bambusoides var. albomarginatus, Sasa veitchii, and the genus Sasa (all Poaceae).
10.2307/1223839|Lectotypes, neotypes and epitypes are designated by 26 specialists for 107 previously untypified Linnaean plant names belonging to the family Poaceae (Gramineae) and also for one Jacquin name. These newly proposed types support the current usage of the names concerned. Earlier but ineffective or supersedable type statements are discussed.
10.2307/1223852| The botanical authority for "Cucurbita moschata (Cucurbitaceae)" is frequently given as (Duch. in Lam.) Duch. ex Poir., Duch. ex Poir, or just simply Poir., in reference to A. N. Duchesne's contribution to volume 2 of J. B. P. A. de M. de Lamarck's "Encyclopdie Mthodique, Botanique," published in Paris by Panckoucke in 1786 and volume 11 of J. L. M. Poiret's "Dictionnaire des Sciences Naturelles," published in 1818. However, the binomial "Cucurbita moschata" apparently was published first in Duchesne's "Essai sur l'Histoire Naturelle des Courges," of which a number of copies exist in libraries in Paris. This small, duodecimo book consists of 46 pages but does not bear a date, place of publication, nor the name of the publisher. The "Essai" contains most of the same rows of print as those of the article in Lamarck's "Encyclopdie" and contains a note added in proof dated 18 August 1786, indicating that it too must have been published in 1786 in Paris by Panckoucke. The "Essai" differs from the article in the "Encyclopdie" by presenting the binomial "Cucurbita moschata," by its completeness, and by its clarity of presentation. "Cucurbita moschata" was also named and described by Duchesne in A. H. Tessier and A. Thouin's "Encyclopdie Mthodique, Agriculture," volume 3, page 606, which was published in 1793, also in Paris by Panckoucke. Emphasizing horticulture instead of botany, this is a shorter version of the "Essai" and served in part as the basis for Poiret's writing on "Cucurbita" in his "Dictionnaire." There is a strong likelihood that the "Essai" was issued prior to the first part of volume 2 of the "Encyclopdie Mthodique, Botanique," and is thus also the first publication of "Cucurbita maxima." 
10.2307/1224342|Fifty years of comparative and systematic plant morphology and anatomy are reviewed. Thanks to new techniques (TEM, SEM, cinematography, molecular analyses), and new methods and concepts (cladistics, evolutionary paleobotany, molecular systematics and molecular developmental genetics), plant systematics and comparative structural studies saw major progress. The integration of micromorphological with molecular data has led to an increasingly robust phylogeny of the angiosperms. Successes and failures in the premolecular era of phylogenetic classification using morphological and/or anatomical markers only are illustrated with examples. With the new phylogenetic framework, it becomes possible to trace the evolution of characters more accurately than before. Central problems in comparative and systematic structural studies are the meaning of homology and character definition; some aspects have been elucidated but new ones have appeared with the molecular dimension in evolutionary biology. In vegetative anatomy, the integration of ecological and systematic anatomy into "ecophyletic" anatomy has led to a better understanding of the driving forces behind evolutionary diversification of wood and leaf anatomical attributes. However, the intertwining of ecological (extrinsic) and organisational (intrinsic) constraints in the origin of form remains a major challenge for future studies.
10.2307/1224343|The rise and fall over the first fifty years of plant chemosystematics, employing secondary products, is outlined here. The retention of some degree of activity in this field is recommended, especially with the flavonoids that are of universal occurrence. This is not only to further refine systems of plant classification below the family level, but also to map the still largely uncharted territory of bioactive metabolites in plants. Almost every plant species has a unique collection of secondary constituents distributed throughout its tissues, a proportion of which is likely to respond positively to an appropriate medical bioassay. The success of the chemosystematic approach to the search for a renewable source of taxol, the anti-cancer drug from Taxus brevifolia, is described.
10.2307/1224344|The status of cytological and cytogenetic data as evidence of value in taxonomic decision-making and biosystematic investigations over the past 50 years is surveyed. The main headings considered are chromosome number, genome size, chromosome morphology, chromosome staining characteristics, chromosome and genome disposition in the cell, and chromosome behaviour and homology. The main conclusions are that many of the exciting new developments at the borders of cytogenetics and molecular biology (molecular cytogenetics) are producing a wealth of new data of enormous taxonomic and evolutionary importance, but that for these to reach their full impact it is essential that they are fully integrated with traditional cytological data, the need for which remains as great as ever.
10.2307/1224345|An overview of plant macromolecular systematics during the period 1950-2000 is presented. The general trend during this period has been from secondary compounds (not included in this review) to proteins and then to DNA. Amino acid sequencing of proteins from the 1960s through the 1970s, while having very little lasting impact on plant phylogeny, raised a number of issues that continue to be discussed. Enzyme electrophoresis has provided data at the population and lowest taxonomic levels, and has stimulated discussions and studies on the tempo and mode of speciation. DNA data, initially from restriction sites and subsequently from sequencing, have been employed extensively in generating phylogenies for groups ranging from species and genera up to plants as a whole. Despite the potential, molecular data have been used infrequently to study evolutionary processes and speciation. Phylogenies generated from molecular data provide the necessary framework for such investigations. The incorporation of molecular data has had a positive stimulatory effect on plant systematics during the past five decades, but the results of molecular studies are of greatest value when they are part of more broadly-based investigations that include more "traditional" approaches such as field and chromosomal studies. However, one of the side effects of increased emphasis on molecular systematics has been less emphasis on "traditional" systematic studies. Hopefully, the next five decades will witness a melding of the old and new to continue the "unending synthesis" that makes systematics such a vital discipline in plant biology.
10.2307/1224346|A GIS application of the program ArcView 3.1 is presented that creates potential plant distribution maps based on data from georeferenced specimen data bases. The application makes use of the relationship between species distribution and environmental parameters such as altitude, humidity, or temperature, to predict a taxon's potential distribution. The application contains tools for modification and further refinement of basic maps.
10.2307/1224347|In science, the internet is used at present mostly as an electronic publishing tool. It is highly desirable to increasingly use it as a working and production tool for collaborative projects in taxonomy and biodiversity as well. The method described here requires neither programming nor web-server expertise. Provided that the DELTA data standard is used, projects can be imported into the DeltaAccess database application. Using HTML data submission forms automatically generated from the database, projects can then be established and interactively revised over the internet. The forms permit adding new information as well as revising existing information. They are user-platform independent and require only standard web browser functionality. This standard-based approach avoids the repeated development of tools for using the internet as a working space. The DeltaAccess application is distributed over the internet under a General Public License.
10.2307/1224351| In conjunction with a proposal to reject the name Orchis latifolia L. 1753 (Pedersen 2000), the nomenclature of the two species commonly known as Dactylorhiza majalis (Rchb.) P. F. Hunt & Summerh. and D. incarnata (L.) So is examined. The basionyms, Orchis majalis Rchb. 1828 and O. incarnata L. 1755, respectively, are both considered to be legitimate. The former is lectotypified here, whilst Vermeulen's lectotypification of the latter is accepted. Orchis fistulosa Moench 1794, considered by Baumann & Knkele as the basionym for the correct name of the species here called Dactylorhiza majalis, is considered to be illegitimate (O. latifolia pro syn.). Dactylorhiza strictifolia (Opiz) Rauschert is found to be a synonym of D. incarnata. Orchis comosa Scop. 1772, accepted by P. D. Sell as the basionym for the correct name of the species here called Dactylorhiza majalis, is here considered to be legitimate. However, a lectotype and an epitype designated in the present paper in effect place Orchis comosa in the synonymy of Dactylorhiza incarnata. In conclusion, the names Dactylorhiza incarnata and D. majalis should be accepted [assuming that the proposed rejection of Orchis latifolia is approved; otherwise, the name Dactylorhiza latifolia (L.) So must be recognised as the correct name for either D. incarnata, D. sambucina, or D. majalis--depending on its much-debated typification]. However, if a wide species concept is applied, Orchis majalis Rchb. 1828 may be found conspecific with O. elata Poiret 1786 [the basionym of Dactylorhiza elata (Poiret) So]. 
10.2307/1224352|Clarification of the definition of a generitype from the "Sydney Code" onwards shows that previous citations of generitypes for Sasamorpha represented not the type but rather the names considered correct for the "type species". Sasamorpha purpurascens was actually the first name designated as the generitype, for which S. borealis is currently considered the correct name.

10.2307/1224354|As of mid-2000 over 4,400 proposals have been made to conserve and/or reject botanical names, almost all at the rank of family, genus or species. Information on all proposals has been compiled, including the author and places of publication of each proposal, as well as the place of publication of the report on the proposals by the Committees for particular groups, the General Committee report, where cited in a Synopsis of Proposals, where ratified by a Congress, and where each of the approved proposals first appeared in a Code. With nearly 3000 of these names already in the Code the success rate of proposals approaches two-thirds.

10.2307/1223969|Biosystematics, the study of variation patterns and evolution at the species level and below, flourished In the 1950s. Higher evolutionary level studies, however, were stalled because there was no convincing way of hypothesising relationships. Phenetic systematics developed in the late 1950s as a critique of both the goals and methods of evolutionary systematics, its own goals being those earlier stated by Gilmour (1940: 472, emphasis in original): "A natural classification is that grouping which endeavours to utilise all the attributes of the individuals under consideration, and hence is useful for a very wide range of purposes". Phenetic computer-assisted analyses of data became popular. Nevertheless, many systematists were specifically interested in phylogenies. By the late 1970s several methods that produced hypotheses of phylogeny were in use; they emphasised the possession of shared, derived characters. Since then variants of parsimony-based Hennigan analyses have remained popular. With the influx of molecular data--a flood after 1990--and the development of methods that estimated aspects of support for branches of phylogenetic trees, a radical overhaul of higher-level relationships got underway. Analyses of species-level patterns of variation were less popular during much of this period, and the process of description of species has remained largely unchanged. However, computer-based interactive keys and multi-purpose descriptive databases may fundamentally affect this area of our business. During the last 50 years some kinds of systematic work have become highly cooperative and systematics as a whole is a much more unified discipline, even as some more traditional areas of botanical systematics seem largely static if not in regress.
10.2307/1223970|There has been tremendous recent progress in understanding the relationships of plants, due to two different advances, whose cumulative impact has been great. One advance is theoretical and methodological--a revolution in how any sort of data can be used to reconstruct phylogenies. The other is empirical--the sudden availability of copious new data from the DNA level. This review briefly sets these advances in their historical context, then covers both as to their promise and problems. An important distinction between "shallow" and "deep" phylogenetic studies is developed, and morphological and molecular data are compared as potential phylogenetic markers in that context. Recent results on relationships of plants in general and green plants in particular are then considered. Future directions for classification, particularly the need for rank-free taxonomy, are also discussed in light of the rapidly improving resolution of plant relationships.
10.2307/1223971|Higher-level classification of the angiosperms has recently been addressed with large amounts of DNA sequence data, and this wealth of information now facilitates a wide range of other studies as well. An overview is presented of how both the branching pattern and amount of divergence, both morphological and molecular, can be applied to familial and ordinal classification. Angiosperm families have been classified as easily with DNA sequence data as they had been previously with morphological characteristics and represent evolutionary units held together by aspects of genomic organisation developed over long periods of time. Radiations that produced extant lineages (families) only became successful (as measured by taxon-richness) after more of the genomes of these plants were recruited into highly canalised syndromes of characteristics. Thus, single evolutionary novelties are less important in the context of the long histories of these families than is otherwise generally held for recent species/generic radiations. After monophyly, the secondary principles of maximising both information content and support led to the incorporation of divergence into classification. Using DNA patterns as a general meter of overall genetic divergence provides another means of evaluating family delimitation in groups that are not apparently as morphologically cohesive as most, although circumscribing families based on such patterns will inevitably lead to taxa that cannot be readily identified in the field. Nonetheless, in the interests of providing other researchers with a multi-purpose classification, the delimitation of some highly heterogeneous taxa is inevitable.
10.2307/1223972|The binomial system of botanical nomenclature has existed for almost 250 years, the principle of a taxon having a single correct name determined on the basis of priority of publication was formalized almost 150 years ago, and the type method for the application of scientific names of plants has had international acceptance for almost 75 years. In this historic time-frame, the achievements of the past 50 years are outlined and the question posed as to whether the next 50 years hold any prospect of change, and indeed whether any change is possible or even desirable. The requirement of botanical nomenclature to provide a stable, unambiguous reference system for plant information implies an inherent conservatism of rules and procedures--even the smallest change to the Code, however beneficial it may be in general, is virtually certain to have some destabilizing effect. Despite this truism, it is suggested that the next few years will see quite major change. One of the least of these may be the development of a separate specialist nomenclature for communication about major phyletic lineages, not so dissimilar in practice from the specialist nomenclature currently in existence for the micro-variants important in cultivated plants. Bionomenclature provides the mechanism for communication about the elements of taxonomy--elements that generally seek to reflect the greatest information on patterns of biodiversity. It will continue to communicate the general information content of taxa effectively, only if it evolves to take fuller advantage of the opportunities of the electronic age. The historical tendency to improve the rules of nomenclature by continuous "tinkering" with the Code needs to give way to a recognition that stability and simplicity are key requirements of users of names (amongst whom professional biologists are a relatively small minority), and that web access to authoritative lists will generally be their preferred approach to answering the nomenclatural questions that arise in study and use of plants, animals and micro-organisms. To remain relevant, the botanical Code, like the bacteriological, and now, to a degree, the zoological, must provide mechanisms for the endorsement of nomenclatural lists that represent the products of sound scholarship.
10.2307/1223973|Relationships among 35 species of Tropaeolaceae are estimated based on nucleotide sequence variation in plastid DNA (the rbcL gene and the rps16 intron) and nuclear ribosomal DNA (the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 tandem repeat). Tropaeolum becomes paraphyletic when Magallana and Trophaeastrum are segregated; therefore, Magallana and Trophaeastrum should be reduced to synonyms of Tropaeolum. The two new combinations Tropaeolum porifolium (Cav.) L. Andersson & S. Andersson and T. trialatum (Suess.) L. Andersson & S. Andersson are made. Further, although most of the sections of Tropaeolum that were recognised in Sparre and Andersson's monograph are monophyletic, only two entities can be distinguished that are both monophyletic and morphologically diagnosable. Therefore, the genus Tropaeolum should be subdivided into two sections, T. sect. Tropaeolum and T. sect. Chilensia. Tropaeolum sect. Tropaeolum should include the formerly recognised sections Bicolora, Dipetala, Mucoronata, Schizotrophaeum, Serratociliata, Tropaeolum, and Umbellata. Tropaeolum sect. Chilensia should include the formerly recognised genera Magallana and Trophaeastrum, and the formerly recognised T. sect. Chymocarpus.
10.2307/1223974|The phylogenetic relationships of Echium, Lobostemon, and Echiostachys (Boraginaceae-Lithospermeae) were inferred from DNA sequence variation. The presence of a bicapitate rather than a bifid stigma and plastid trnL
10.2307/1223975|Cardamine amara is represented in the Iberian Peninsula by two subspecies: the diploid (2n = 16) subsp. pyrenaea, occurring in the Eastern Pyrenees, and the tetraploid (2n = 32) subsp. olotensis, concentrated at the lower altitudes in Catalonia, N and NE of Barcelona. Morphometric analysis of populations of these taxa and four other subspecies of C. amara, which occur in other parts of Europe, supported their subspecific distinctness. RAPD (Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA) analysis of all six European subspecies of C. amara provided more evidence supporting this taxonomic treatment. Lectotypes were designated for the following names: C. amara var. parviflora Cadevall, C. amara subsp. pyrenaea Sennen, C. amara subsp. siifolia Sennen, and C. amporitana Sennen & Pau.
10.2307/1223976| Anchusa macedonica is a rare species endemic to the historical region of Macedonia, where, since its description by A. Degen and I. Drfler in 1897, it has been collected from only a few localities. The phenotypic distinctiveness of this poorly-known species was already recognized by the monographer Guuleac, who initially placed it in the monotypic Anchusa subg. Dimoniea. In later treatments, however, this subgenus was suppressed and A. macedonica included in subg. Buglossellum along with other annual taxa. The rediscovery of this species in Greece provided suitable material for detailed micromorphological, palynological and karyological observations. These revealed the strongly modified structure of pollen and stigma, which showed a surprising affinity with Gastrocotyle hispida, a monotypic genus related to Anchusa. A phenetic analysis of Anchusa s.str. summarised the distinctiveness of A. macedonica with respect to congeneric taxa. Karyotype analysis showed a diploid complement of 2n = 18 chromosomes, a number currently known for the related genus Cynoglottis but not for species of Anchusa. The occurrence in A. macedonica of a combination of morphological and karyological traits, which are otherwise separately found in unrelated species of Anchusa s.l., highlights the need for a phylogenetic analysis at the tribal level to understand better the systematic relationships and correct taxonomic placement of this species within the tribe. The original collection by I. Drfler no. 283 (W) is here designated as lectotype. 
10.2307/1223979| The type specimens of three names of taxa of Viola described from Mallorca (Balearic Islands) bearing the epithet barceloi have been studied. The lectotype of Viola barceloi Nyman and the holotype of V. suavis M. Bieb. var. barceloi O. Bols & Vigo cannot be distinguished from V. alba Besser s.l. A neotype is chosen for V. barceloi L. Chodat ( V.  balearica Rossell et al.), which is believed to be the natural hybrid between V. jaubertiana Mars & Vigineix and V. alba. 
10.2307/1223980|The originally monotypic genus Rhacophyllus was conceived for an agaric-like fungus that bore sheets of miniature sclerotium-like bodies (lysomeres) in place of lamellae. Subsequently it was demonstrated that a "normal" Coprinus-like teleomorph exists as an alternative state (morph). Following this discovery, most authors have treated Rhacophyllus as an anamorph. Ontogenetic studies indicate that the Rhacophyllus state is a variation on basidiome production. Rhacophyllus apparently was rediscovered and redescribed as a new genus Zerovaemyces, for which a new family, Zerovaemycetaceae, and a new order, Loculomycetes, were also described, all as teleomorphs. Nomenclatural application of these names are analysed, and it is concluded that Rhacophyllus (and Zerovaemyces, Zerovaemycetaceae) are best considered to be nomina anamorphosium. These decisions affect the naming of other taxa newly resolved molecularly. An analogous second case of modified basidiomes involves the anamorph Decapitatus gen. nov., described here for the well-known gemmiferous state of Mycena citricolor, Decapitatus flavidus comb. nov. (= Stilbum flavidum).
10.2307/1224510|Population genetics had played a key role in the fusion of Mendelian genetics and Darwinian natural selection into the Synthetic Theory of Evolution. The realization that all basic processes of evolution occur in or among populations suggested that evolutionary processes at all levels could be extrapolated from observations on living populations. In plants, an active tradition in ecological genetics had prepared the ground for the Synthesis, and the new initiative of "biosystematics" made full use of experimental and analytical techniques for systematics, especially at the level of species. This development got caught up in the "hardening of the Synthesis", the defensive persistence on a simplified core theory in the face of challenges from known facts and new discoveries, especially in molecular genetics. Enzyme electrophoresis was the first molecular method to be introduced into population biology. The new results revealed unexpectedly high levels of variation within populations and precipitated discussion about the selective neutrality of protein polymorphisms. This discussion distracted attention from the population genetic basis of organismic evolution. Together with the widespread adoption of molecular marker methods at the expense of other approaches, population genetics was in danger of losing its central relevance and its variety of experimental approaches. Since the end of the 1970s, calls for new initiatives have drawn attention to the importance of historical contingency in evolution, especially in the form of developmental constraints. A population genetic application of these ideas initially faced immense technical problems. A succession of new molecular marker systems suitable for the genetic analysis of populations added new resolving power, but introduced new problems with the inference of processes from basically static and descriptive data. Only very recently, methods have advanced to the point that molecular markers can help in the experimental analysis of morphological and physiological evolution. The coming challenge will be to adapt results from detailed analyses of individual plants to broadly comparative population genetic studies. The accumulated new insights of the last 50 years show that the pervasive influence of historical contingency has non--trivial consequences for evolutionary biology and taxonomy. These are strikingly exemplified by a completely changed picture of genome structure and evolution. The time seems to be right for a paradigm shift in evolutionary biology.
10.2307/1224511|Some authors have claimed that species are passive end products of evolution and thus not substantially different than higher taxa. This claim is based on reports that (1) levels of intraspecific gene flow may be too low to account for species' integration, and (2) populations are likely to diverge rather than evolve in parallel when exposed to uniform selection pressures. These conclusions are prematur. A review of the plant literature reveals that there is sufficient gene flow to enable the efficient spread of strongly favourable alleles (s > 0.05), the most likely agents of collective evolution. Moreover, estimates of s for major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) are sufficiently large to enable their spread across the range of a species, although minor QTLs seem more likely to evolve locally. In addition, evidence that intraspecific variation in genetic background affects the response of alleles to selection is rare, but examples of parallel genotypic evolution are becoming increasingly common. We conclude that, as traditionally believed, species are the most inclusive entities that directly participate in evolutionary processes. However, we also note that the traditional role of gene flow as a force that constrains differentiation due to genetic drift or local adaptation has been over-emphasised relative to its creative role as a mechanism for the spread of advantageous mutations.
10.2307/1224512|During the past fifty years our understanding of plant speciation has exploded due to the application of molecular techniques and to creative thinking and ingenious experiments. Some of the major advances regarding adaptive radiation, the lability of ecologically relevant traits, genetical and chromosomal changes associated with speciation, the tempo of speciation, recombinational speciation, and the geography of speciation are reviewed. It is apparent that the process of speciation may, but need not be, dependent on a small number of genetic and/or chromosomal changes and that speciation may occur rapidly, even without polyploidy. Speciation likely is a local phenomenon most likely involving a few local populations or a metapopulation. Polyploid taxa are dynamic entities, often by virtue of multiple origins and intragenome changes and intergenome rearrangements. The rate of evolution remains one of the most untractable issues.
10.2307/1224513|There are several inferences that can be made from studies of the fitness of hybrid plants and animals. First, the fitness of hybrids varies. However, it is not possible to make a priori predictions concerning the relative fitness of a given hybrid genotype, or a series of genotypes. For example, plant hybrids are not more likely to have elevated fitness than animal hybrids. The variation in fitness for hybrids ranges from the highest fitness relative to parental genotypes to the lowest. The variation can be due to different environments or age classes. Furthermore, notwithstanding the paradigm that derived from the Neo-Darwinian synthesis, some hybrid genotypes demonstrate elevated fitness relative to their parents. To test the evolutionary importance of hybridisation in a given species complex, it is critical that findings from greenhouse/population cage experiments be tested in the field. This latter statement is easier for a botanist to argue, but even with plants, the field experimentation needed for a rigorous test of fitness (i.e., reciprocal transplants) is at the best risky, and costly in time and resources. Yet, these are the types of studies needed to test predictions concerning the likeliest circumstances under which hybridisation will be promoted. The scientific literature over the past decade has seen a change in the tenor of papers describing natural hybridisation. Ten years ago, papers more often than not reported the use of natural hybridisation as a tool to understand divergent evolution. More recently, a majority of studies have discussed the evolutionary impact of natural hybridisation. We look forward to a continued increase in the frequency of studies that assume this process to have evolutionary importance per se.
10.2307/1224514|The systematic position of the thistle-like Gundelia of Asteraceae-Arctoteae is investigated by using sequences from the chloroplast gene ndhF in a parsimony jackknife analysis. Unexpectedly, the analysis indicates strong support for placing Gundelia with tribe Lactuceae, rather than with tribe Arctoteae. Gundelia's morphology is discussed in light of this new grouping. Another clade, although weakly supported, is formed by representatives of Arctoteae, including the two South African genera Eremothamnus and Hoplophyllum. The latter two form a sister group with 100% support.
10.2307/1224515|Flavonoids, phenolic acids and sesquiterpene lactones were evaluated as qualitative and quantitative chemosystematic markers in the genus Leontodon by HPLC-UV and HPLC-MS analyses. One population of Leontodon hispidus L. showed a high degree of variation between different plant organs and between different individuals. Seasonal variation of phenolic acids in the leaves and of sesquiterpene lactones in the rhizomes was also pronounced. In contrast, phenolics in the heads were present in nearly constant amounts during the flowering period. Within species, analyses of samples originating from different altitudes (13 samples of L. helveticus from 1600-2950 m, 19 samples of L. autumnalis from 30-2075 m, and 61 samples of L. hispidus from 40-2550 m) exhibited a significant positive correlation between altitude of the collection sites and total content of flavonoids. Unlike flavonoids, the phenolic acids showed no significant altitudinal variation. The data reveal more pronounced variation between rather than within species.
10.2307/1224516|The distribution of vestured pits in secondary xylem reveals interesting patterns that may bear on hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships within eudicots. Vestured pits are found to be relatively widespread at the base of the eurosids I, eurosids II, and euasterids I, but the feature probably has been lost or originated independently in several more derived branches of these clades. Vestured pits characterise orders Myrtales and Gentianales sensu APG; other large monophyletic taxa that consistently show vestured pits include Malpighiaceae, Polygonaceae, Brassicaceae, and most Fabaceae. Representatives from euasterids II always show nonvestured pits. The occurrence of the character implies numerous parallel origins in the following divergent, major taxa: (1) Proteaceae, (2) Polygonaceae (Caryophyllales), (3) eurosids I (Zygophyllaceae, Fabales, very few Rosales, Malpighiales), (4) eurosids II (Myrtales, Malvales, Brassicales), and (5) euasterids I (Gentianales, Lamiales, Solanales). It is demonstrated that vestured pits frequently support results from DNA data.
10.2307/1224517|I. M. Egenberg & D. Moe have suggested that herbarium specimens mounted with adhesive combined with the low temperature technique for pest eradication causes serious damage to specimens. Experiments carried out at the National Herbarium of Canada contradict these results and show that the techniques are safe when used properly.
10.2307/1224521|Lectotypes for the names V. jacquinii Baumg. and V. dentata F. W. Schmidt are here designated. Epitypes are also chosen in order to ensure accurate interpretation of both names.
10.2307/1224522|The generic name Carphobolus dates from 1863 and is lectotypified by C. lucidus.
10.2307/1224523| Three names based on Italian specimens relating to the Minuartia graminifolia complex are lectotypified. Arenaria graminifolia, the basionym of Minuartia graminifolia (Ard.) Jv. subsp. graminifolia is lectotypified by an Arduino specimen at LINN, and Arenaria rosani, the basionym of M. graminifolia subsp. rosani (Ten.) Mattf. by a Tenore collection at NAP; both lectotypifications maintain current usage of these names. In addition, Arenaria alpicola Ten., now considered a synonym of Minuartia graminifolia subsp. clandestina (Portenschl.) Mattf., is also lectotypified by a Tenore collection at NAP referable to that subspecies. 
10.2307/1224525|Based upon molecular studies, the genus Coprinus Pers. is subdivided into Coprinus sensu stricto (Agaricaceae), and Coprinellus P. Karst., Coprinopsis P. Karst., and Parasola gen. nov. in the new family Psathyrellaceae. The nomenclatural history and typifications of names previously treated as synonyms of Coprinus are reviewed. It is demonstrated that taxonomic characters previously considered not to be generically significant gain importance when correlated with molecular evidence. Many new combinations are proposed. A key using anatomical features to molecularly (phylogenetically) recognised coprinoid genera is provided.
10.2307/1224526| The use of two generic names, Asterophora and Nyctalis, for the same fungi (holomorphs) has been contradictory, and nomenclatural application remains unresolved after 175 years. Controversy first arose from a lack of understanding of the biology of these pleomorphic fungi, but debate now rests upon the interpretation of the type of Asterophora, either as an anamorph or a teleomorph, as influenced by modifications to Article 59 of the "International Code of Botanical Nomenclature" over several decades. The historical record is reviewed and Asterophora is accepted as the holomorphic generic name for three species, A. lycoperdoides, A. parasitica, and A. mirabilis. Asterophora lycoperdoides (Bull.) Ditmar is proposed separately for conservation over a sanctioned name, Asterophora agaricoides Fr.: Fr. previously largely ignored. Ugola is the oldest generic name applicable to the anamorphs. The following new combinations are proposed: Ugola physaroides ( Asterophora physaroides), U. baryana ( Hypomyces baryanus), and Asterophora mirabilis ( Nyctalis mirabilis). 
10.2307/1223885|The last fifty years have been a time of accelerated plant collection, especially in the tropics. However, this is a race against time since the destruction of natural habitats has also increased dramatically. The rate at which collecting is still adding new species of flowering plants indicates that the inventory is not nearly complete, and that the past estimates of total species numbers are low and should be increased to 320,000. The production of florulas and quantitative inventories of small areas of the tropics, accompanied by intensive fieldwork, has greatly helped to improve the level of inventory. Future collecting should be carefully targeted towards areas that are particularly threatened, such as those defined as hotspots, and also collection of rare species rather than repeated over-collection of widely distributed common taxa. Future collecting should also gather material for ancillary studies such as molecular work and evolutionary development.
10.2307/1223886|Like much of the rest of taxonomy, both floristics and monography, two of its principal outputs are being subjected, albeit slowly, to the dramatic changes in concepts and methodology that are affecting other parts of these fields. After a number of false starts, electronic web-based preparation and publication of floristic and taxonomic projects in the form of continually updated information systems and databases are beginning to replace conventional time- and information-limited floras and, to a lesser extent, monographs. Coincidental with these developments, the value of floristics is being questioned by some biologists on the grounds of its lack of scientific objectivity and its weakening of systematics as a scientific endeavour, while at the same time its fundamental importance, under the guise of completing the inventory of biodiversity, is being emphasised by other biologists and by the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Global Taxonomic Initiative. Other important developments that will affect the way in which floristics and monography are pursued, is the questioning of the continuing relevance of the Linnaean hierarchical structure of biological classification and proposals to replace it with a phylogenetic structure, and proposals to adopt phylogenetic species concepts. Both of these, however scientifically justified, would drastically affect the accessibility of the units of taxonomy to a large number of non-specialist users. In contrast to this, we are beginning to see in taxonomy policy-making, an increasing sensitivity to societal and ethical concerns that characterise "post-normal science". This includes the recognition of the need to command strong public identification such as response to user needs and concerns, and an acceptance that floristic and taxonomic work cannot be pursued as open-ended, long-term enterprises. There is a time limit imposed by human activities in destroying the very resource base of biodiversity that we are aiming to study.
10.2307/1223887|The international community of systematic botany is in the process of entering a networked, digital environment that, after initial development over the past five years, will dominate all aspects of scientific activity in the future. Emerging new technologies are transforming the Internet into a global neural network that presents systematic botany, and science in general, with future prospects that include remarkable opportunity and significant challenge. The products of systematic botany, previously generated locally as static, hardcopy documents, can now be presented as collaborative enterprises from distributed centers as high-content, dynamic data resources that are constantly updated and refined. In addition, these products can be made available to a global user community in multiple forms that can be targeted for different user groups. The emerging Internet standard of "usage equals value" could place the products of systematic botany in a position to draw public interest, usage, and--most importantly--support. However, opportunities inherent in the coming "digital transition" will not be realised if traditional, hardcopy-based, perspectives on collaboration, peer review, publication and "ownership" are retained. Scientific communities that are able to recognise new potentials and respond by establishing appropriate interactive protocols will enhance and advance their discipline in this new environment. They will also work to insure, via interaction and content review by professionals, that information available to the public is of the highest scientific quality.
10.2307/1223888|The monotypic genus Achyrothalamus has been conventionally distinguished from Erythrocephalum principally by the absence of a pappus and the presence of phyllaries with entire margins. However, a critical re-examination of 83 morphological and anatomical characters, and a detailed study of the pollen of the two genera, suggest that recognition of Achyrothalamus as a distinct genus is unjustified. We thus propose Achyrothalamus as a synonym of Erythrocephalum with the new combination E. marginatum.
10.2307/1223889|The relationships of the island species of Phylica and other genera in Phyliceae (Rhamnaceae) were evaluated using sequences for the plastid trnL intron, the trnL-F intergenic spacer and the internal transcribed spacers of nuclear ribosomal DNA. Both regions provided nearly identical phylogenetic patterns, so they were analysed as a combined matrix. The genera Nesiota and Noltea were found to be palaeoendemic species within the context of the tribe. The island species of Phylica formed a monophyletic group together with the widespread mainland species, P. paniculata. The plesiomorphic, generalist morphology of this group contrasts with the derived morphological characteristics of the majority of mainland species. However, the group occupies a derived position in the phylogenetic trees, thus indicating either a reversal or more likely the retention of these primitive traits.
10.2307/1223890|The seagrass family Zosteraceae may be divided into four groups of species on the basis of morphological and developmental evidence. It is proposed to treat each of these groups as a genus; this involves the elevation of Zosterella from subgeneric to generic rank as Nanozostera. The family thus now includes: Heterozostera (one sp.), Nanozostera (eight spp.), Phyllospadix (five spp.), and Zostera (four spp.). Molecular and morphological evidence suggests that Phyllospadix is the most divergent taxon, while Heterozostera and Nanozostera are the most closely related.
10.2307/1223891|Nassella sensu lato includes 116 species, making it one of the largest genera in tribe Stipeae. Argentina has the largest number of species, 72, with the greatest concentration being in the northwestern part of the country. Bolivia, Chile, and Uruguay have 26, 27, and 27 species, respectively. Other South American countries in which the genus is present are Brazil (18 species), Colombia (8), Ecuador (9), Paraguay (4), Peru (18), and Venezuela (2). Guatemala has two species, but Costa Rica only one. Mexico has eight native species, five of which also grow in the United States. One additional species grows in both the United States and Canada. Sixty species are known only from one country; one species, N. mexicana, grows in eight countries. Several new distribution records are documented: N. caespitosa, N. elata, N. leptothera and N. punensis for Bolivia, N. pauciciliata and N. spegazzinii for Brazil, N. airoides, N. argentinensis, N. spegazzinii for Paraguay, and N. tucumana (= N. asperifolia) for Peru. Three new combinations are presented: N. burkartii, N. ligularis, and N. quinqueciliata. Two recently transferred species, N. barrancaensis and N. brachychaeta, are excluded from the genus and N. asperifolia, N. bonariensis, and N. amethystina are placed in synonymy. Tables summarising the distribution of Nassella and its morphological variation are presented.
10.2307/1223892|In just the past decade molecular data have demonstrated that recurrent origins of polyploids appear to be the rule, rather than the exception, with well-documented examples for bryophytes, ferns, and angiosperms. However, Russian investigators seem to have embraced the possibility of recurrent polyploidy at a much earlier date than did other evolutionary biologists. The crossing studies conducted by Maria Rozanova (1934, 1938, 1946) on Rubus should be considered classic investigations of the process of allopolyploidisation. Unfortunately, however, scientists in the West remain unaware of this work because it was largely published in Russian. We review here these remarkable investigations, which revealed at an early date the complexities of polyploidisation. Rozanova demonstrated that the same polyploid species can form multiple times and in multiple ways; she also suggested that the same processes revealed in her crossing studies likely occurred in nature and could account for the morphological diversity observed in natural populations. Thus, although molecular data have recently revealed the high frequency and importance of independent origins of polyploid species, traditional crossing studies conducted in Rubus over 60 years ago actually provided an early suggestion of the possible prevalence of this process, as well as providing critical insights into the mechanisms of polyploidisation.
10.2307/1223894|A list of effectively published names of genera and subdivisions of genera included or formerly included in the genus Scleria is provided, together with their status and types. The following names are here typified: Hymenolytrum Schrad. ex Nees, Macrolomia Schrad. ex Nees, Mastigoscleria Nees, Omoscleria Nees, and Trachylomia Nees; Scleria sect. Foveolidia Raf., sect. Margaleia Raf., sect. Paniculatae Pax, and sect. Rugunia Raf.; Scleria ser. Polystachyae Benth. and ser. Subspicatae Benth.; Scleria [unranked] Spicatae Boeck., and [unranked] Tuberculatae Core. Moreover, two excluded names are typified: Cryptangium Schrad. ex Nees, and Scleria ser. Axillares Benth.
10.2307/1223895|As a consequence of recent disagreement on the choice of the type of Cuphea, a detailed account of the reasons for selecting C. decandra Ait. over C. viscosissima Jacq. is given. The original description of Cuphea P. Browne included inflorescence, floral, seed, and trichome characters and distribution information that apply most closely to C. decandra, which is defended as the correct type under Art. 10.2 of the Code. It is also confirmed that the illustration in the protologue of C. viscosissima, chosen by Molero & Zijlstra as lectotype of that name, supersedes the earlier designated neotype.
10.2307/1223896|Seven nomina nova proposed by Otto Kuntze in the illegitimate genus Anila are considered. The status of each in Indigofera is discussed briefly; new combinations are proposed for three of them and a changed author citation for a fourth.
10.2307/1223897|The nomenclatural difficulties associated with classifications that have misplaced rank-denoting terms are reviewed. Several examples (both real and hypothetical) of classifications with misplaced rank-denoting terms are discussed. A distinction is made between misplaced rank-denoting terms and colloquially (mis)used rank-denoting terms, and a discussion is provided on whether or not it may be useful to have such a distinction presented in the Code. In providing guidelines on how one should deal with the nomenclature of classifications that include misplaced rank-denoting terms, a "minimal invalidity" concept is introduced. A review is made on how Art. 33.7 might be reworded so as to provide clearer guidance when dealing with classifications that involve misplaced rank-denoting terms.
10.2307/1223898|Lectotypes, neotypes and epitypes are designated by 18 specialists for 102 previously untypified Linnaean plant names belonging to the family Lamiaceae (Labiatae). These newly proposed types support the current usage of the names concerned. Earlier but ineffective or supersedable type statements are discussed.
10.2307/1223899| All 26 names of species and infraspecific taxa included in Zahlbruckner's "Catalogus" and applicable to Erioderma are listed and typified with comments on their taxonomy and distribution. The author recognises only 10 of the 17 species accepted by Zahlbruckner, but also indicates the existence of more than 10 undescribed species, mainly in South America. One new combination E. leylandii subsp. velligerum (Tuck.) P. M. Jrg. (= E. chilense Mont.) is made. 
10.2307/1223900|Types for the names V. aragonensis Stroh, V. micrantha Hoffmanns. & Link, V. nummularia Gouan, V. orbiculata A. Kern., V. orsinitana Ten., V. ponae Gouan, V. rosea Desf., V. saturejoides Vis., V. tenuifolia Asso and V. teucrioides Boiss. & Heldr. are here designated.
10.2307/1223901|Lectotypes for the names V. biloba L., V. pectinata L., V. pilosa L., V. pseudochamaedrys Jacq., V. romana L., and V. urticifolia Jacq. are here designated. An epitype is also chosen in order to avoid misinterpretation of the name V. biloba. For V. fruticans Jacq. a neotype is designated.
10.2307/1223700|The Tree of Life represents the fundamental framework for ordering biological information. In this paper, we argue for concerted efforts to reconstruct the green plant clade of the Tree of Life, as well as the rest of the Tree, and suggest ways in which the Tree can be used further for inferring and testing hypotheses of evolution. We suggest characters, from DNA sequences to genomic characters, for use in reconstructing the phylogeny of plants. Challenges in data analysis must also be met, if we are to reconstruct the phylogeny of nearly half a billion species of green plants. Phyloinformatics, the storage, retrieval, and use of phylogenetic data and phylogenetic trees, must play an increasingly important role in plant systematics and the systematics community as a whole. Both functional and comparative genomics will benefit from integration with phylogenetic information, and these fields may provide new characters for phylogeny reconstruction. A synthetic view of plant phylogeny requires the incorporation of fossil; a major challenge facing paleobotanists and plant systematists is the integration of these disciplines. In sum, molecular systematics, through interfaces with many other fields, from genomics to computer science to paleobotany, will long remain an "unending synthesis".
10.2307/1223701|Traditionally population genetics and systematics have been separate fields, with distinct conceptual frameworks, tools, and statistics. Hennig drew a clear distinction between the reticulate genealogical relationships among individuals and populations on one hand, and the hierarchical phylogenetic relationships among divergent species or taxa on the other. For many plant species, such distinctions blur. The genetic structuring of plant populations is strongly affected by phylogenetic history, and the phylogenetic relationships among species are frequently confounded by gene migration between species. The identification of molecular markers that vary within species, as well as reductions in costs and time associated with DNA sequencing, have set the stage for a blending of the two fields. Haplotype variation at a non-recombining locus can be historically ordered to produce a gene genealogy. Genealogical analysis coupled with the theoretical framework of coalescence theory can be used to estimate the roles of migration, founder effects and range expansion during the formation and subsequent establishment of species. Such studies hold great promise for understanding the interplay of phylogenetic history and population level process in shaping distinct evolutionary lineages.
10.2307/1223702|When an examination of some aspects of the evolution of vascular land plants is made across broad sweeps of Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Tertiary time, three basic patterns occur in unrelated groups in vascular land plant evolution: independent evolution of similar morphologies, nearly contemporaneous evolution of similar structures and strategies, and repeated evolution of similar features or strategies at different times. Examples are given in non-flowering plants and also in the evolution of angiosperms. A database is presented to illustrate the presence of angiosperms in the Jurassic/Lower Cretaceous fossil record and the diversity and abundance of organs recovered from these early angiosperms. These data are presented as working documents with the anticipation that they may grow into a major database for interested scholars world-wide.
10.2307/1223703|In the historical context of plant systematics over the last 50 years, systematics is examined in terms of where it is now, where it is headed, where it should be, and how it should get there. Issues and concerns of the past decades are still with us today. Molecular systematics has become the over-arching field in systematics, but each of eight other areas (genome, chromosomes, morphology and anatomy, development, population biology, speciation, floristics and monography, nomenclature and classification) are evaluated. A revolution in systematics is not necessary for the next 50 years in plant systematics. What is needed is a re-mapping of our discipline that involves four elements for the future growth and health of botanical systematics: plant systematics and its utility, dialogue with other disciplines, multi-disciplinary training, and a pluralistic viewpoint.
10.2307/1223704|Studies of the genus Dicoma Cass. (Asteraceae, tribe Mutisieae) indicate that this taxon as currently defined is paraphyletic, and in fact comprises three groups showing marked morphological and anatomical differences. One of these groups is differentiated from Dicoma s.str. by a large number of characters relating to morphology and anatomy of phyllaries, corolla, anthers, style, cypsela, and testa. It is proposed that these species should be considered as a separate genus, for which the name Macledium Cass. has nomenclatural priority. A brief nomenclatural synopsis is presented, including synonyms and nomenclatural types for each taxon in this genus of 20 species.
10.2307/1223705|Sequences of the nrDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region were analysed for 29 representatives of Anthemis L. and six outgroup taxa of Anthemideae (Compositae) to study the delimitation and the infrageneric taxonomy of this large and widespread Eurasian and African genus. Species of Anthemis included all subgenera and sections traditionally used in supraspecific classifications of the genus. Maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML), and distance (neighbor joining, NJ) analyses were carried out for phylogenetic reconstructions. The results suggest that the genus, in its traditional circumscription, is not monophyletic due to the consistent placement of a member of Tripleurospermum amidst the Anthemis representatives. Subdivision of Anthemis into two subgenera (A. subg. Anthemis, A. subg. Cota) is supported, with the exception of the placement of A. sect. Chiae and sect. Odontostephanae which fall outside A. subg. Anthemis. Within A. subg. Anthemis, life form dependent delimitation of A. sect. Anthemis (annuals) against A. sect. Hiorthia (perennials) is not supported, whereas the monophyly of other sections (A. sect. Maruta, A. sect. Rascheyanae) is confirmed including the placement of Ammanthus Boiss. & Heldr. into Anthemis subg. Anthemis.
10.2307/1223706|Seventy-three plastid DNA sequences from the trnL-F region were used to infer phylogenetic relationships among Polygalaceae. The analysis indicates that Xanthophyllum is the sister group to the remainder of genera in Polygalaceae. Monophyly of tribes Polygaleae and Carpolobieae is corroborated, whereas monophyly of Moutabeae could not be confirmed. Although intergeneric relationships within Polygaleae are poorly resolved, most traditional genera are corroborated as monophyletic. However, Polygala and Bredemeyera s.l. form two exceptions and are grossly polyphyletic. Acanthocladus and Badiera (incl. Hebecarpa), taxa often assigned to Polygala, are more closely related to Bredemeyera s.str. than to other Polygala. Likewise, Bredemeyera s.l. is broadly polyphyletic since Comesperma and Bredemeyera colletioides (sect. Hualania) have their closest relatives among other genera. Furthermore, Hualania is also polyphyletic since Bredemeyera microphylla appears as the sister to the Hebecarpa--Badiera clade. Unlike a previous morphological analysis, Monnina is strongly supported as monophyletic by trnL-F data, but internal relationships are partly unresolved. Species of Polygala sensu Chodat have a tendency to group by geographical distribution rather than after traditional sectional affiliation. Thus, although resolution is poor, it is suspected that several sections of Polygala are not monophyletic and need to be recircumscribed.
10.2307/1223707| Hydrostachys, an enigmatic aquatic plant genus from Madagascar and southern to central Africa, has been suggested to be related to Lamiales based on embryology, whereas rbcL sequences have indicated a relationship with Hydrangeaceae (Cornales). We investigated these hypotheses by combining rbcL with atpB and ndhF sequences and increased taxon sampling in Hydrangeaceae compared to previous analyses. Rates and patterns of molecular evolution vary across ndhF with the 3 portion giving a different result than the 5 portion. The highly divergent sequences of Hydrostachys make phylogenetic placement difficult, but maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses of combined data sets agree in placing Hydrostachys within Hydrangeaceae, as do separate analyses of rbcL, atpB, and the 5 portion of ndhF. Few morphological and embryological characters support this relationship. 
10.2307/1223708|A satisfactory resolution of the current instability of generic concepts in the parmelioid lichens, and particularly Parmelia s.l., has not so far emerged from molecular studies. The rDNA ITS sequence has proven too variable and the rDNA SSU too conserved to provide satisfactory discrimination around the family and generic levels in Parmeliaceae s.l. Studies of 31 new sequences of species belonging to 30 genera in the family (including the type species of 21) are reported here. These demonstrate that the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) SSU region has the potential to play a major role in establishing the phylogeny and stabilising generic concepts in some of the world's most conspicuous lichens. Some clades identified appear to correlate with differences in cell wall carbohydrates, epicortical, conidial, and other features. The emerging groupings now need to be further tested by the inclusion of sequences from additional genera and species. Nomenclatural changes should not be made until further work has been carried out.
10.2307/1223710|No specimen of either of two Vahl (1802) taxa, Fucus cupressoides and F. taxifolia, that could represent the holotypes of these names was indicated unambiguously in the protologues. Almost 200 years later, due largely to the lack of critical labelling of original herbarium specimens, it has not been possible to distinguish conclusively any original material of the two taxa. As a result of detailed consideration of numerous specimens in many herbaria, appropriate material for neotypification has been identified: both specimens are at Copenhagen (C), Type No. A-826 (C 31688) for C. cupressoides and Type No. A-1086 (C 27833) for C. taxifolia.
10.2307/1223711| The lichenised fungus Echinoplaca vezdana from the Philippines is described and illustrated. It has a comparatively large thallus, large apothecia, and 2-4 muriform ascospores per ascus. The new taxon is closely related to E. diffluens, which differs in having transversely septate ascospores. The two species form another pair of morphologically similar taxa differing in ascospore types of which five were previously known. Echinoplaca vezdana is dedicated to Antonn Vzda, one of the outstanding lichen taxonomists of the 20th century, on the occasion of his recent 80th birthday. 
10.2307/1223712|The holotype of Selaginella novae-hollandiae is located, and the history of the original material is discussed.
10.2307/1223713|P. Durand (1808) described three species of Chloris Sw. (Poaceae) for the Philippines. In fact they are American: C. hispida P. Durand is Bouteloua hirsuta Lag., C. peregrina P. Durand is C. rufescens Lag., and C. procumbens P. Durand is Bouteloua prostrata Lag. The likely modern identities of the other six Chloris species treated in the work are noted.
10.2307/1223714| The name Epipactis kleinii, nom. nov., is proposed as an avowed substitute for E. parviflora (A. & C. Niesch.) E. Klein, an illegitimate later homonym of E. parviflora (Blume) A. A. Eaton ( Neottia parviflora Blume, non Sm.), itself an illegitimate name which is presently treated as synonym of Goodyera procera (Ker Gawl.) Hook. A brief history is presented of the names concerned, to justify the new proposal. 
10.2307/1223715|The genus Suaeda (Chenopodiaceae) has been divided historically into two to eight sections or between two and seven genera. We review the sectional nomenclature of Suaeda to clarify priorities of sectional and generic names and to determine or assign types for each of these. The nomenclatural history of Suaeda has been complicated by past misapplication of the name S. fruticosa to the generic type, S. vera Forssk. ex J. F. Gmel., and incorrect author attribution as "Suaeda fruticosa (L.) Forssk.", as well as confusion with the species correctly called S. fruticosa Forssk. ex J. F. Gmel. The generic type, Suaeda vera, is also the type of S. sect. Chenopodina Moq. (S. sect. Lachnostigma Iljin, nom. superfl.), which is correctly named S. sect. Suaeda. Suaeda fruticosa is placed in S. sect. Salsina Moq. Suaeda sect. Brezia (Moq.) Volk. is reinstated over S. sect. Heterosperma Iljin, and S. sect. Schoberia (C. A. Mey.) Volk. is reinstated over S. sect. Conosperma Iljin. Other currently accepted sectional epithets include Limbogermen Iljin, Physophora Iljin, Schanginia (C. A. Mey.) Volk., Macrosuaeda Tsvelev, and Immersa Townsend. Types are designated for S. sect. Limbogermen Iljin, S. sect. Salsina Moq., and S. sect. Schoberia (C. A. Mey.) Volk. and for the generic name Schoberia C. A. Mey. Suaeda sect. Platystigma Iljin is placed in synonymy under S. sect. Suaeda. Delineations of sections largely follow Iljin [1936. Sovietsk. Bot. 1936(5): 39-49], whose treatment has been generally supported by recent data on the distribution of C
10.2307/1223716|Ancistrocactus, a name first published by Britton and Rose in 1923, is best treated as based on Schumann's "Echinocactus subg. Ancistrocactus", not as the name of a new genus. Consequently, Britton and Rose's original type designation cannot stand, nor can the next subsequent published choice by Taylor in 1979, as neither is of an element included in Schumann's protologue. Echinocactus scheeri Salm-Dyck is here proposed to provide the type of both the subgeneric and generic name. This choice conforms to the provisions of the ICBN and does not impinge on the application of the name Ancistrocactus, which, under the narrow generic concept currently again accepted by some, remains correct for Britton & Rose's genus.
10.2307/1223717| Notocactus, a name first published by Fri in 1928, was clearly, if implicitly, based on Schumann's "Echinocactus subg. Notocactus". The first type designation for the generic name and its subgeneric basionym was by Backeberg in 1938. It conforms to current usage and to the provisions of the Code and must stand. A later designation, based on the assumption that Fri had described a new genus, has no standing; it would have made Notocactus a homotypic earlier synonym of Eriocactus Backeb. (nom. cons. prop. against Eriocephalus Backeb.). More than 70 new combinations and at least three generic names published by Berger in 1929 under a narrow generic concept, differing from the wide concept he adopted in the main body of his book, are to be considered as alternative names accepted and validly published by him in the index to his book. They include 13 new combinations under Notocactus. 
10.2307/1223718|The lectotype of Diospyros cayennensis A. DC. (Ebenaceae) is designated here as a specimen collected by J. Martin in French Guiana. As a result, D. cayennensis becomes the correct name for what has been known as D. ierensis Britton.
10.2307/1223721|The Nomenclature Section of the XVI International Botanical Congress authorised the revision of Appendix IIB of the "International Code of Botanical Nomenclature." We provide a list of the entries which have been modified editorially in the "Saint Louis Code."
10.2307/1224716|Allozyme variation was examined within and among three species of Lemna (Lemnaceae) that have been viewed as closely related based on morphological and DNA sequence data. These include L. aequinoctialis, L. perpusilla, and L. tenera, with the former two species the only members of sect. Alatae and the latter the sole species of sect. Biformes. Lemna aequinoctialis is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions whereas the other two species have much narrower distributions. Sampling from one population of L. aequinoctialis revealed several multilocus genotypes but a deficiency of heterozygotes, which agrees with observations that the species can self-fertilise and produce seed in addition to reproducing clonally. Two series of localized populations revealed several multilocus genotypes in each group, but no heterozygotes were detected at any of the variable loci. Twenty single clones from much of the geographic range of L. aequinoctialis contain the same alleles detected in the local populations; no pattern of large-scale geographic variation was detected. Allozyme data support the recognition of L. perpusilla as distinct from L. aequinoctialis, but the two species share much higher identities at allozyme loci than either does with any other species of Lemna, thus agreeing with morphological and plastid DNA sequence data indicating that the two are closely related yet distinct species. Lemna tenera shares very low allozyme identities with L. aequinoctialis and L. perpusilla. Neither allozymes nor plastid sequences support the hypothesis that L. perpusilla is a hybrid between L. aequinoctialis and L. turionifera. Molecular data indicate that the three species form a strongly supported monophyletic group, with the common ancestor of Lemna tenera and L. aequinoctialis-L. perpusilla having diverged first, much later divergence occurring between the common ancestor of L. aequinoctialis and L. perpusilla.
10.2307/1224717|Phylogenetic relationships within the genus Helleborus (Ranunculaceae) were evaluated with analyses of plastid trnL-F and partial matK and nuclear ITS DNA sequences for all 16 currently recognised species in addition to several subspecies and geographical variants. The molecular study provides strong support for the monophyly of Helleborus. However, both traditional divisions of the genus, into two groups (Caulescentes and Scapigeri) or two subgenera (Helleborastrum and Helleborus), are refuted. All six currently recognised sections (Dicarpon, Chenopus, Griphopus, Helleborus, Helleborastrum, and Syncarpus) are monophyletic, four by default because they are monospecific. Section Dicarpon (H. thibetanus) is strongly supported as sister group to section Helleborastrum and could therefore be sunk into that section. Relationships between this pair of sections and the other sections are, however, not clear. At the specific level, all species which are clearly distinct morphologically are also distinct in terms of molecular divergence, but relationships between the poorly differentiated species in section Helleborastrum are not resolved with any degree of support. Using a molecular clock based on matK sequence divergence, the disjunction of H. thibetanus and section Helleborastrum between East Asia and the Mediterranean is tentatively dated at approximately 23 million years (middle Miocene), which corresponds well with the geological history of the area where H. thibetanus occurs.
10.2307/1224718|Mankyua chejuense gen. & sp. nov. (Ophioglossaceae) is described from a lowland swampy area of Cheju Island off the south coast of the Korean Peninsula. The diagnostic characters include: (1) ternately divided compound trophophore; (2) linear and fleshy sporophore branched at base; and (3) creeping rhizome with proliferous roots. The new fern is somewhat morphologically related to Helminthostachys and Ophioglossum, but distinct enough to merit generic status.
10.2307/1224719|The Austral biota reveals many links between Australasia and South America that have challenged biogeographers for many years. Nothofagus, the Southern Beech, is probably the classical example. With the general acceptance of continental drift, the break-up of Gondwana is regarded as primarily responsible for many disjunct patterns expressed in the Southern Hemisphere biota. Vicariance biogeography is the principal tool used to investigate biogeographic patterns of extant plant groups, resulting in areagrams or general area cladograms. These are often at odds with current geological knowledge, and on this basis, alternative hypotheses of area relationships and geological history have, therefore, been suggested. One such areagram was recently advocated by Linder & Crisp (1995) in a biogeographic analysis of Nothofagus. Three explanations, often in combination, account for incongruence: long-distance dispersals, extinctions, and erroneous geological models. All of these parameters ought to be considered in the analysis. Here we report the result of a historical biogeographic analysis of Nothofagus where we compare the reconciled trees between a well-supported Nothofagus phylogeny and two geological hypotheses: (1) the current view of Gondwana break-up, and (2) the areagram by Linder & Crisp. Our analysis makes use of extant and extinct taxa, as well as the assumption of long-distance dispersals as defined by maximized vicariance. Our results show that Nothofagus existed prior to the break-up of Gondwana and, most importantly, its present distribution supports, and is dependent upon, the traditional break-up sequence of East Gondwana, compatible with three vicariance events. The areagram, conceived as an alternative geological hypothesis, presents a more parsimonious solution, but fails to explain numerous past distributions in areas such as Antarctica, South America, and Tasmania. We therefore recommend a conservative approach to use (general) areagrams in historical biogeography.
10.2307/1224720|Previous molecular sequence and restriction site data have confirmed subfamily Barnadesioideae as basal within Asteraceae. The subfamily consists of 88 species in nine genera: Arnaldoa, Barnadesia, Chuquiraga, Dasyphyllum, Doniophyton, Duseniella, Fulcaldea, Huarpea, and Schlechtendalia. Two morphological cladistic analyses among genera or subgeneric groups within this subfamily have been completed previously, with contrasting results. Because of the importance of understanding relationships in this group of early Asteraceae, especially for insights on character evolution within the family, comprehensive morphological cladistic analyses were conducted at the specific level. Initial investigations utilising 31 characters with all 88 species led eventually to curtailed studies with 52 species. Five different outgroup hypotheses were employed: Acicarpha laxa, A. spathulata, Calycera leucanthema, C. spinulosa (all Calyceraceae), and Schlechtendalia luzulaefolia (Barnadesioideae; as functional outgroup). The results confirm Schlechtendalia as basal within Barnadesioideae. Monophyly is also confirmed for all genera, sections Chuquiraga and Acanthophyllae of Chuquiraga, and subgenus Archidasyphyllum of Dasyphyllum. All cladograms show two major groups (although statistical support values are low): (1) Chuquiraga, Doniophyton and Duseniella; and (2) Arnaldoa, Dasyphyllum, Fulcaldea, Huarpea and Barnadesia. Although bilabiate (4 + 1) corollas occur in Schlechtendalia, tubular corollas are believed plesiomorphic for the subfamily because they are pervasive in Calyceraceae as well as in all other basal Barnadesioideae. Pollen with no shallow depressions also are hypothesised as plesiomorphic for Barnadesioideae, even though one depression occurs in Schlechtendalia. A southern South American origin of Barnadesioideae (and the entire family) is re-emphasised. The previously hypothesised ancient lineage of Dasyphyllum subg. Archidasyphyllum, consisting of large trees, appears more derived in the new analyses.
10.2307/1224721|The liverwort genus Cyrtolejeunea A. Evans is reduced to synonymy under Cheilolejeunea (Spruce) Schiffn. because of the existence of a series of intermediate species, including Cheilolejeunea insecta Grolle & Gradst. sp. nov. from Bolivia and Brazil and Cheilolejeunea chenii R. L. Zhu & M. L. So from eastern China. The new combinations, Cheilolejeunea holostipa (Spruce) Grolle & R. L. Zhu comb. nov. and C. suzannensis (Grolle) Grolle & R. L. Zhu comb. nov., are proposed.
10.2307/1224722|Taxonomic interpretations of species or other taxa may vary considerably among authors. A database program called TaxLink has been developed, which allows for a detailed visualisation of comparisons between different taxonomic concepts. The basic entities of TaxLink are "taxonyms" (= potential taxa; Berendsohn, 1995). TaxLink may store taxonyms with their references, synonyms, relationships between taxonyms, and nomenclatural status of names. Information can be vizualised on screen, printed, and retrieved as textdocument in Microsoft Word format.
10.2307/1224725|The later homonym Orthotheca P. Corsin, 1951 [fossil foliage] (non S. E. Bridel, 1827 [Musci] nec Pichon, 1946 [Bignoniaceae]) is replaced by a new generic name Corsinopteris. All four species described under Orthotheca P. Corsin. are transferred to the new genus.
10.2307/1224726|After a close examination of the historical aspects of the typification of Sesleria caerulea, the correct names of the two allied species of the group are established as being S. caerulea (L.) Ard. and S. uliginosa Opiz. This permits unambiguous lectotypification of Sesleria. In addition, the types of the names S. albicans and S. uliginosa are designated.
10.2307/1224727|New taxa and combinations are presented to be included in the prepared treatment of Juncaceae in the Flora of the World. A new section, Luzula sect. Atlanticae, and a new species, Luzula indica, are described, and three new combinations are made: Luzula nipponica (Satake) Kirschner & Miyamoto, L. lutescens (Koidzumi) Kirschner & Miyamoto, and Luzula alpino-pilosa subsp. deflexa (Kozuharov) Kirschner. A new name, Juncus meianthus K. Wilson is proposed for a later homonym, J. gracilis R. Br. The name Luzula acuminata Raf. is neotypified in order to retain its current usage.
10.2307/1224728|In preparing a revision of the genera Lantana L. and Lippia L. in Brazil, 19 species names and 1 varietal name were found to require typification. These are typified in the present paper, 17 by lectotypes and three by neotypes.
10.2307/1224729|Quereuxia Krysht. ex Baikovskaja is the correct name for a morphogenus of leaves and leaf rosettes belonging to an aquatic angiosperm of Late Cretaceous to Palaeocene age in North America and Eurasia and must be accepted instead of its illegitimate junior synonym, Trapago McIver & Basinger. In addition, the name Jonquieria Krassilov, though based on a separate type, falls well within the circumscription of Quereuxia and is here regarded as another later synonym, which requires the new combination Quereuxia vachrameevii (Krassilov) L. J. Hickey.
10.2307/1224730| Entodon challengeri (Paris) Cardot is demonstrated to be the correct name for the taxon called E. compressus Mll. Hal. by Mizushima and by Crum and Anderson in their revisions and floristic account, respectively. Although validly published, Entodon compressus Mll. Hal. ex Cardot (1899) is shown to be an illegitimate later homonym of E. compressus (Hedw.) Mll. Hal. (1845), itself a synonym of Entodon cladorrhizans (Hedw.) Mll. Hal. (1845).

10.2307/1224733| It is demonstrated that Prumnopitys andina (Poepp. ex Endl.) de Laub. (Podocarpaceae) is the correct name for the Chilean conifer, known locally as "lleuque", which was recently renamed Prumnopitys spicata (Poepp.) Molloy & Muoz-Schick. Podocarpus spicatus R. Br. ex Mirb., a name that applies to the New Zealand species, Prumnopitys taxifolia (Sol. ex D. Don) de Laub. (based on Dacrydium taxifolium Sol. ex D. Don), commonly called "matai" or black pine, is validly published, and makes Pod. spicatus Poepp., upon which Molloy & Muoz-Schick based their new combination, illegitimate. Moreover, if Podocarpus L'Hr. ex Pers. is circumscribed broadly to include Prumnopitys Phil., the epithets of two of the three species discussed in this paper must be changed from those used legitimately under Prumnopitys. Pod. spicatus R. Br. ex Mirb. is the only available name for that species (matai) in Podocarpus, because Pod. taxifolius Kunth, applicable to a tropical South American species, Prumnopitys montana (Humb., Bonpl. & Kunth. ex Willd.) de Laub. (known locally as "chaquiro"), antedates Dacrydium taxifolium D. Don, preventing the use of Don's epithet in Podocarpus. Chaquiro, currently called Pr. montana, would become Pod. taxifolius Kunth. Full synonymies of the names for the Chilean and New Zealand species and a limited synonymy for that of the tropical South American taxon are given. 
10.2307/1224734|Morphological studies of Actinoseris (Endl.) Cabrera and Gochnatia Kunth indicate that the species currently included in Gochnatia sect. Discoseris Cabrera should be transferred to Actinoseris. With this new circumscription, Richterago Kuntze is the correct generic name, having priority over Actinoseris. This paper presents a morphological description of Richterago and a nomenclatural treatment with seven new combinations.
10.2307/1224735|Lisianthius acuminatus Perkins from Veracruz, Mexico is a later homonym of Lisianthius acuminatus Desr., which is a synonym of Wurdackanthus frigidus (Sw.) Maguire & B. M. Boom from the Lesser Antilles. Therefore, Lisianthius acuminatus Perkins is here renamed Lisianthius perkinsiae Struwe & Weaver, nom. nov.
10.2307/1224736|While preparing a review of the family Podostemaceae, we have found it necessary to change the name of some species. Following rules of priority, Crenias K. P. J. Sprengel replaces Mniopsis Martius. No convincing reasons can be found to maintain the monotypic genera Hydrobryopsis, Malaccotristicha, Synstylis and Torrenticola; they are merged in their sister genera Zeylanidium, Tristicha, Hydrobryum and Cladopus, respectively. On morphological grounds Polypleurella micranthera is transferred to Hydrobryum and Polypleurum submersa is transferred to Saxicolella.
10.2307/1224737|A thorough investigation of relevant nomenclatural types and descriptions reveals that the name Echinacea purpurea (L.) Moench, which was lectotypified by McGregor in 1968, has been consistently misapplied since 1903 to a taxon distinctly different from that of its modern lectotype and of the original Linnaean concept. Linnaeus's original concept of Rudbeckia purpurea, maintained by Candolle as Echinacea purpurea when he segregated E. serotina (Nutt.) DC., is the species now known as E. laevigata (C. L. Boynton & Beadle) S. F. Blake. Technically, therefore, the correct name for the species currently called E. laevigata is E. purpurea (L.) Moench, and the correct name for the species currently called E. purpurea is E. serotina (Nutt.) DC., for which a lectotype is designated. Conservation of the name E. purpurea in the sense of its current application, which also preserves the usage of E. laevigata, is proposed in a separate article (see Binns & al., p. 1199, this issue).
10.2307/1224738|The type of Dipentodon sinicus Dunn was not indicated when the name was first published, and a lectotype is now designated. The species is very well known, representing a monospecific family, Dipentodontaceae.
10.2307/1224752|Basic understanding of the higher plant resources of the world for the successful management of biodiversity requires international collaboration and the setting up of a global taxonomic database. Botanists at all levels should be involved in the taxonomic work, and biologists and conservationists need to be actively aware of the need for such work on a global basis. The database must include census, descriptive, and identification aspects. At present, existing available information is haphazardly distributed on library shelves and inadequately organised. Published data on threatened species have been shown to be hopelessly inaccurate. National and regional Floras may often portray a false perspective of the plants they include. The world's botanists have to organise themselves to pool their information, and substantial international funding is needed to support this. The Species Plantarum Project, set up in 1995 under the International Organisation for Plant Information affiliated to the International Union of Biological Sciences (IUBS), aims to overcome "the taxonomic impediment", and is currently seeking appropriate funding. It responds to the priorities highlighted in the work programme being developed under the Global Taxonomy Initiative of the Convention on Biological Diversity. The project has an international Steering Committee representing all regions of the world, and aims to develop a further network of collaborators. Publication of data will be in both hard copy and electronic form. Instructions to contributors and accounts of five relatively small families have already been published in hard copy, and accounts of two further families totalling nearly 1000 species are in press. Future plans emphasise the need for capacity building in floristic work throughout the world. The project now invites the collaboration of taxonomists throughout the community, but the future of the project is dependent on funding being made available.
10.2307/1554958|Linnaeus organised almost everything to which he put his mind and was the first to systematically apply a binomial system to all of nature. The philosophy underlying his system of nature is that of a ladder (pyramid) leading from stones, the lowest (furthest from Man), to animals, with Man, created in the image of God, being the highest. The classification functioned like a two-dimensional map, characters of taxa being like latitude and longitude with a hierarchy of precision. It was of value in an age of discovery, although his classifications of stones and plants had short lives. The binomial system of naming, although not considered important by Linnaeus, was important in separating diagnoses/descriptions of taxa from the names of taxa. It is hoped that new philosophies will maintain the distinction between things named and their names.
10.2307/1554959|The naming systems of Linnaeus and Bentham in particular are examined to clarify the relationships between naming and ideas of relationships. Linnaean binomials were adopted largely for practical reasons. Furthermore, Linnaeus proposed his names in the context of system, putting organisms in groups of 10. This allowed botanists of moderate capabilities to know at least the genera. Although binomials are names of taxa of the two lowest levels of a rank hierarchy, much of Linnaeus' work does not fit easily in the currently widely accepted view of Linnaeus as a hard-bitten essentialist. Neither Lamarck nor the later Bentham believed in a rank hierarchy, although to name organisms both used what is here called a flagged hierarchy: name terminations indicating only a set of inclusion relationships, not ranks of nature implied by a rank hierarchy. Bentham was clear that the adoption of a flagged hierarchy with groups of a particular size in the Genera plantarum was to facilitate botanists' understanding of the system as a whole. Systematists like Bentham and Linnaeus managed information and presented classification systems simultaneously. I conclude that the lower level of Linnaeus' hierarchy is a special case of the noun + adjective combination that pervade folk classifications in particular and human language in general. Linking essentialism and "Linnaean" nomenclature is at best a red herring, thus few nineteenth-century botanists believed in a fully-developed rank hierarchy. Naming hierarchies are mostly such that at each level members belong to only one group, and this is at a higher level; most such hierarchies are fairly shallow. Historically, uninomials have seemed more attractive when generic limits were in flux, but suboptimal when relationships were more stable. Naming systems in general incorporate a substantial element of convention, emphasizing particular numbers of groups and groups of particular size; this facilitates comprehension and communication. Similar conventions will be needed whatever naming system is used.
10.2307/1554960|This paper assesses how the debate between the PhyloCode and Linnaean nomenclature and ranked classifications relates to biological inventory and monographic activities. I propose that there is a considerable gap between the overall inventory of biological resources and the better phylogenetic knowledge of certain groups. Since ranks and binomials are a useful societal convention, and alternative ways exist of dealing with improved phylogenetic knowledge without abandoning the Linnaean hierarchy, it could be counterproductive to the field as a whole to embark upon an alternative nomenclature system such as the PhyloCode at this time.
10.2307/1554961|Over the past 50 years it has been pointed out with increasing frequency that our traditional Linnaean system of classification and nomenclature is incompatible with a phylogenetic system which recognises only monophyletic groups. Dividing up an evolutionary tree into mutually exclusive families, genera, and species which are all monophyletic is a logical impossibility. Darwin had emphasised that evolution is descent with modification. The rise of cladistic thinking in the last 40 years has promoted an obsession with monophyletic taxa, with classification based solely on descent at the expense of modification. Despite strong psychological pressures on a generation of biologists who have been brought up on the dogma of monophyly, the Hennigian view of classification is now increasingly seen as illogical and out-of-date. Some are therefore supporting the PhyloCode, which is based on a logical position but is impractical for general purpose classification and communication since it recognises no ranks and abandons binomials. Others still cling to the nonsensical concept of recognising families, genera, species, etc., and all being monophyletic. Linnaean classification is the optimal tool for cataloguing biodiversity and will inevitably be maintained, but this requires recognition of paraphyletic taxa and some rethinking of the practice and purposes of biological classification. Those who want a classification to recognise only monophyletic taxa should adopt an appropriate nomenclatural system such as is offered by the PhyloCode. To do otherwise will tend to lead to bad taxonomy.
10.2307/1554962|The PhyloCode suggests that by adopting its rules, taxonomists will gain clarity, uniqueness and stability compared with the use of Linnaean Taxonomy. This claim is questioned here by suggesting (1) that replacing the Types of Linnaean Taxonomy with the Specifiers of PhyloCode increases the complexity of decisions which have to be made, some of which go beyond nomenclature; (2) deciding which PhyloCode definition of a name to use demands knowledge of phylogenetic support and likelihood of future changes in ideas of relationships; (3) Phylogenetic Nomenclature will have limited value because it names only monophyletic groups, and (4) confusion over naming taxa is not avoided by the PhyloCode and can lead to problems when used alongside Linnaean Taxonomy. The problems concerning Linnaean rank and raised by Phylogenetic Nomenclature are upheld.
10.2307/1554963|Xerophyta seinei Behnke, K. Kramer & E. Hummel sp. nov. (Velloziaceae), a new species from the Rhodes Matopos National Park in southwestern Zimbabwe, is distinguished by persistent leaf blades concealing the stems, an apex of dark-green leaves with lustrous and glutinous upper surfaces, and a lamina with glands on both surfaces and with non-transcurrent vascular bundles. Its distinctness from other Xerophyta species is also substantiated by specific sieve-element plastids (with a rectangular protein crystal in addition to the angular ones common to Velloziaceae) and by an rbcL-analysis. The morphology and leaf anatomy of the new species are compared to those of other members of the family and, in particular, of Xerophyta species known from the area.
10.2307/1554964| The efficiency of classical metric descriptors (MDs), normalised elliptic Fourier coefficients (EFCs), and the power series of normalised elliptic Fourier coefficients (PEFCs) in revealing variation in leaf shape was evaluated and compared for species in the genus Chaenomeles, using canonical variates analyses (CVAs) and reclassification tests. For EFCs 30 harmonics (and for PEFCs 40 harmonics) were needed to achieve 100% correct reassignment of plants. By contrast, MDs were considerably less efficient and only 87%, 77% and 66% of the plants were correctly reassigned to species, populations, and maternal families, respectively. Furthermore, when compared with data based on molecular random amplified polymorphic DNA markers (RAPDs), PEFCs produced the most concordant data sets as revealed by cluster analyses. To obtain comparable estimates of variability and differentiation, the AMOVA approach was used both for molecular data and, as a novelty, for quantitative morphometric data. The variation was partitioned by hierarchical extraction of variance components from matrices of standardised squared Euclidean distances, and differentiation estimates were obtained as -statistics. All descriptor sets partitioned the variance in a similar way. Surprisingly high correlations were found between RAPDs and elliptic Fourier transforms for the among-family estimates of variance components (RAPDs vs. PEFCs: 0.89, P = 0.003; RAPDs vs. EFCs: 0.86, P = 0.006). In contrast, only a moderate correlation was found between RAPDs and MDs (0.71, P = 0.049). This may indicate that shape per se (the size component excluded) is a less biased estimator of genetic variation than metric leaf descriptors in the genus Chaenomeles. Estimates of population differentiation based on EFCs and PEFCs were always lower than differentiation estimates based on RAPDs, whereas the differentiation estimates based on MDs were in general higher than estimates based on RAPDs, except for one species including hybrid populations. 
10.2307/1554965| The phylogenetic relationships of Isotes (Isotaceae) were investigated by means of a cladistic analysis using plastid rbcL sequences and a representative sample of 18 species. The analysis supports a basal split in Isotes separating two main groups, one including aquatic species from South America (I. bradei and I. amazonica) and West Africa (I. kersii and I. schweinfurthii), and the other including aquatic, amphibious and terrestrial species representing all major continents. Higher level relationships remain unresolved, but supported groups do conflict with previous morphology-based hypotheses. Comparatively low levels of sequence divergence indicate that the use of more rapidly evolving regions will be required to resolve higher level relationships. The phylogenetically isolated nature of Isotes will in such analyses make standard outgroup comparisons problematic, and results presented here will in this respect prove important by providing support for choosing among alternative rooting options. 
10.2307/1554966|The internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) of 18S-26S nuclear ribosomal DNA were newly sequenced for eight species of Umbelliferae (six species from subfamily Saniculoideae: Actinolema macrolema, Astrantia minor, Eryngium giganteum, E. coeruleum, Hacquetia epipactis, and Lagoecia cuminoides, two species from subfamily Hydrocotyloideae: Dickinsia hydrocotyloides and Azorella trifurcata), as well as Hohenackeria exscapa, a species of uncertain position in the family. Phylogenetic analyses of new data, plus previously reported sequences of 52 other species using neighbor-joining, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood methods yielded similar results: (1) Actinolema is sister to Astrantia corresponding to Drude's treatments; (2) in Astrantia, molecular divergence is revealed between sects. Astrantiella (A. minor) and Astrantia (A. major, A. maxima); (3) Eryngium appears to be paraphyletic; (4) Hacquetia might be treated as a part of Sanicula; and (5) Lagoecia is very distant from all other Saniculoideae and close to some genera of Apioideae. Our results correspond to matK data previously published: (1) Hohenackeria forms a clade with Bupleurum, in a position near the base of the Apioideae tree; (2) Azorella is sister to a large cluster uniting all Saniculoideae and Apioideae, being slightly closer to them than to the Hydrocotyle-Araliaceae clade; (3) Dickinsia is very distant from phenetically similar Hydrocotyle, falling within a large cluster of Apioideae, but also including Lagoecia and Naufraga.
10.2307/1554967|Analyses of morphological and molecular characters for Dioscoreales Hook. f. (Chase & al., 1995b; Caddick & al., 2000a; Caddick & al., 2002) have redefined the order, which now comprises three families, Burmanniaceae, Dioscoreaceae, and Nartheciaceae. Since recent analyses of morphological and molecular data sets (Caddick & al., 2002) have indicated well-supported relationships within Dioscoreaceae R. Br., a formal reclassification of the family is presented here. Dioscoreaceae now contain four distinct genera, Dioscorea, Stenomeris, Tacca (previously in Taccaceae), and Trichopus. The Malagasy endemic Avetra sempervirens is close sister to Trichopus zeylanicus, and is here reclassified as a second species of this genus. The dioecious Dioscoreaceae genera, Borderea, Epipetrum, Nanarepenta, Rajania, Tamus, and Testudinaria, are nested within Dioscorea in phylogenetic analyses (Caddick & al., 2002), and are therefore sunk into it.
10.2307/1554968|Results from a previous broad-scale analysis employing trnL-trnF sequence data for 168 Hypnalean and 11 Hookerialean taxa, and an analysis employing two chloroplast regions, trnL-trnF and atpB-rbcL, one nuclear region, the internal transcribed spacers of 18S-26S rDNA, plus 68 morphological characters for a reduced data set of 54 Hypnalean taxa, were used to circumscribe Amblystegiaceae. The analyses provided two well-supported main clades including taxa traditionally included in Amblystegiaceae s.l. and recognized as Amblystegiaceae s.str. [Anacamptodon, Amblystegium, Campyliadelphus, Campylium, Cratoneuron, Cratoneuropsis, Drepanocladus s.str., Gradsteinia, Hygrohypnum s.str. (including the type species, H. luridum, but excluding a number of other species previously accommodated in the genus), Hypnobartlettia, Leptodictyum, Palustriella, Pseudo-calliergon, and Serpoleskea] and Calliergonaceae stat. nov. (Calliergon, Hamatocaulis, Loeskypnum, Straminergon, and Warnstorfia). Scorpidium and "Hygrohypnum" ochraceum were closely related to Calliergonaceae but were not included in the family because of the lack of support. All these genera but Anacamptodon have previously been included in Amblystegiaceae s.l. The sporophytic features of Anacamptodon, which contrast with those of all the other members of Amblystegiaceae, are interpreted as adaptations to an epiphytic habitat and suggest, together with other recent taxonomic works in Hookeriales, that characters related to sporophytic specializations are among the most homoplastic. Several other taxa (Calliergonella, Campylophyllum, Conardia, Donrichardsia, "Hygrohypnum" smithii, Platydictya, Sanionia), previously included in Amblystegiaceae s.l., appeared more closely related to other Hypnalean families. Recircumscribed Amblystegiaceae, and several clades within the family, have no identifiable morphological synapomorphies. A new system of classification for recircumscribed Amblystegiaceae, including morphological delimitation of presented clades based on maximum likelihood reconstruction of ancestral character states, is proposed and appropriate nomenclatural changes made.
10.2307/1554969|Grimmia herzogii Broth. recently became the centre of a controversy among specialists who consider it separate from or synonymous with G. longirostris Hook. Cluster and ordination analyses have shown that by detailed morphological study, specimens with small ovate to ovate-lanceolate leaves and sinuous setae belong in G. herzogii. Those with comparatively large leaves and straight setae correspond to the concept of G. longirostris and include G. nigella Herz., a species described from heterogeneous materials.
10.2307/1554970|Types of databases commonly used for handling taxonomic data are compared. It is shown that none of the existing types of databases fully support the requirements of taxonomic data. The results of this comparison provide a rationale for the design and implementation of a new database system based on an Extended Object-Oriented model. The new model, the Prometheus Object-Oriented Model (POOM) and its query language Prometheus Object-Oriented Language (POOL), are discussed in relation to the requirements of taxonomic data and the Prometheus Taxonomic Data Model. POOM provides the ability to represent the semantics of relationships between data. This allows us to build the type of graph structures that are found in taxonomic hierarchies. In addition, the system can query and manipulate these graphs (POOL). These features have been used to improve the original Prometheus Taxonomic Data Model. These improvements and the advantages they offer are described and discussed.
10.2307/1554971|The effects of standard parsimony and three-item statement analysis, two different approaches to cladistics, are examined relative to a series of matrices where plesiomorphic values in one taxon are increased in a regular fashion. Analyses of these matrices suggest that standard parsimony is less sensitive to these changes than three-item statement analysis.
10.2307/1554973|Upon comparison with recent monographs of Juncaceae and Potamogetonaceae, the 1997 IUCN Red List of Threatened Plants is shown to be an inadequate information source for conservation decisions. A substantial proportion of names listed in the IUCN RL represent synonyms, often belonging to widespread taxa, or remain doubtful taxonomically. If a new Red List is derived from the two new monographic accounts, and compared with the 1997 IUCN RL, the correct data from the latter represent 10-25% of the former. It may concluded that the overall accuracy of the IUCN list is rather low. The importance of global taxonomic monographs as a source of basic data for the accurate compilation of Red Lists is stressed.
10.2307/1554974|The Conference of Parties (COP) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) has recognised the currently existing taxonomic impediment to ensure the conservation and management of the world's biodiversity. In response, COP has formulated the concept of a Global Taxonomy Initiative (GTI) to promote a concerted effort among international funding agencies, national and sub-national governments, and non-governmental bodies. The GTI Africa Regional Workshop was held at the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden, Claremont, Cape Town, South Africa, from 27 February to 1 March 2001. The Workshop was attended by a total of 43 delegates, representing 32 countries (23 African) and 36 institutions or organisations. The Kirstenbosch Declaration was compiled during the Workshop and summarises the major decisions and proposals made by the delegates at the Workshop. A Final Report summarising the discussions and decisions from the GTI Africa Regional Workshop is being prepared and will be distributed to all interested parties. A taxonomic needs assessment for Africa has been conducted as part of this project. The results from this first ever comprehensive taxonomic needs assessment covering plants, animals and micro-organisms for the African continent as a unit, are reported on here and forms an important part of the Final Report. The needs assessment highlights the prominent taxonomic impediment currently existing in the continent. Taxonomic capacity building is urgently needed in Africa; therefore, African taxonomic institutions can benefit immensely from the Global Taxonomy Initiative.
10.2307/1554975|The year 2001 marked the centennial arrival of the most famous 20th century botanist and explorer in Peru, August Weberbauer. To honor this occasion, a brief account is presented of his botanical contributions to the area in northern Peru that has been established as a national park. In this area, Weberbauer collected nearly 57 collection numbers, of which approximately 50% are type material, and at least four of which represent taxa still only known from the type.
10.2307/1554926|Strobilanthinae comprise approximately 350 species from south and southeast Asia and Melanesia. Three main classifications of Strobilanthinae have been advocated, differing markedly in the number of groups recognised, their circumscription, and the rank assigned to them. But there remains no consensus concerning the best approach to the classification of the group. To investigate this issue, a morphological cladistic analysis of the southern Indian and Sri Lankan Strobilanthinae, comprising 66 species, is described. The results of the analysis demonstrate significant limitations of all three historical approaches to the classification of the group and, furthermore, suggest that any attempt to provide an informative formal classification of Strobilanthinae will be problematic. The only satisfactory approach consistent with these results is to place all previously recognised taxa in synonymy of an expanded Strobilanthes and to recognise informally those infrageneric monophyletic groups that can be clearly diagnosed.
10.2307/1554927|Malesherbia (Malesherbiaceae) is a small, xerophytic group endemic to the Peruvian and Chilean deserts and adjacent Argentina. Malesherbia humilis var. humilis, M. humilis var. propinqua, M. humilis var. parviflora, M. gabrielae, M. taltalina, and M. multiflora form a morphologically cohesive group native to Chile and Argentina characterized by a profusion of small flowers and a short, bushy habit. The difficulty in distinguishing among these taxa suggests that the taxonomic delimitations may not be meaningful. A phenetic study was conducted to determine if this complex is best treated as a large, polymorphic species or as a series of very similar yet distinguishable taxa. Sixteen morphological characters were examined on 113 operational taxonomic units (OTUs); the data were analyzed using UPGMA, PCA, and discriminant analyses. Five clusters were identified by the analyses. These clusters are distinguishable by minor characters and are geographically cohesive. Because of the minor nature of the differences found and the unreliability of most differences noted in the descriptions of the taxa, these five clusters are recognized as varieties of M. humilis. A key to the varieties and short descriptions of each are presented.
10.2307/1554928|Mesembryanthemaceae Fenzl, here defined as excluding Aizoaceae Rudolphi s.str., are divided into five major groups, primarily on the basis of characters of the floral nectary. In terms of nectary type, the meronectary is considered a synapomorphy for the family Mesembryanthemaceae. The koilomorphic meronectary is a synapomorphy for subfamily Mesembryanthemoideae, considered the basal group; it is not further divided at tribal level. Four distinct nectary types characterize the more specialized subfamily Ruschioideae Schwantes in Ihlenf., Schwantes & Straka emend. Bittrich & H. E. K. Hartmann, and are used here to establish a new tribal classification for the group. Tribe Apatesieae Schwantes emend. Chesselet, G. F. Sm. & A. E. van Wyk (seven genera) is characterized by a broad, flat holonectary. Fruits in this tribe have diversified and several have lost hygrochastic properties. The group is regarded as primitive among Ruschioideae. Subtribe Dorotheanthinae Schwantes ex Ihlenf. & Struck (three genera) is raised to tribal level as Dorotheantheae (Schwantes ex Ihlenf. & Struck) Chesselet, G. F. Sm. & A. E. van Wyk. Plants in this tribe have semi-succulent leaves and all are annuals. The group has flowers with broad, flat meronectaries, and is not defined by any synapomorphy in terms of nectary type. Tribe Delospermeae Chesselet, G. F. Sm. & A. E. van Wyk (27 genera) is newly proposed to include all taxa with a lophomorphic meronectary; it has diversified mostly in the summer-rainfall region of southern Africa. Tribe Ruschieae, as emended here, incorporates 71 genera. It is characterized by a lophomorphic holonectary and has diversified mostly in the arid winter-rainfall region of southern Africa. Nectary types suggest primitiveness of Delospermeae in relation to Ruschieae among the highly succulent ruschioid taxa and support previous hypotheses suggesting that more derived Ruschioideae originated in the summer-rainfall region of southern Africa.
10.2307/1554929|A revision of the eight native Moroccan species of Lavandula L. section Pterostoechas Ging., based on herbarium studies, SEM photographs, and field observations, is presented utilising morphological, phenological and ecological characters. Within Lavandula of Morocco, L. sect. Pterostoechas with six species is the most diverse, one of which is described here as new (L. rejdalii Upson & Jury). Four of these species are endemic: L. maroccana Murb., L. tenuisecta Coss. ex Ball, L. rejdalii Upson & Jury, and L. mairei Humbert [with two varieties, L. mairei var. mairei and L. mairei var. antiatlantica (Humbert) Maire]. The other two species, Lavandula multifida L. and L. coronopifolia Poir., are native but more widespread species. The distribution of the species in Morocco is shown in grid maps. Lavandula brevidens (Humbert) Maire and its infraspecific taxa are not retained, being reduced to synonymy under L. tenuisecta and L. rejdalii. Full synonymy is given for all taxa and names are lectotypified as necessary.
10.2307/1554930|Phylogenetic relationships of the African and Australian Thymelaeaceae were investigated by parsimony analysis of 41 rbcL nucleotide sequences, including 27 genera and several outgroup taxa. In a second analysis, plastid trnL intron and trnL-F intergenic spacer sequences for the same taxa were included as well. The results from the separate analyses produced highly congruent, although not identical, results. Lastly we combined both sequence regions in one analysis to improve resolution and support. Thymelaeaceae are monophyletic with Thymelaeoideae, Aquilarioideae, Gonystyloideae and Gilgiodaphnoideae clearly recognised. Gonystylus and Lethedon are grouped together, contrary to previous studies that placed Lethedon in Aquilarioideae. The molecular evidence does not support monophyly of the largely African genus Gnidia; at least four major lineages could be identified. Pimelea (Australian) is embedded within one of these lineages, and the others are more closely related to Drapetes (New Zealand and South America), Struthiola, Passerina and Lachnaea (all African).
10.2307/1554931|An ecogeographic survey was completed for two pairs of South American Solanum species: (1) S. juglandifolium and S. ochranthum, and (2) S. lycopersicoides and S. sitiens. The purpose of this survey was to characterize the distribution, ecology, and phenology of these species and to screen for factors that might constitute premating reproductive isolating mechanisms between each pair. Passport data from 276 herbarium specimens were entered into a database, which was subsequently analyzed to determine the ecogeographic distribution and phenology of the surveyed species. The differences between species uncovered by the survey were then considered in the context of reproductive isolation. As S. juglandifolium and S. ochranthum were found to have overlapping ecogeographic preferences and phenology, it was postulated that postmating isolating mechanisms form the principal barrier to hybridization between the two species. Unlike S. juglandifolium and S. ochranthum, S. lycopersicoides and S. sitiens differed markedly in ecogeographic distribution. The species have been successfully crossed several times artificially, so the differences in distribution found in this survey probably contribute to maintaining species barriers between the two. In summary, this ecogeographic survey provided a useful method for analyzing the potential for interspecific gene flow between closely related taxa.
10.2307/1554932|A Java-based program is presented that provides a visualisation tool for display of and comparison between classification hierarchies. Taxa, or groups of taxa, can be tracked across multiple, overlapping classifications. Recognition of congruence and dissimilarity between classifications can be visually assessed through pattern matching. Software development, testing, and operation of the tool are discussed, together with potential applications. Further information (including software) is available via the Prometheus website [www.prometheus db.org].
10.2307/1554934| A search for Fries's "Scleromyceti Sueciae" at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (PH) was initiated following the receipt of a specimen annotated "Suec. Fr." from the Schweinitz Herbarium. Study of the collection of fungi at PH revealed 340 similarly annotated specimens, 76 printed labels from Fascicles 1-6, and 8 of the first edition of the "Scleromyceti Sueciae," and a page of the index from Decade XXXI of Fascicle 9. In many cases, sheets from this exsiccata were folded inward to form packets that enclosed both the specimen and the printed label. This paper also reports the discovery of 21 specimens from the "Deutschlands Schwmme" at PH. 
10.2307/1554935|This article provides a short life history of the Danish count and amateur botanist Frederik Christian Raben, giving a short account of his journey in Brazil, a history of his Brazilian herbaria, and explanations of the annotations on his specimens. A few years after his death, F. C. Raben's Brazilian herbarium was divided into different sets. Specimens with scanty or sometimes even misleading collection data were already accessible to students of Brazilian flora in 1842. Specimens with Raben's original rather informative labels that remained with his family were temporarily accessible in 1887-1905 and were acquired by the herbarium in Copenhagen in 1996.
10.2307/1554936|A neotype, LINN 262.17, is designated for Rhamnus pumilus Turra and a lectotype, Herb. Burser XXII: 14 (UPS), for R. alpinus L. The typification of these names is necessary in establishing their correct application for a revision of Rhamnus sectio Rhamnastrum Rouy.
10.2307/1554857|Green algae are present in desert soils as components of microbiotic communities that also include cyanobacteria and other prokaryotes, lichens, non-lichenized fungi, invertebrates, and other photosynthetic eukaryotes such as diatoms, eustigmatophytes, and xanthophytes. The green algae that occur in crusts are morphologically simple unicells, packets of cells, or weak filaments, yet represent a diverse assemblage of taxa spanning the classes Chlorophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae, and Charophyceae. As part of an ongoing study of the biodiversity of microbiotic crust communities in the western United States and Northern Mexico, a large number of green algae were isolated and characterized morphologically and genetically. Phylogenetic analyses using ribosomal RNA gene sequence data have greatly aided our understanding of the diversity and evolution of desert green algae. Our results indicate that desert green algae evolved from aquatic green algae at least five independent times. In addition, the desert green algae are derived from freshwater, not marine, green ancestors. Some lineages of green algae have a high proportion of desert taxa, while other lineages thus far have no known desert representatives. Many of the isolates are likely to be new taxa. These taxa represent independent lineages of green plants that have evolved to inhabit desert environments. Because they are distinct from but phylogenetically related to embryophyte taxa, these other "land plants" can offer important biochemical and physiological comparisons to desert-dwelling embryophytes.
10.2307/1554858| An index of Chihuahuan floristic affinity was constructed to characterize the floristic variation over a 5 latitudinal gradient in the northern Chihuahuan Desert, with an emphasis on evaluating northern boundary conditions. The index was based on evaluating the ranges of 494 species from 590 vegetation plots from Bouteloua eriopoda and B. gracilis grasslands and Larrea tridentata scrub, distributed among four sites along the gradient. The most northern site, the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge (34N latitude), while maintaining a complement of primarily southern distributed species, had the lowest index values and the fewest Chihuahuan endemics (3%) and Southwestern desert species (19%) in general. At the intermediate sites (Jornada/Tularosa basins and Otero Mesa), one and two degrees further south, index values increased conspicuously along with number of Chihuahuan endemics (7%) and the Southwestern desert species (37%). At 29N latitude, the Sierra del Carmen Protected Area in northern Mexico was the furthest southern site. It represented typical hot and dry Chihuahuan Desert conditions where Chihuahuan endemics comprised 29% of species complement and Southwestern desert species made up 55%. With respect to floristic boundaries, the Sevilleta was clearly transitional to the southern Shortgrass Prairie and Intermountain (Great Basin-Colorado Plateau) provinces. While it supported several grassland and shrubland associations that maintained their overall Chihuahuan character, there were also several associations with primarily northern affinities, and also a set unique to the Sevilleta, reflecting its ecotonal nature. The results show that sound biosystematics, biogeographical analyses and indices like those presented here can provide an important context for questions in synecology, plant ecology, and conservation biology. 
10.2307/1554859|Four families of the eleven or so families of Caryophyllales have been particularly successful at adapting to xeric environments: (1) ice plants (Aizoaceae), (2) cacti (Cactaceae), (3) "Old World cacti" (Didiereaceae); and (4) portulacs (Portulacaceae). Ice plants adapted to the harsh conditions of the deserts of southern Africa; many evolved leaf succulence to an extreme degree, some went underground, others lost the ability to make normal wood, and all had to adapt their reproductive strategies in pollination or seed dispersal. Cacti adapted to deserts of South, Central, and North America by losing their leaves over time and evolving various types of succulent stems. Cacti also adapted by greatly reducing the presence of vessels in their wood, evolving a novel tracheid type termed wide-band tracheids, and evolving CAM and C
10.2307/1554860| Quantitative comparisons of leaf morphology for evaluating taxonomic relationships may be conducted by traditional morphometrics, outline analyses, or geometric morphometrics. These approaches were employed for examining relationships among trees of two species of maple, Acer rubrum and A. saccharinum, and their hybrid (A. freemanii). Leaf samples from six hybrid trees (three each from two accessions) and 40 trees field identified as either species were pressed and dried. Leaf outline and landmark data were captured for each leaf, and linear and angular measures were derived from the landmark configurations. A vector of character means, a mean leaf outline, and a consensus landmark configuration were generated for each tree. Traditional morphological measurements, a single-parameter outline descriptor, elliptic Fourier coefficients of the outlines, and relative warp scores for the landmarks were used to depict relationships among the 46 OTUs. All three data types reveal similar patterns with respect to the two species, and the hybrids are generally intermediate between the two species. The results provide evidence of genetic segregation in one hybrid accession, that several of the field sampled trees are naturally occurring hybrids, and that relative warps analysis can reveal aspects of shape variation not detected by the other analyses. 
10.2307/1554861| The identity of the frequently cultivated Gunnera manicata Linden ex Andr has long been obscure. This species is sometimes claimed to originate from Brazil, and sometimes from Colombia. A recent molecular phylogenetic analysis of the genus indicated a Brazilian origin for G. manicata. The present study provides an historical background for G. manicata and further investigates its identity by including the ITS sequences of the two Colombian species, G. brephogea and the species identified as G. manicata, in a phylogenetic analysis. The new results corroborate the Brazilian origin for the cultivated G. manicata and firmly reject a Colombian provenance. The Colombian "G. manicata" needs a new description. For Gunnera manicata Linden ex Andr, a lectotype is designated. 
10.2307/1554862|A karyomorphological study of the species Heptacodium miconioides and five species in Caprifoliaceae of presumably related genera [Abelia and Depelta (Linnaeeae); Lycesteria and Lonicera (Caprifolieae); Weigela (Diervilleae)] reveals similarities in some karyological features such as structure of interphase nuclei, chromosome size, and condensation behaviour of chromosomes during mitotic prophase. However, differences between them in chromosome base number and morphology of metaphase chromosomes have also been revealed. The chromosome number of Heptacodium 2n = 28 is unique in Caprifoliaceae, presumably having resulted from polyploidization following hybridization between two ancestral species (possibly with chromosome base number x = 8 or 9) bearing characters of tribes Caprifolieae and Linnaeeae, respectively. The phylogenetic position of Heptacodium is discussed based on combination of karyomorphology and previous morphological and molecular data.
10.2307/1554865|A herbarium collected by H. E. van Rijgersma in the Caribbean island St. Martin 1865-1868 and 1875 has been found at the Swedish Museum of Natural History (S), Stockholm. The other known collection of van Rijgersma's plants was housed in Berlin (B), but was destroyed in World War II. Specimens collected by him are also kept in Leiden (L). Many of the Stockholm sheets have original illustrations by van Rijgersma in either black and white or in full watercolour, or both. A checklist of specimens and illustrations is presented at http://www.nrm.se/fbo/hist/rijgersma/rijgersma.html.en
10.2307/1554869|Lectotypes, neotypes and epitypes are designated by 23 specialists for 86 previously untypified Linnaean plant names belonging to the family Brassicaceae (Cruciferae), and one epitype is designated for a previously lectotypified name. These newly proposed types support the current usage of the names concerned. Earlier but ineffective or supersedable type statements are discussed.
10.2307/1554870|Lectotypes, neotypes and epitypes are designated by 32 specialists for 52 previously untypified Linnaean plant names belonging to the family Rosaceae. These newly proposed types support current usage of the names concerned. Earlier but ineffective or supersedable type statements are discussed.
10.2307/1554871|The names Campanula barbata and C. cenisia were published by Carl Linnaeus in 1759 and 1763, respectively. For both names, Linnaeus referred to material he had received from the Italian botanist Carlo Allioni, and we designate lectotypes from Allioni material preserved in LINN. For C. cenisia, it has been possible to identify the locus classicus.
10.2307/1554873|Six slides labelled "Nitophyllum martensioides", located in the slide collection of Schmitz's red algal types in the Natural History Museum, London (BM), can be identified as Opephyllum martensii Schmitz (Schmitz & Hauptfleisch, 1897). Label data fully correspond to the protologue of O. martensii (collected by Martens from Mindanao, Philippines). This collection of six slides from a single gathering is, therefore, interpreted to be the holotype for the name Opephyllum martensii, superseding the neotype recently proposed by Lin & al. (2001).
10.2307/1555019| Systematics and reproductive biology have been closely intertwined through botanical history because both rely on reproductive characters. We consider interconnections between systematics and reproductive biology from notable papers and reviews. In addition, a review of over 6,000 journals and millions of articles using the ISI Web of Science demonstrates a steady growth in publication of papers on reproductive biology from 1975 to 2001. Furthermore, the rate of publications that link systematics with reproductive biology shows a steep increase from 1991 to the present. This increase is evident even when the overall increased rate of publica-tion is considered. We identify several current research themes, including the increasing use of phylogenetic data for interpreting the evolution of reproductive systems. Though studies of reproductive biology and of systematics have the potential for "reciprocal illumination", few have used reproductive biological data for understanding the functinoal significance of morphology. Other fundamental areas where the combination of reproductive biology and systematics has proven valuable include studies of the nature of species, adaptation, speciation and hybridization. These elements of reproductive biology, especially in the context of systematic studies, will benefit from more comprehensive analyses within genera, and of taxa within communities through time and space. 
10.2307/1555020|The phylogenetic relationships of the lichenised families Caliciaceae and Physciaceae (Lecanorales, Ascomycota) are investigated with parsimony analyses of combined mtSSU and nITS rDNA sequences. Physciaceae include two well-supported groups, which correspond to the informally recognised "Buellia-group" and "Physcia-group". The prototunicate, mazaedia-forming representatives of Caliciaceae are derived from within Physciaceae, and fall within the "Buellia-group". Nomenclatural consequences of two different scenarios of changes in the present classification are discussed.
10.2307/1555021|Relationships among 38 taxa of Randia (Rubiaceae, Gardenieae) are estimated using nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (ITS), the 5S non-transcribed spacer (5S-NTS), and six morphological characters. In addition to Randia, 13 species from eight related genera in Gardenieae (four African, four neotropical) formed the ingroup. Three species from three more distantly related genera in Gardenieae (one African, two neotropical) were chosen as the outgroup. Representatives of the African ingroup genera Calochone, Macrosphyra, Oligocodon and Preussiodora formed a well supported monophyletic group as did the neotropical genera Rosenbergiodendron, Sphinctanthus and Tocoyena. Only when including morphological characters did Randia form a monophyletic group corresponding approximately to contemporary circumscription of the genus, but in this analysis Casasia appears sister to a group of Mexican, Central American, and Antillean Randia. There is no strong jackknife support, however, for either Randia or Casasia to be monophyletic. It is concluded that Randia is comprised of several distinct groups, each with its own geographical distribution. One group of Mexican, Central American, and Antillean Randia, including the type species, can be recognized as Randia in a strict sense. Two other South American groups can be recognized as separate taxa. One of these groups comprises mainly lowland species, and the second is comprised of strictly Andean species.
10.2307/1555022|Plagiochila section Bidentes Carl was erected for some of the tiniest species of the genus that often possess caducous or fragmenting leaves. Current discussions focus on whether P. sect. Bidentes represents a natural species group or should be broken up into two lineages, P. sect. Bidentes s.str. and P. sect. Caducilobae Inoue. Phylogenetic analyses of nrITS sequences of 28 species of Plagiochila produced several independent lineages that correspond with morphologically and phytochemically defined sections of Plagiochila (i.e., P. sects. Arrectae, Fuscoluteae, Glaucescentes, Hylacoetes, Plagiochila, Rutilantes, and Vagae). Plagiochila bidens, the type of P. sect. Bidentes, is placed in a clade with several members of P. sect. Arrectae Carl; therefore, P. sect. Bidentes is treated as a synonym of P. sect. Arrectae. The type of P. sect. Caducilobae, P. caduciloba H. L. Blomq., as well as several other members of the "Bidentes/Caducilobae-complex", cluster with members of P. sect. Rutilantes Carl, a group to which can therefore be assigned the majority of species currently placed in P. sect. Bidentes, i.e., excluding the type. Morphologically, members of P. sect. Rutilantes are characterized by a "free" perianth. In contrast, the members of P. sect. Arrectae usually possess perianths that are covered by bracts at least in the basal half. Plagiochila loriloba Herzog ex Carl [syn.: P. cuneata var. loriloba (Herzog ex Carl) Herzog] is recognized at the rank of species.
10.2307/1555023|The internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) of 18S-26S nuclear ribosomal DNA were sequenced for 13 species of Apioideae from the Sino-Himalayan flora [Apium ventricosum (= Sium frigidum), Arcuatopterus thalictrioideus, Cyclorhiza peucedanifolia, Meeboldia achilleifolia, Notopterygium forbesii, N. weberbauerianum, Pternopetalum delavayi, P. vulgare, Pterocyclus rivulorum, Sinocarum cruciatum, Sinodielsia delavayi, Tongoloa elata, and Trachydium simplicifolium], relationships of which are controversial or obscure and unresolved on the basis of morphological data. Phylogenetic trees inferred by neighbor-joining, parsimony analysis, and Bayesian inference are topologically congruent, but not identical. The newly obtained data permit testing of several hypotheses regarding these taxa. Some of the early hypotheses treat local species under well-known European genera (e.g., Apium, Carum, Pimpinella, etc.), but these are not supported by phylogenetic analysis of nuclear rDNA spacer sequences. In particular, Sinodielsia, Meeboldia, Tongoloa, and Pternopetalum are distant from Pimpinella; Pternopetalum, Sinocarum and Tongoloa are remote from Carum; Arcuatopterus is separate from Peucedanum and Angelica; Pternopetalum is distinct from Cryptotaenia; and Notopterygium and Pterocyclus are separate from Pleurospermum. Chinese Notopterygium is shown to be closely related to Siberian and Mongolian Hansenia; this, plus similarity in fruit structure, suggests that they are congeneric. Apium ventricosum, more commonly known as Sium frigidum, appears a close relative of Sinocarum. Affinities of most Sino-Himalayan Apioideae, therefore, are found among taxa from the same and adjacent territories. Wide disjunction between presumptively related taxa has been revealed only in Cyclorhiza and Komarovia. Sinodielsia and Meeboldia are also revealed to be clearly distinct genera.
10.2307/1555024| Two clones of Mentha arvensis L., both with 2n = 72 from Europe, one with 49.20  2.28% pulegone, another with 57.31  9.41% linalool, were hybridized with M. longifolia (L.) L. from Europe with 2n = 24 and 51.87  0.50% trans-piperitone oxide. The F
10.2307/1555025| Nonea, one of the largest but lesser known genera of Boraginaceae tribe Boragineae, has been investigated by means of phenetics and cladistics to analyse morphological diversity and phylogenetic relationships within the group. Cluster analysis of 29 taxa recognizes five groups of annual species placed in one large cluster and two groups of perennial taxa in another cluster. Principal Component Analysis shows that the enigmatic Greek species, Paraskevia cesatiana ( Nonea cesatiana), is morphologically intermediate between Nonea and Pulmonaria, but closer to the latter due to fruit characters. Successive weighting using 42 characters and Pulmonaria as outgroup indicates that Nonea is paraphyletic, because the two species of Elizaldia are nested within the group of annual taxa. The South Mediterranean species N. vesicaria is closer to the North African taxa of Elizaldia than to any other member of Nonea. The perennial species of the N. intermedia group growing in mesic habitats of the Pontic-Caucasian region and Eastern Anatolia are in basal position, whereas Paraskevia cesatiana is not nested within Nonea. Candolle's sections of Nonea are not clearly supported. Nonea sect. Orthocaryum also appears paraphyletic due to the position of N. obtusifolia, a taxon with numerous autapomorphies that are difficult to interprete phylogenetically. Possible trends of character evolution are discussed also in the light of cytogeographical aspects. These aspects indicate x = 10 as the primary base number and either polyploidy or descending dysploidy associated with the adaptive shortening of the life-cycle as major driving forces of species formation 
10.2307/1555026|Two new species in Campanulaceae, Theilera capensis D. Y. Hong and Craterocapsa alfredica D. Y. Hong, are described from South Africa. Theilera capensis is different from T. guthriei in having oblong leaves on short branches, corolla lobes nearly as long as the tube, filaments conspicuously dilated, and an annular disc. Craterocapsa alfredica is relatively close to C. insizwae, but differs from it in having ovate or ovate-lanceolate leaves, narrow-lanceolate calyx lobes, and a 3-lobed stigma.
10.2307/1555028|The Melastomataceae collected by Giuseppe Raddi (1770-1829) during his expedition to Brazil (1817-1818) and housed at FI and PI are studied. The collections typify names in the genera Bertolonia Raddi, Leandra Raddi, Melastoma L. and Rhexia L. For 22 species we provide information about types, nomenclature, taxonomy and geographical distribution.
10.2307/1555029|Lectotypifications for names proposed by Linnaeus in Viburnum (Viburnaceae) have been made for only three of the ten entities described in 1753 and 1762. Lectotypifications of the remaining seven names are proposed with comments on the three previously designated herbarium sheets.
10.2307/1555030|Lectotypes, neotypes and epitypes are designated by 11 specialists for 18 previously untypified Linnaean plant names belonging to the family Ericaceae. These newly proposed types support the current usage of the names concerned. Earlier but ineffective or supersedable type statements are discussed.
10.2307/1555032| The nomenclature of the taxa often called Matricaria recutita L. (common chamomile) and Tripleurospermum perforatum (Mrat) Lanz (scentless mayweed) is discussed with reference to nomenclatural history, recent typifications, and the provisions of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. Justification is presented for the use of the name Matricaria chamomilla L. for common chamomile and the epithet inodorum rather than perforatum for scentless mayweed, both of which have been avoided in much recent literature. Varietal nomenclature of M. chamomilla is addressed, and the combination Tripleurospermum maritimum subsp. inodorum is validated. 
10.2307/1555033|A previously designated lectotype for the name Veronica agrestis L. is here superseded in favour of an alternative original element on the grounds of conflict with the protologue in accordance with Art. 9.17(b) of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. An earlier proposal to conserve the name with a conserved type is withdrawn.
10.2307/1555034|The top figure of tab. 46 in Micheli's Nova Genera Plantarum is selected as lectotype, and a specimen from his herbarium (FI-M) as epitype of the name of the lichen, Lobaria amplissima (Scop.) Forssell.
10.2307/1555035|Uvaria hirsuta Jack is one of the more common species of the genus Uvaria (Annonaceae) in the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. The original type was destroyed in 1824, and any duplicates which may have existed are now lost. Wallich Herbarium Catalogue no. 6458b is proposed here as neotype for U. hirsuta. The specimen is of high quality, includes both flowers and fruits, and was collected at the type locality soon after Jack's original collections.
10.2307/1555036|Helotium yunnanense is re-described based upon examination of the holotype and an epitype designated, due to the lack of apothecia matching the original description in the holotype material. Detailed morphological study indicated that the fungus is a member of the genus Lambertella. A new combination, Lambertella yunnanensis, is, therefore, proposed.
10.2307/1555037| Gonalo Sampaio authored 103 new names of lichens, comprising one new genus, 60 new species, 14 new infraspecific taxa, 25 new combinations and two nomina nova. In addition, he proposed 42 "names" that were not validly published, 18 of these being simple nomina nuda and 21 apparently representing invalid attempts to publish new combinations. The type material is deposited in the Herbarium of University of Porto (PO), except in three cases. Apart from a few specimens from Spain, the material derives from Portugal. For the names of all new taxa the type collections are listed, either a holotype or a lectotype (usually here designated). In addition, a few lichen names authored by Maurice Bouly de Lesdain or William Nylander and based on Portuguese material preserved at PO are listed with indications of type. 
10.2307/1555038|The nomenclature and taxonomy of two Roccella species are examined and clarified. Roccella tinctoria DC., a nomen novum for Lichen roccella L., replaces Roccella vincentina ["vicentina"] (Vain.) Follm., the name which has been most commonly used in recent years for this sorediate species. Roccella fucoides (Dicks.) Vain, based on Lichen fucoides Dicks., is neotypified and is the correct name for what has been known as R. phycopsis, now shown to be an illegitimate superfluous name for R. fucoides.
10.2307/3647298|The ceramiaceous red algal genus Campylaephora J. Agardh includes three species that occur exclusively in the northwest Pacific Ocean. We studied the morphology, basiphyte range, and molecular phylogeny of Campylaephora borealis, considered a variety of the C crassa complex, using material collected over its geographic range. Samples of C. borealis, C. crassa, C. hypnaeoides, and putative relatives were taken from 43 locations in Korea, Japan, and Far-East Russia, including the type localities of the first two of these species. Campylaephora borealis is distinguished by proliferous branchlets on all sides of the main branches and an alternate branching pattern. It is characteristically epiphytic on diverse plants, such as Prionitis divaricata, and occurs mostly in exposed sites. It is distributed from Maengbang, Korea to Nakhodka, Far-East Russia. Based on pairwise divergences of the plastid RuBisCo spacer region and psbA sequences, C. borealis is more closely related to C. hypnaeoides than to C. crassa. The topology of the tree constructed using the combined data shows the monophyly of C. borealis, which is clearly separated from other Campylaephora species and putative relatives. Our molecular data together with the basiphyte range and a morphological reappraisal point to the independent taxonomic position of C. borealis, isolated from Campylaephora crassa. Therefore, we propose to raise Campylaephora crassa f. borealis to the rank of species: Campylaephora borealis (Nakamura) Seo et al., stat. nov. The phylogeny of Campylaephora is also discussed.
10.2307/3647299|The internal transcribed spacers of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrITS) from 43 species of Nepeta and representatives of closely related genera (Lallemantia, Dracocephalum and Agastache) and outgroups (Lavandula, Stachys, Newcastelia and Prostanthera) were sequenced. Parsimony analysis indicated that Nepeta is monophyletic and composed of five major monophyletic groups, most of which comprise species belonging to more than one section in previous classifications. These five clades are composed of: (1) sect. Spartonepeta; (2) sects. Macronepeta + Spicatae; (3) sects. Nepeta + Micranthae p.p. + Oxynepeta + Schizocalyx + Macrostegiae; (4) sects. Capituliferae + Denudatae + Micranthae p.p. + Micronepeta p.p.; and (5) sect. Psilonepeta. The phylogenetic relationships among species of these groups are congruent with the distribution of some floral characters, including corolla shape, bract texture, color and pollen exine ornamentation.
10.2307/3647300|To provide an overview of New World Asclepiadoideae, we here evaluate Asclepiadeae classification by comparing the taxonomic arrangement of subtribes with a topology obtained through analyses of two plastid DNA regions (trnL intron and trnL-F intergenic spacer) for 111 species of Asclepiadoideae representing the major lineages of the subfamily. Without Jobinia, Nephradenia and Barjonia, Asclepiadeae are not monophyletic. The monotypic African genus Eustegia, with pendent pollinia, may represent the sister clade of Marsdenieae - Ceropegieae, the group composed of plants with erect pollinia. Metastelmatinae including African plants are also non-monophyletic, and the circumscription of the recently re-instated Cynanchinae should be studied further. Overall, Asclepiadeae are composed of three main clades. The Old World Astephaninae are the sister group of the other Asclepiadeae, which are divided into the ACTG (Asclepiadinae, Cynanchinae, Tylophorinae and Glossonematinae) and MOG (Metastelmatinae, Oxypetalinae and Gonolobinae) clades. According to this study, the New World Asclepiadoideae fall into just four clades: (1) Marsdenia (Marsdenieae), (2) Asclepias (Asclepiadinae, Asclepiadeae), (3) Cynanchum subgenus Mellichampia (Cynanchinae, Asclepiadeae), and (4) MOG, the clade comprising the majority of New World Asclepiadoideae.
10.2307/3647301|Nuclear ITS sequence data were employed to assess phylogenetic relationships within Ribes, an angiosperm genus of approximately 200 species that is well-known for its taxonomic complexity. Our analyses revealed several major clades within Ribes, informally referred to here as the Berisia, Calobotrya, Coreosma, and Grossularia sensu lato clades. The clades recovered indicate that some of the subgenera recognized in previous taxonomic treatments are largely monophyletic, including Calobotrya, Grossularia, and Grossularioides. Our data suggest broader circumscriptions of Lobbia, Berisia, and Coreosma. Other subgenera, such as Heritiera and Ribesia are likely polyphyletic, with constituent taxa scattered throughout the topology. The gooseberries in the broad sense (subgenera Grossularia, Hesperia, Lobbia and Robsonia), sometimes treated as a distinct genus Grossularia, are clearly embedded within Ribes and do not merit status as a separate genus. Comparison with a cpDNA topology reveals some similarities, such as the monophyly of subgenera Calobotrya and Grossularia and the inclusion of all gooseberries (Grossularia s.l.) within Ribes. There are also noteworthy differences. In contrast to both ITS sequence data and morphological data, cpDNA restriction site data do not reveal a monophyletic Grossularia sensu lato clade comprising subgenera Grossularia, Hesperia, Lobbia, and Robsonia. However, few of the differences between the cpDNA and ITS trees are strongly supported. Our ITS topology suggests that dioecy may have evolved several times in the genus. We similarly explored floral form in light of our topology; highly reflexed sepals represent a morphological synapomorphy that unites the subgenera Grossularia, Hesperia, Lobbia and Robsonia, with a reversal in a single taxon.
10.2307/3647302|Taxonomic features of Limonium subg. Myriolepis are reviewed and compared with those of other taxa in Plumbaginaceae. The new genus Myriolepis is proposed on the basis of morphological, karyological and phytochemical characters to include two western Mediterranean species of Limonium sect. Myriolepis: L. ferulaceum and L. diffusum. Remaining taxa belonging to L. subg. Myriolepis (those in L. sects. Siphonantha and Polyarthrion) are recognised as sections in L. subg. Limonium. Affinities to other taxa of Limonium, sometimes suggested as related to Myriolepis, are also discussed.
10.2307/3647303|We have studied a taxon from South Africa that has been hidden for more than 150 years within Scilla plumbea (Hyacinthaceae). However, phylogenetic reconstruction based on trnL-F data, morphological evidence (including seed characters), and karyology suggest independent status. DNA data place it close to the Daubenya alliance but not close to any particular genus of Massonieae previously included within Scilla s.l. Unique characters of seeds indicate that this taxon does not belong to the Daubenya clade. Analysis of the iconotype of Scilla plumbea Lindl., on the other hand, reveals morphological details suggesting membership in the Scilla natalensis clade (= genus Merwilla in the recent classification of Speta). Merwilla, however, occupies a basal position among Massonieae and is not related to the Daubenya clade. Based on all data, we describe this taxon as a new genus and species Spetaea lachenaliiflora Wetschnig & Pfosser.
10.2307/3647304|The Iranian species of Nepeta were investigated as part of a phylogenetic study of the genus. The relationships among species revealed the status of some taxa including three new species. The new species are recognized by differences in morphology as well as molecular characters. Nepeta balouchestanica, N. mahanensis, and N. hormozganica are described as new and their relationships with closely related taxa discussed.
10.2307/3647306|Recent estimates of the number of described species of seed plant have varied by as much as 62%. The underlying methodology of these estimates is characterised and discussed. We present a revised figure for the number of seed plants based on estimating rates of synonymy in a sample of recently monographed taxa. We conclude that some recent figures overestimate the number of described seed plant species by more than 200,000. This discrepancy is explained by an over-reliance on checklists and floristic studies that underestimate synonymy rates.
10.2307/3647309|Notable in the plant collection of the Sess and Mocio Herbarium of the Royal Botanical Expedition to New Spain, housed in the Royal Botanical Garden in Madrid, are plants from the Lesser Antilles that Hans West gave to Martn de Sess as a result of their friendship following a meeting in 1797 in Puerto Rico. Some are type specimens and perhaps only available in this herbarium.
10.2307/3647310|Contrary to the listings of Index Muscorum, the type of Pleuridium sullivanii (basionym Astomum sullivanii) is not the same as, or even conspecific with, that of Tetrapterum sullivanii (basionym Phascum sullivanii). The two basionyms are based on different type specimens. Lectotypes are designated for Phascum sullivanii and Astomum sullivanii; that of the latter is identifiable as Pleuridium nervosum.
10.2307/3647311|The nomenclatural history of Hypnum lycopodioides Brid., a widespread European peatland moss that is currently known as Drepanocladus lycopodioides (Brid.) Warnst. or Pseudocalliergon lycopodioides (Brid.) Hedens, is presented. The placement of two neglected and poorly known names, "Hypnum rugosum Sm." and H. diastrophyllum Lam. & DC., in the protologue of H. lycopodioides created some nomenclatural pitfalls. It is shown that H. rugosum sensu Dickson (1801), Withering (1801), Smith (1804) and Smith & Sowerby (1811) are all isonyms of H. rugosum Hedw. [= Rhytidium rugosum (Hedw.) Kindb.] and they have no nomenclatural status. Hypnum dias trophyllum, a species described in 1805, is considered not to be definitely included in the concept of H. lycopodioides, but the latter name is strongly endangered by H. diastrophyllum, if both species are conspecific. Of several specimens cited in the protologue of H. diastrophyllum only one specimen originating from Sweden is available for typification, and it is here selected as lectotype. It makes H. diastrophyllum conspecific with Palustriella commutata (Hedw.) Ochyra, and this taxonomic conclusion saves the current usage of H. lycopodioides. The oldest synonyms and type specimens of H. lycopodioides are listed.
10.2307/3647312|It is established that Cunila leucantha Kunth ex Schltdl. & Cham. and C. leucantha Benth. are independent names apparently applying to different species. Lectotypification of C leucantha Kunth ex Schltdl. & Cham. is effected; application of the name Cunila leucantha Benth. to any known species is uncertain. Cunila leucantha Kunth ex Schltdl. & Cham. has been confused with and treated as C. polyantha Benth., although the two are distinct species and easily distinguished by inflorescence characters. The identity of the collector of the type specimen of C. polyantha is clarified.
10.2307/3647389|Two independent lines of molecular evidence have been studied to explore phylogenetic relationships in the family Asphodelaceae. Genomic fingerprinting by ISSR (Inter Simple Sequence Repeats) analysis was compared to sequence data of the chloroplast genes matK and rbcL. Molecular data indicate that some long-established taxonomic concepts would have to be re-evaluated. The subfamily Asphodeloideae clusters as a sister group to a distinctly monophyletic Alooideae. However, several Alooideae genera, including Aloe and Haworthia, are apparently not monophyletic. From a molecular point of view, Haworthia can be divided into two distinct groups that agree closely with the current subgeneric classification: a monophyletic group including species of subgenus Haworthia, and a second polyphyletic group with the subgenera Hexangulares and Robustipedunculares. This second clade includes Poellnitzia, Astroloba, Gasteria and even one Haworthia-like aloe (Aloe aristata). In the polyphyletic assemblage currently classified as Aloe, several smaller clades can be recognised, often reflecting morphological, chemical and geographical discontinuities. The tree aloes (sections Aloidendron and Dracoaloe) and climbing aloes (series Macrifoliae) appear to have separated early in Alooideae, while other groups (e.g., the flavonoid-containing group and a Madagascan group) are embedded within and amongst other genera. Chortolirion clusters with the grass-like aloes (section Graminialoe Reynolds, syn. Leptaloe Berger), A. boylei and A. verecunda, on a well-defined branch. The current taxonomic system clearly does not reflect the phylogenetic affinities and relationships amongst the succulent genera Aloe, Astroloba, Chortolirion, Gasteria, Haworthia, and Poellnitzia.
10.2307/3647390|Phylogenetic relationships and composition of Ericameria were investigated by parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses of ITS and 3' ETS sequences for 50 taxa including all known species in Ericameria and several related taxa. The independent analyses of the data sets led to highly congruent, though not identical, results. Analyses of the combined sequence data generally improved resolution and clade support. Ericameria, Pentachaeta, Rigiopappus and Tracyina are resolved in a monophyletic group distinct from Chrysothamnus, Xylothamia, and representatives of the Solidago lineage. The expanded circumscription of Ericameria to include sections Asiris, Macronema and Stenotopsis, and species transferred from Chrysothamnus including E. albida, is supported. Within Ericameria the alignment of species into sections is not in total agreement with previously proposed relationships. Also, the molecular data do not support the treatment of section Stenotopsis as distinct from section Ericameria.
10.2307/3647391|DNA fingerprinting techniques including inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) and restriction digest patterns from 18S-26S nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacers (ITS) were combined with a detailed morphological analysis to seek characters that discriminate closely related species in the pleurocarpous moss genus, Rhytidiadelphus. The two sibling species, R. subpinnatus and R. squarrosus, were indistinguishable based on ITS markers but displayed a clear genetic discontinuity based on ISSR markers. Overall, genetic divergence was similar among R. squarrosus and R. subpinnatus on the one hand and R. loreus and R. triquetrus on the other. The results clearly support the specific status of R. subpinnatus and R. japonicus within the controversial R. squarrosus complex. New divergent morphological characters were found between R. subpinnatus and R. squarrosus. The results suggest that ISSR markers may be an alternative for distinguishing sibling moss species when sequences of the most variable genomic regions traditionally used at low taxonomic level, such as ITS, do not provide the appropriate degree of polymorphism.
10.2307/3647392|AFLP variation has been assessed within and among populations of Hypochaeris acaulis (Asteraceae), a species isolated in moist seeps and rivulets throughout its range in the southern Andes. Plants in seven populations were sampled with six pairs of primer combinations. Genetic affinities were calculated by Nei-Li distance, and relationships were determined by neighbor-joining. All individuals, except two, clustered with other members of their same population. These results suggest restricted gene flow among populations, perhaps resulting from limited dispersal capability. It was estimated that a migrant is exchanged between two randomy chosen populations approximately once in eight generations, a low level of genetic exchange. A correlation of geographic and genetic distances is seen among populations, corresponding to isolation by distance. Genetic variation largely resides among populations (67.9%) rather than within (32.1%). No deep genetic divisions larger than those seen among the populations were revealed, suggesting no major biogeographic impacts, except for possible isolation of individual populations due to recent local Pleistocene glaciation. A positive correlation of genetic variation exists with population size, and a strong correlation exists with observed flowering and fruiting behavior. Pollen/ovule ratios were used to suggest that the species is facultatively autogamous, a breeding system that would be consistent with the observed pattern of genetic variation.
10.2307/3647393|North America is one of three main centers of species endemism for Atriplex, one of the largest genera in Chenopodiaceae. The monoecious herbaceous plants with Kranz anatomy, bibracteolate pistillate flowers lacking a perianth, cuneate to obovate fruiting bracteoles (usually broadest above the middle and connate at least to the middle), and erect seeds with superior radicles have been classified in Atriplex section Obione, which contains 32 species in North America. A numerical taxonomic analysis of the 32 species of the section, based on 30 morphological characters, was carried out to evaluate existing infra-sectional classifications. The phenetic analyses (cluster and ordination) suggest recognition of seven subsections, four of which are monotypic (Graciliflorae, Leucophyllae, Powellianae, and Truncatae). The largest group contains all species previously considered as the "pentandra group", here recognized as subsection Arenariae. Another cluster includes A. cordulata, A. depressa, A. parishii, A. pusilla, A. tularensis, and A. wolfii, supporting the recognition of subsection Pusillae. Another cluster suggests recognition of subsection Argenteae, including A. argentea and A. saccaria, which where considered previosusly as monotypic subsections. Atriplex hillmanii is left as incertae sedis, its relationship with A. truncata needing further clarification.
10.2307/3647394|All members of Saniculoideae sensu stricto are unique in their fruit structure, having the endocarp non-lignified, outgrowths on mericarps, usually prominent intrajugal secretory ducts, vallecular vittae totally absent, commissural vittae absent except in Lagoecia L. (which should be better placed in Apioideae), carpophore absent except in Alepidea F. Delaroche, and crystals dispersed throughout the mesocarp. The fruits of the African genus Lichtensteinia Cham. & Schltdl. are very similar to those of Saniculoideae, having very prominent intrajugal secretory ducts and lacking both vallecular and commissural vittae (the endocarp of one mericarp is lignified, the other not). Furthermore, scattered crystals are present in the mesocarp. Three other African genera (Arctopus L., Polemanniopsis B.L. Burtt and Steganotaenia Hochst.) also have some fruit characters that are similar to those of Saniculoideae, such as the total absence of vallecular and commissural vittae, combined with intrajugal cavities (which are enormous in the latter two genera). They differ in some respects, such as nearly always having lignified endocarps, non-functional intrajugal secretory ducts forming cavities, wings (in Polemanniopsis and Steganotaenia), and an absence of crystals. A cladistic analysis based on all anatomical characters shows that Lichtensteinia, Polemanniopsis and Steganotaenia are directly basal to the Saniculoideae, and that there is sufficient morphological evidence (in support of earlier molecular systematic studies) to expand the circumscription of the subfamily to include these genera.
10.2307/3647395|Previous descriptions of Garrya (Garryaceae) floral morphology are inconsistent. Anatomical studies have long confirmed that the pistillate flowers possess an inferior ovary. Descriptions of the staminate flowers sometimes describe a vestigial superior ovary; other authors report no such structure. New observations of staminate flowers confirm the presence of an intrastaminal structure. I hypothesize that the structure previously interpreted as a vestigial ovary is, in fact, a vestigial nectary disc. Thus the staminate flowers cannot be considered hypogynous and do not contradict the interpretation of the pistillate flowers as epigynous. This observation resolves the paradox of contrasting floral form in the pistillate and staminate flowers.
10.2307/3647396|Myristicaceae are sister group to the remaining five families of Magnoliales, which make up the suborder Magnoliineae. Both with regard to morphological and DNA sequence data, Myristicaceae have diverged substantially from Magnoliineae, whereas at the same time monophyly of Magnoliales is conclusive. This relationship between Myristicaceae and Magnoliineae is affirmed by describing the suborder Myristicineae.
10.2307/3647397|Vernonia gertii Dematteis sp. nov. is described and illustrated from Serra da Bodoquena in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul. The new species is characterized by the presence of large lanceolate leaf blades, attenuate at the base, and heads with pedicellate and aristate phyllaries, all of which clearly separate it from other South American members of Vernonieae. Vernonia gertii presents a superficial resemblance to V. eriolepis Gardn., which also shows aristate phyllaries and is distributed in Mato Grosso do Sul. However, V. eriolepis has sessile heads, ferrugineous pubescence and ovate-lanceolate leaves that are shortly attenuate at the base. In addition, a new combination in the endemic genus Mattfeldanthus H. Rob. & R. M. King (M andrade-limae) is also proposed.
10.2307/3647398|Kandelia (Rhizophoraceae) has long been regarded as a monotypic mangrove genus. Recent studies in chromosome number, molecular phylogeography, physiological adaptation, and leaf anatomy, however, reveal that there are two well differentiated sets of geographical populations separated by the South China Sea. These are recognized as two distinct species, Kandelia candel (L.) Druce and Kandelia obovata Sheue, Liu & Yong sp. nov.
10.2307/3647400|The destruction of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest is considered the world's most alarming conservation problem. The rudimentary knowledge of the thousands of species that inhabit such a fragmented biome highlights the importance of taxonomy as a basic tool for conservation. Bromeliaceae are one of the most striking elements of the Atlantic Forest and contribute significantly to biodiversity support capacity of the communities in which they live. This article utilizes the example of Bromeliaceae in Brazil to discuss the potential impact of misguided taxonomic and nomenclatural changes on the survival of species, and how it may affect biodiversity assessment. Nominal extinction is described as a phenomenon caused by errors in taxonomic decisions that involve mistaken designation of synonyms at the specific and infraspecific level. All taxonomic decisions that have the potential to create a negative impact on the environment should be widely discussed and anchored on the precautionary principal adopted by 1992 UN Conference on the Environment.
10.2307/3647401|In the face of an increasingly challenging scientific and fiscal environment, and of shrinking government funding to research institutions, these institutions (including herbaria) must enter the "stakeholder society", in which the needs of the customer are foremost, if they are to survive and remain relevant in the new millennium. To ensure that herbaria in South Africa are indeed delivering those products and services that their customers need and require, a national workshop was organised under the auspices of the Southern African Botanical Diversity Network (SABONET), which provided the setting for discussion (with the customers) of these needs and wants. Perhaps predictably, it was established that South African end-users of botanical information need more regularly updated, more comprehensive information (e.g., in terms of species lists, name changes and distributional data) than that which they are currently getting. They furthermore want a larger choice in the format of the information not only as hard copy, but also as Internet-based electronic versions. Faster, more efficient services (especially plant identification services) are needed. In terms of infrastructure: to have more confidence in the completeness of the data, a larger, more representative collated herbarium collection (and therefore the expansion of current herbarium collections) is needed. The herbaria of South Africa face several manpower and financial constraints in the implementation of the actions needed to address adequately the needs and wants of their stakeholders.
10.2307/3647402|The binomials Capparis inermis Forssk. and C. cartilaginea Decne. are neo- and lectotypified, respectively. Thus typified, C. inermis Forssk. and C. cartilaginea Decne. are conspecific, and the correct name for the taxon would be the older binomial, C. inermis Forssk., unless a current proposal to conserve C. cartilaginea against C. inermis is accepted. Capparis sinaica Veill. is lectotypified by an illustration cited in the protologue and becomes a synonym of C. aegyptia Lam. Capparis inermis Turra is an illegitimate later homonym of Forsskl's name, and C. dahi Forssk. does not refer to a taxon belonging to the genus Capparis.
10.2307/3647403|A reassessment of the taxonomy of Liatris borealis Nutt. ex J. McNab suggests that it is not conspecific with L. novae-angliae, but is a synonym of L. scariosa L. var. scariosa. Three varieties are recognized within the L. scariosa complex; the varietal name L. borealis var. novae-angliae, not hitherto validly published, is validly published here.

It is held to be identical to the well-known North American species C. pedicellata Sarg., which it can now safely displace.
10.2307/3647444|Up to the 1960s, there was nearly complete consensus that disjunctions and endemism in the North Atlantic cannot be explained without in situ survival during the glaciations (the "nunatak hypothesis"). The alternative "tabula rasa hypothesis" of postglacial immigration was regarded to be of merely historical interest. Herein we review recent geological, molecular, taxonomic, and biogeographic data to re-examine this view. There is now strong geological evidence for some ice-free North Atlantic areas within the maximum limits of the Late Weichselian/Wisconsian ice sheets, but no fossils have been found to prove continuous in situ existence of life in these areas. Molecular data suggest that many plants and animals have migrated recently across the Atlantic, even if they lack mechanisms promoting long-distance dispersal. In other species, there are deep trans-oceanic phylogeographic splits suggesting survival in two or more refugia, but these refugia may have been located outside the ice sheets. For vascular plants, we provide an updated list of 77 north boreal, alpine, and arctic taxa accepted as North Atlantic endemics. The degree of endemism is very low (0.0-1.9% single-region endemism). Forty endemics occur in more than one of the isolated Atlantic regions, indicating extensive migration and complicating inferences on the location of refugia. Thirty-four endemics are probably not hardy enough for nunatak survival and are explained by postglacial immigration (or in situ evolution). Among the 43 "hardy" endemics, there is not a single outcrossing diploid that could suggest long-term evolution. Most of the hardy endemics are asexual or self-fertilizing polyploids, some of postglacial hybrid origin. Others are preglacial polyploids which immigrated postglacially or survived in situ. Some ice-free areas, such as the extensive Greenlandic ones, may have supported survival of some hardy organisms. The evidence accumulated since the 1960s suggests, however, that endemism and disjunctions in the North Atlantic can be explained without invoking in situ glacial survival.
10.2307/3647445|This paper presents a perspective of how phylogenetic and phylogeographic hypotheses, based on nuclear DNA sequence variation (ITS) or amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), can provide insights into the origin and evolution of the European high mountain flora. We focus on a diversity of unrelated herbaceous plant taxa that are broadly co-distributed across the European Alpine System, representing different taxonomic levels, and having either Mediterranean or Asian affinities (i.e., Anthyllis montana, Pritzelago alpina, Globularia vs. Soldanella, and Primula sect. Auricula). Our observations highlight that all taxa investigated began to diversify at the beginning of the Pleistocene or well within this period. Some of those taxa apparently followed different routes and modes of immigration, thereby colonizing the European high mountains only once (either from the East or the West) or repeatedly (from the Mediterranean Basin). Our observations further suggest that several high mountain taxa originated from lowland forms. While supporting earlier views, such a trend has generally been associated with pre-Quaternary rather than Pleistocene events. While several concordant patterns of (large-scale) spatial genetic differentiation are identified across taxa, such similarities may have arisen at either clearly different or roughly similar times. Finally, most speciation events likely occurred in allopatry, though more comprehensive studies are required to evaluate the relative importance of non-allopatric modes of speciation in the study area. We conclude that one major challenge to future evolutionary studies in European mountain plants is the accurate and reliable reconstruction of the tempo and mode of speciation across Quaternary time scales.
10.2307/3647446|A preliminary synthesis of diversification patterns of alpine plants in the Mediterranean region of Europe is presented based on seven plant groups displaying morphological differentiation and infraspecific taxa. Both previous and new phylogenetic results from ITS sequences and fingerprinting data suggest different colonization routes and modes of speciation in Androsace vitaliana (recent differentiation in the Iberian Peninsula), Anthyllis montana (west-to-east colonization and differentiation in Europe), Arenaria tetraquetra (colonization and differentiation from SE Iberian mountains to the Pyrenees; increasing number of chromosome complements), Saxifraga oppositifolia (colonization from the arctic to the Iberian Peninsula), Saxifraga pentadactylis (differentiation in Mediterranean and Eurosiberian mountains by geographic isolation), and Soldanella alpina (differentiation and colonization from northern Iberia to the Alps, and then to the Pyrenees and the Balkan Peninsula). Relative static diversification of Juniperus communis var. saxatilis in Europe, based on identity of chloroplast trnL-F sequences, is also described. Most morphological variation, expressed by number of subspecies recognized in previous taxonomic treatments of the seven plant groups, appears to have occurred during the Pleistocene (< 1.75 Myr). Recurrent change of Quaternary climatic conditions in the Mediterranean Basin, coupled with geographic characteristics, life cycle, dispersal mechanisms, and pre-Holocene genetic structure are not convincing factors to account for all the observed diversification. Additionally, stochastic processes are also considered for evaluating present-day distributions and processes of speciation.
10.2307/3647447|Climatic fluctuations during Quaternary glaciations had a significant influence on the distribution of taxa and on their intraspecific genetic structure. In this paper, we test hypotheses on Pleistocene refugia for mountain plants in the eastern part of the European Alps derived from palaeoenvironmental and geological results, with new data on distributional patterns of 288 vascular plant endemics and molecular phylogeographies of selected species. High numbers of endemics are found in calcareous regions at the southern and the eastern border of the Eastern Alps, which remained unglaciated during the Pleistocene. The distribution of local endemic taxa in general, and of silicicolous taxa in particular, shows a clear relationship with hypothetical glacial refugia in the southern, southeastern, easternmost, and northeastern Alps. Molecular phylogeographic data from several silicicolous alpine species (Androsace alpina, Androsace wulfeniana, Eritrichium nanum, Phyteuma globulariifolium, Ranunculus glacialis, Saponaria pumila) are not completely congruent. However, all genetically defined population groups are in congruence with hypothetical refugia. In general, results from distributions of endemic taxa and data from intraspecific phylogeography are compatible with previously hypothesized refugia suggesting that refugial situations have shaped the current patterns. The combination of patterns of endemism with molecular phylogeographic data provides an efficacious approach to reveal glacial refugia in vascular plants.
10.2307/3647448|There is a long-standing debate about the fate of the mountain flora of the European Alps during the Pleistocene ice ages. Two main scenarios of glacial survival of alpine plant taxa have been discussed, namely (1) total extinction within glaciated areas, survival in peripheral refugia, and postglacial re-immigration into vacant areas (tabula rasa hypothesis), and (2) long-term in situ survival within glaciated regions in isolated ice-free areas above the ice-shield (nunatak hypothesis). Four alpine species with differing distributions and ecological demands were investigated to elucidate their glacial history using molecular methods (AFLPs, RFLPs of cpDNA, RAPDs). Their glacial histories are very diverse. Whereas in situ survival in the most intensely glaciated Central Alps played an important role in Eritrichium nanum, the low alpine Erinus alpinus survived in situ on some mountains of the northern Swiss Prealps, and Rumex nivalis grows at intermediate alpine elevations in snow-beds in both the northern and the Central Swiss Alps. In the common arctic-alpine Saxifraga oppositifolia, the species with the widest distribution and ecological amplitude as compared to the other three species, it is not possible to reconstruct its glacial history. It is probable, therefore, that in the Alps, as in northern Europe, resident genotypes surviving glaciation in situ were integrated into the gene pool of postglacially immigrating periglacial individuals. The size of refugia differed according to species and region. On the one hand, refugia were restricted to individual mountains (E. alpinus, R. nivalis). On the other hand, they spanned several mountain ranges in larger areas (E. nanum, E. alpinus). Postglacial migration over longer distances was inferred for E. alpinus from southern France to northern Switzerland, and, over shorter distances, for R. nivalis from the northern Prealps into the Central Alps in Switzerland. Both postglacial immigration and in situ survival shaped the phylogeography at least of E. alpinus and R. nivalis. It is likely, therefore, that the nunatak and the tabula rasa hypotheses are too simplistic to describe the rich diversity of glacial and postglacial processes in Alpine plant species. It rather appears that the glacial history of each species is to a certain degree unique and influenced by its ecological demands or breeding systems. Moreover, stochasticity has to be regarded of essential importance, since factors such as preglacial distribution patterns or postglacial dispersal or extinction events should have had effects on the present genetic composition and the distribution of a species.
10.2307/3647449|With the advent of PCR and DNA sequencing, DNA data have been widely applied to the assessment of relationships among taxa of recent origin (e.g., island endemics). Numerous recent studies have used DNA sequence data and/or cpDNA RFLPs to reconstruct phylogeny for many members of the Macaronesian flora. One such genus that has received attention recently is Tolpis (Asteraceae: Lactuceae). Sequences of the cpDNA gene ndhF provided strong support for a clade comprising species of Tolpis that are largely endemic to Macaronesia, to the exclusion of several European taxa that had previously been placed within the genus. Subsequently, cpDNA RFLP data were used to assess the biogeography and potential patterns of dispersal within the genus. However, relationships among species of Tolpis present on the Canary Islands were not well-resolved. Analyses of intersimple sequence repeat (ISSR) data were employed to assess relationships among species of Tolpis from the Canary Islands and Madeira. The five primers used across 80 individuals from 10 populations of seven species resulted in 48 bands that could be scored consistently. Neighbor-joining and parsimony analyses indicate close relationships among individuals within populations and differentiation among allopatric conspecific populations. In agreement with prior molecular results, the Canarian species form a well-supported group. Both neighbor-joining and parsimony analyses of ISSR markers resolve relationships (often with bootstrap support) among species, something that was not achieved previously. The present study demonstrates the potential of hypervariable single-locus markers for elucidating relationships in rapidly radiating lineages, many of which occur in oceanic archipelagos.
10.2307/3647450|Using plastid rbcL DNA sequences, we evaluated relationships of the monotypic genus Chiangiodendron (C. mexicanum), which has been thought to be the only New World member of Flacourtiaceae, tribe Pangieae, by some authors. The analysis consisted of two steps. In the first, we analyzed the rbcL sequence of Chiangiodendron in a large eudicot matrix (more than 500 representatives). Based on these results, a second, restricted analysis with 142 taxa was conducted. Chiangiodendron belongs to tribe Pangieae (which is now recognized as part of Achariaceae, whereas the rest of former Flacourtiaceae fall into Salicaceae s.l.), making Chiangiodendron the only American representative of that tribe. Its closest relatives are from Asia. Chiangiodendron is a relict of a wet-tropical Laurasian flora that has been preserved in Neotropical refugia.
10.2307/3647451|Stem and root anatomy of Hypericopsis persica is evaluated in light of molecular data reconstructing Hypericopsis within a clade of Asian Frankenia. No anatomical information contradicts the idea that Hypericopsis should be subsumed within Frankenia. Anatomy in the two genera is comparable, taking into account the unusual habit of Hypericopsis, which consists of slender, short-lived shoots from a long-lived caudex, whereas most species of Frankenia are small shrubs with long-lived shoots. Wood of the slender stems of Hypericopsis is similar to twig wood of the related Frankenia hirsuta in qualitative and quantitative features but differs from mature wood of other species of Frankenia described in previous studies in having smaller cells and little storying. Wood of Hypericopsis is rayless and is made up mostly of libriform fibers and vessel elements associated with vasicentric tracheids. Axial parenchyma is occasional at the margins of growth rings. We briefly evaluate wood characters in the context of Caryophyllales s.l. and suggest characters that may be synapomorphies of clades within this group, e.g., minute lateral wall pits apparently characterize the clade comprising Plumbaginaceae, Polygonaceae, Frankeniaceae, and Tamaricaceae. That vasicentric tracheids elongate considerably beyond the lengths of the vessel elements with which they are associated is cited as a distinct ontogenetic difference between these cell types. Likewise, numerous vessel elements comparable in diameter to vasicentric tracheids were observed. These observations are offered as reasons to reject the concept of vasicentric tracheids as simply vessel elements that are too narrow for the formation of perforation plates.
10.2307/3647452|We report the results from parsimony analyses of all 14 recognized species in Pericallis (Asteraceae, Senecioneae), one based on morphology and one based on combined data from morphology and molecular sequences of the nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) using gap coding. Pericallis is restricted to the Macaronesian archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean. Recently it was suggested that woodiness, a character frequently developed in vascular plants on oceanic islands, evolved twice in Pericallis and that the genus had a New World biogeographic affinity. A morphological study was therefore pertinent to test if the hypothesis of multiple origins of woodiness is supported by morphology and/or total evidence. Our results show an evidently young taxon with many polymorphic characters. Monophyly of Pericallis is strongly supported and a close relationship with the African genus Cineraria is suggested. It therefore seems plausible that Pericallis has a biogeographic affinity to Africa rather than to the New World. Morphology alone indicates that the ancestral state for Pericallis was woody. Combined data are indecisive if woodiness evolved several times, but an alternative explanation is that woodiness might have been a plesiomorphic character state present in a shrubby ancestor that once colonized Macaronesia. The herbaceous habit is a novelty, derived from woody ancestors. Pericallis tussilaginis, a herbaceous species, embodies conflicting phylogenetic signals; further research is needed to understand its origin. A clade of five taxonomically complex herbaceous species is postulated to have had recent origin and undergone rapid diversification.
10.2307/3647453|The genus Deeringothamnus (Annonaceae) comprises two species, D. pulchellus Small and D. rugelii (B. L. Rob.) Small; both are endemic to Florida, and federally listed as endangered. Field observations and experiments in central Florida determined their phenology, pollination, breeding system and germination. The species are protogynous, although there is an overlap of female and male stages in both. They are similar in floral morphology but differ in color and scent. They differ from Asimina in their small flowers with subequal petals and low number of stamens (16-34) with elongated connectives. They are both spring-flowering shrubs, but anthesis begins four to five weeks earlier in D. pulchellus. Fire or other disturbances enhances flowering dramatically. Pollinators are few and infrequent and may include flies, tumbling beetles, and thrips. Hand-pollination (self) resulted in 4.4% fruit set vs. 19.5-23.5% in hand-pollination (cross) and 1.6-1.8 % in open-pollinated flowers of D. rugelii. Open-pollinated flowers of D. pulchellus yielded 1.2% fruit set and 11.4% when they were hand-pollinated (cross). Over a six-year period, 80.5% of open-pollinated seeds of D. rugelii germinated and survived, vs. 42.6% in hand cross-pollinated and 34.8 % in hand self-pollinated. Two instances of natural intergeneric hybrids are described: A. pygmaea x D. rugelii and A. reticulata x D. pulchellus.
10.2307/3647454|Two main basic chromosome numbers occur in the majority of southern African Chloridoideae, i.e., 9 and 10, the majority being x = 10. Two main evolutionary pathways, one following x = 10 and the other following an aneuploid/dysploid reduction to x = 9 are suggested for the subfamily. Evidence indicates that x = 9, 10 are paleopolyploid basic chromosome numbers, with x = 10 derived from x = 5. This corresponds to the closely related Panicoideae where five is accepted as the basic chromosome number.
10.2307/3647455|New generic delimitations for Corethrodendron, Hedysarum, Sulla and Taverniera are proposed together with new infrageneric systems for Hedysarum, with special reference to morphological evidence. Hedysarum sect. Spinosissima is treated as a distinct genus Sulla, and H. sect. Hedysarum is newly circumscribed on the basis of its conserved type, H. alpinum. Hedysarum sections Crinifera, Multicaulia and Subacaulia are very similar to each other and are merged into an enlarged H. section Multicaulia. Hedysarum sect. Fruticosa is transferred to the genus Corethrodendron. On the other hand, Stracheya is reduced to a section of the genus Hedysarum. A key to the genera and the infrageneric taxa, their nomenclature, synonymy and short descriptions are provided.
10.2307/3647456|Ornithogalum umbratile (Sect. Ornithogalum), a new endemic species from Gargano (Apulia, Italy), is described on the basis of morphological, palynological and karyological characters as well as ecological tolerances. The species is usually hexaploid (2n = 54 + 0-4 accessory chromosomes), but occasionally heptaploid (2n = 63 + 1B). Differences with allied Italian taxa, especially O. etruscum, are discussed.
10.2307/3647458|Living trees of the early Cenozoic taxon Metasequoia glyptostroboides were first discovered in 1943. The first specimen that triggered its discovery, however, was lost. After three years of searching, we have located the first specimen stored in an unregistered, abandoned "herbarium" at the Jiangsu Forestry Academy (JFA), Nanjing, Jiangsu, China. This first specimen was collected by C. Wang (number 118) on 21 Jul 1943 from a large tree at Modaoxi, Wan Xian, Sichuan, also known as the type tree since the type was collected from the same tree by C. J. Hsueh in 1946.
10.2307/3647459|Indigofera confusa is an illegitimate name and a case is made for its replacement by I. pretoriana Harms. Confusion over the status of both names is clarified.
10.2307/3647460|Morphological and karyological features show that Festuca vizzavonae and F. rubra var. cyrnea St. Yves & Litard. are taxonomic synonyms and that F. vizzavonae would be the correct name for this taxon at the rank of species. As this name has, however, been generally considered synonymous with F. alpina subsp. briquetii (/F. alfrediana), this would result in a confusing, and therefore disadvantageous, nomenclatural change. A proposal to reject F. vizzavonae is, therefore, being made.
10.2307/3647461|Dolichostegia Schlechter, the name of a monotypic genus endemic to the Philippines, is lectotypified and the lectotype described and illustrated. Synonymy of Dolichostegia with Dischidia is accepted and a new combination, Dischidia boholensis (Schlechter) Livshultz, is made. The most likely type locality for D. boholensis, and for other R. C. McGregor specimens from Bohol, is limestone hill forest near Guindulman, in the south-eastern corner of the island.
10.2307/3647463|A survey of the use of two common suffixes of generic names and species epithets in botanical nomenclature is provided and discrepancies in treatment, either in the form of the stem or in the gender, are demonstrated. The reasons for these discrepancies and their consequences are outlined and possible means of harmonization are indicated.
10.2307/3647464|Neotypes for Poa scariosa Lag. and Festuca fenas Lag. are designated here.
10.2307/3647465|Lectotypes for twenty names currently included in Tortula Hedw. are designated here. Tortula santorinensis Schiffn. is considered to be conspecific with T. solmsii (Schimp.) Limpr., of which it becomes a synonym, and T. eucalyptrata Lindb. conspecific with T. euryphylla R. H. Zander ( T. latifolia (Hedw.) Lindb., nom. illeg.), over which it has priority. In addition, the following infraspecific taxa, sometimes accepted in current literature, are not considered to be recognisable taxonomically, and are synonymized under the Tortula species involved: Desmatodon latifolius var. muticus (Brid.) Brid. ( Dicranum latifolium var. muticum Brid.) (= Tortula eucalyptrata), Tortula cuneifolia var. marginata M. Fleisch., T. muralis f. incana (Schimp.) Sapjegin ( Barbula muralis var. incana Schimp.), and T. revolvens var. obtusata Reimers.
10.2307/3647466|The author of the species name Agave wercklei is Carlos Werckl who validly published this name in 1907, not Frdric Albert Constantin Weber as has been indicated in various botanical works. As Werckl attributed the name to Weber, the full citation, retaining historical information linked to this name, is A. wercklei F. A. C. Weber ex Werckl.
10.2307/3647342|Flower orientation, the angle between a flower's main axis and the horizontal, is an important but understudied flower trait. I explore the relationship between flower orientation, hummingbird pollination, and rain, and review evidence for the adaptive significance of a down-facing orientation as a mechanism to avoid flower flooding. A screening of a tropical and a temperate flora showed that hummingbird flowers more commonly face down than insect flowers. In the temperate forests of southern South America, genera pollinated by hummingbirds and genera with down-facing flowers-irrespective of pollination mode-increase along a strong E-W precipitation gradient across the Andes. These patterns suggest that flowers with a down-facing orientation are associated with pollinators that, like hummingbirds, remain active during rain and that this type of flower orientation may constitute an adaptation against the deleterious effects of nectar dilution and pollen rainwash. Still scarce experimental evidence confirms that a down-facing morphology may prevent flower flooding. However, other morphological traits, like corolla closure and a narrow tubular shape, could also be effective in hindering nectar dilution and pollen rainwash.
10.2307/3647343|A brief overview of arthropod/insect evolution with particular emphasis on herbivory provides the starting point for discussion of increased herbivory over time. The term "flower" is defined, and it is noted that angiosperm flowers are distinguished by their edibility. It is observed that the phenomenon of florivory is a primary plant-animal interaction, and pollination, as one possible outcome of the eating of flowers, is a secondary phenomenon. An hypothesis reconciling the facts that angiosperms are the most eaten of all plant groups and the most successful in term of number of species is proposed. From the perspective of a floral morphologist, I discuss what a generalist flower is and how archaic angiosperms are characterized by this flower type. Biodiversity arguments underpin a discourse on why researchers should investigate generalist flowers and florivory.
10.2307/3647344|Classes of blossoms (here defined as pollination units, flowers, inflorescences, or flower-inflorescences) of two classification systems (Leppik, 1969, and Faegri & van der Pijl, 1979) were evaluated for 1,495 samples from 1,235 plant species according to pollination unit, pollination system specialization (polyphily, oligophily, monophily, and anemophily) and pollinating agent classes. Residual analysis of blossom classes according to the Leppik system showed that: polyphilous flowers are pleomorphic and stereomorphic; polyphilous inflorescences are haplomorphic; monophilous flowers are zygomorphic; and anemophilous inflorescences are amorphic. Pleomorphic flowers are pollinated by bees, flies, and wasps; stereomorphic flowers are pollinated by bees, butterflies, moths, birds, and bats; zygomorphic flowers are pollinated by bees, and beetles; and amorphic inflorescences are wind- and beetle-pollinated species. Residual analysis of blossom classes according to the Faegri & van der Pijl system showed that: polyphilous flowers are mostly dish-, bell-, and tube-blossom types; monophilous flowers are flag-, gullet-, and trap-blossom types; and inflorescence anemophilous are brush-blossom type. Dish-flowers are pollinated by bees, flies, and wasps; tube-flowers are pollinated by butterflies, moths, and birds; flag- and gullet-flowers are pollinated by bees; brush-inflorescences are pollinated by wind; and trap-inflorescences are pollinated by beetles. Relationships between blossom types (Leppik vs. Faegri & van der Pijl) are statistically significant: (1) amorphic and haplomorphic, are each associated with brush-blossoms, (2) actinomorphic and pleomorphic blossoms are each associated with dish-blossoms, (3) tube and bell-blossoms are associated with stereomorphic blossoms, and (4) zygomorphic and paramorphic blossoms are each associated with flag- and gullet-blossoms. Further, statistically significant differences were found in fruit set in relation to pollination unit, and among blossom types in both the Faegri & van der Pijl and the Leppik systems. Inflorescences produced significantly more fruit per flower than the pollination unit alone of flower or flower-inflorescence. Gullet-shaped blossoms exhibit the lowest fruit set; the highest fruit set is found in inconspicuous and trap-blossoms. The lowest values for fruit set are found for zygomorphic and paramorphic blossoms, and the highest are haplomorphic and actinomorphic blossoms.
10.2307/3647345|The Annonaceae show a broader flower biological radiation than originally thought, with flowers being pollinated not only by beetles, but also by thrips, flies and even bees. The majority of species have hermaphroditic protogynous flowers. Species with white or yellowish-white, small, delicate, day-active flowers, may be pollinated either solely by thrips, or by thrips and small beetles (e.g., species of Bocageopsis, Oxandra, Xylopia). Several of these thrips-pollinated species have stamens with an elongated, tongue-like connective. Pollination by flies is not well documented for American species, notwithstanding it appears to be more common in Old World species, e.g., in the genus Pseuduvaria. The mitriform flowers exhale an unpleasant smell, produce nectar in purple-colored petal glands and have a sapromyiophilous syndrome. Flies enter the flower center through large openings between the inner petals. Beetle-pollinated Annonaceae have flowers with comparatively thick and, often, fleshy petals, which, during anthesis frequently form a pollination chamber with the petals inclining over the flower center. The stamens usually have peltate connective shields, probably a device for protection against voracious beetles. Some cantharophilous species have flowers which are day-active while others are night-active. When they are in their pistillate phase, the beetles are attracted by characteristic odor components. They enter the pollination chamber and usually remain in the interior of the flower until the flower has changed to its staminate phase, when pollen is shed and afterwards petals and stamens detach. Two lines of cantharophilous Annonaceae are recognizable on the basis of present knowledge. Species with smaller and more delicate flowers are pollinated by small beetles (Nitidulidae, Curculionidae, Chrysomelidae and Staphylinidae), whereas species with large, more robust flowers in the Neotropics are pollinated by large beetles of the family Scarabaeidae, subfamily Dynastinae. Some species of the cantharophilous Annonaceae, especially the large-flowered ones, but also some species with smaller flowers, produce heat during anthesis (thermogenesis). Food bodies, developed on the adaxial surfaces or sides of the petals, provide unique nourishment possibilities for beetles when they stay inside the flowers during the pistillate phase. In the staminate stage of the flower, after pollen is shed, beetles also feed on pollen. Apparently, no dynastid-flower relationship has evolved in Asia and Australia. Pollination by bees was discovered recently in Unonopsis guatterioides in Amazonia and Uvaria concava in North Queensland: the first by scent-collecting euglossine males and the second by pollen-collecting Meliponinae. The general trends in morphological/functional floral characteristics in the family are discussed in a presumptive phylogenetic context.
10.2307/3647346|Boraginaceae have erroneously been associated with helicoid cymes, when upon closer inspection they exclusively possess scorpioid cymes (cincinni). A discussion of the inflorescence structure in Boraginaceae is presented with the help of an overview of monochasial branching systems and a three-dimensional representation thereof. Reasons for the incorrect description of Boraginaceae inflorescences are also provided.
10.2307/3647347|A phylogenetic analysis of Echiochilon and representatives of Antiphytum and Ogastemma based on nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences of the ribosomal DNA indicated that zygomorphy is the plesiomorphic condition in Echiochilon. Antiphytum and Ogastemma were resolved as sister taxa, together forming the sister group to Echiochilon. An analysis based on morphological data mainly corroborates the ITS phylogeny, with a notable exception concerning the position of the actinomorphic-flowered E. johnstonii. Biogeographic interpretation of the ITS phylogeny using DIVA (dispersal vicariance analysis) indicated an ancestor to Echiochilon with a wide distribution over northern Africa and Arabia to India.
10.2307/3647348|Polyploidy is frequent among the grasses. This study indicates that it has a high frequency in the subfamily Chloridoideae, where more than 90% of the studied specimens are polyploids. These levels range from diploid (2n = 20 for x = 10 and 2n = 18 for x = 9) to 16-ploid (2n = 160) for x = 10 in Ctenium concinnum Nees and 20-ploid (2n = 180) for x = 9 in Hilaria mutica Benth. This polyploid trend is seen in southern Africa, as well as worldwide. Analysis indicates that many polyploids are alloploids, suggesting extensive hybridization within this group. This is supported by the presence of apomixis in many members of the subfamily. Both polyploidy and apomixis are thought to be important evolutionary mechanisms in Chloridoideae as well as closely related Panicoideae, and have a high frequency in southern Africa. Due to the stable ecological, geographical and climatological history of Africa, the continent is ideally suited for the stabilization of hybrid complexes by means of apomixis and polyploidization.
10.2307/3647349|Pandanaceae are an ancient family of dioecious monocots dating from the early to mid-Cretaceous, and comprising three extant genera Sararanga, Freycinetia and Pandanus. We present a cladistic analysis of Pandanaceae based on DNA sequences of four cpDNA fragments (the trnL intron and three intergenic spacers, trnL-F, trnS-ycf9 and atpB-rbcL) in order to elucidate intergeneric relationships within the family. The results show that Pandanus, as currently circumscribed, is biphyletic, with members of the Indian Ocean subg. Martellidendron sister to the Indo-Malesian genus Freycinetia in a clade that also includes the Malesian genus Sararanga, and that the remaining members of Pandanus form a separate well supported clade. Martellidendron is thus recognized as a distinct genus, thereby circumscribing a monophyletic Pandanus. Martellidendron comprises seven species (for which new combinations are proposed). The high level of morphological differentiation between the genera of Pandanaceae suggests rapid early radiation as seen in other monocot groups. The molecular data also indicate that the distinct lineages of Pandanaceae in the Indian Ocean basin are likely the result of both vicariance (Martellidendron) and more recent step-wise long-distance dispersal from Asia across the Indian Ocean (e.g., monocarpellate spiniform species in lowland eastern Madagascar).
10.2307/3647350|Physotheca autoica J. J. Engel & Gradst. is a liverwort genus and species new to science and is endemic to the Andes of southern Ecuador. The new genus, while having several characters also found in the family Geocalycaceae, differs from members of that family in a number of important respects, which are discussed. The mode of growth of Physotheca is unusual, and occurs strictly by repeated innovations originating from below the bracts or bracteoles of the gynoecium. The inflated, bladder-like perianths are noteworthy, and have a shape and form that is remarkably similar to the sterile perianths of the unrelated genus Pleurozia. Capsule wall anatomy is also unusual, the walls are 7-8-stratose, and the outer layer, which has both one-phase and two-phase development represented, readily collapses. The large spores (to nearly 39 m) are echinate and nearly three times the elater width, and the elaters, which frequently uncoil, adhere in considerable number to the inner face of the capsule wall. The best placement of Physotheca is within the family Geocalycaceae. Due to the unusual combination of these and other characters, the genus does not fit into any of the known sub-families of Geocalycaceae and must be placed in a new subfamily, Physothecoideae J.J. Engel & Gradst.
10.2307/3647351|Selection of a type species for the wide-ranging genus Hedyotis (Hedyotideae; Rubiaceae) has involved a long-standing controversy over two species, Hedyotis auricularia L. and H. fruticosa L. Nomenclatural and morphological data support the selection of H. fruticosa as type. The choice of H. auricularia would have caused considerable taxonomic confusion by upsetting previously established names and overturning the names of the many species of Oldenlandia. The General Committee on nomenclature recently has approved Hedyotis fruticosa as the conserved type of Hedyotis. The morphology and taxonomy of the genus Exallage, based on H. auricularia, is surveyed, and we conclude that at least three of the species are better treated as a new subgenus of Oldenlandia. The synonymy of these species is listed, and two new combinations are published in the genus Oldenlandia. A detailed survey of the species related to Hedyotis fruticosa begins with the 24 Sri Lankan species, most of which exhibit morphological characters similar to Hedyotis fruticosa. The capsules of these species have been termed diplophragmous in allusion to the partial apical loculicidal dehiscence followed by complete septicidal dehiscence, resulting in two separate capsular halves or cocci. The seeds of these species are dorsiventrally compressed with a ventral hilar ridge topped by a punctiform apical hilum. Many other Asian and Pacific, particularly Micronesian, species show similar diplophragmous capsules and fruticosa-type seeds. The recognition of this newly circumscribed group, Hedyotis subgenus Hedyotis, ranging from China and India to Micronesia, establishes a firm basis for comparative studies of Hawaiian and American species, which are known to differ in morphology from the typical subgenus.
10.2307/3647352|The Cardamine pratensis group is a taxonomically critical species complex with pronounced karyological and morphological variation. In the present study, representatives from the Iberian Peninsula have been investigated using karyological, morphometric and molecular (amplified fragment length polymorphism) analyses. As a result of this combined approach, three species are recognized in the area studied: C. pratensis s.str., C. crassifolia, and a herein newly described species, C. castellana. For C. pratensis s.str., consistent with the pattern known from other European regions, wide variation in chromosome numbers is revealed, consisting of diploid to heptaploid populations in northern and central parts of the Peninsula. Little morphological and genetic differentiation accompanies these cytotypes. Re-evaluation of populations up to now ascribed to C. crassifolia reveal two separate taxa: (1) populations from the Eastern Pyrenees, representing typical C. crassifolia, and (2) those from central Iberian mountains treated as C. castellana. These two diploid taxa differ in several quantitative morphological characters, as well as in morphology of rhizome and basal parts of stem, and they are also distinct in AFLP markers, indicating strong genetic differentiation.
10.2307/3647354|For the Flora of North America, Smith & Flory (2002) recognized 15 species and four infraspecific taxa of Hymenocallis in the southeastern United States from Texas and Oklahoma east to Virginia. Here we justify the selection of names used for these taxa in the Flora of North America treatment and typify those names.
10.2307/3647355|Heinrich Wilhelm Buek described 34 new species and two new varieties of South African Campanulaceae, based on the collections of C. F. Ecklon and C. Zeyher and published in their Enumeratio Plantarum Africae Australis Extratropicae in 1837. Holotypes for the names of these taxa have been identified in the herbarium of the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm, Sweden (S). The types are provided with Buek's handwritten descriptions agreeing more or less verbatim with those published. The only species not belonging to Campanulaceae, viz. Merciera heteromorpha H. Buek, is lectotypified. The new combination Wahlenbergia thunbergii (Schult.) B. Nord. is introduced for the widespread species known as W. uitenhagensis (H. Buek) Lammers and new combinations are made for its two varieties. Lightfootia ciliata var. major Sond. and Roella eckloniana var. pubescens Sond. are lectotypified.
10.2307/3647356|Commelina scandens C.B. Clarke and Commelina purpurea C.B. Clarke were typified by syntypes that belong to different species. Accordingly, each species is lectotypified, and the taxonomic consequences of the lectotypifications are discussed. Commelina scandens is lectotypified by a specimen from Angola, with the result that the species is confined to continental Africa. A new subspecies, Commelina diffusa Burm.f. subsp. violacea Faden, is described for the Madagascan element in Clarke's C. scandens. Commelina purpurea is lectotypified by the syntype from Kenya, resulting in C. lugardii Bullock and C. kabarensis De Wild. being placed in synonymy under C. purpurea. The other element in Clarke's C. purpurea is described as a new species C. pseudopurpurea Faden.
10.2307/3647357|This article deals with the lectotypification of Elaphoglossum tomentosum and E. heterolepis. Both names apply to species of leptosporangiate ferns from the Mascarene Islands. The typification of these names is clarified to establish their correct application for a revision of the Mascarene Elaphoglossum species.
10.2307/3647358|A taxonomic review is presented of the taxa of the genus Cyrtopodium R. Br. (Orchidaceae) recently described by L. C. Menezes. As the types of most of the names of these taxa are vegetative specimens, and therefore generally useless for specific recognition, the authors designate epitypes for eight of them: C. aureum L. C. Menezes, C. braemii L. C. Menezes, C. caiapoense L. C. Menezes, C. cipoense L. C. Menezes, C. fowliei L. C. Menezes, C. holstii L. C. Menezes, C sarneyanum L. C. Menezes, and C. withneri L. C. Menezes. Furthermore, C. sarneyanum L. C. Menezes, C. paludicolum var. goiandirense L. C. Menezes, C. paranaense var. pickelii Hoehne, and C. vernum var. fulvum L. C. Menezes are placed in synonymy of C. braemii L. C. Menezes, C. paludicolum Hoehne, C. andersonii (Lamb. ex Andrews) R. Br., and C. poecilum Rchb. f. & Warm., respectively. Since the distribution of terrestrial species of Cyrtopodium is strongly correlated with soil type, soil humidity, and surrounding vegetation, comments on habitat preferences of most species are also given.
10.2307/3647360|Article 18.5 and Art. 18.6 of the present International Code of Botanical Nomenclature authorise the use of alternative names in the following eight cases of families of flowering plants: Compositae/Asteraceae, Cruciferae/Brassicaceae, Gramineae/Poaceae, Guttiferae/Clusiaceae, Labiatae/Lamiaceae, Leguminosae/Fabaceae, Palmae/Arecaceae, and Umbelliferae/Apiaceae. The first name in each of these pairs is not based on the name of an included genus, and permission to use these names under the Code has become increasingly controversial in recent years. Our present note looks briefly at the history of the alternative usages and then aims to indicate the extent to which the two alternatives are used in the literature today, laying a basis for any potential discussion of future action. A strong case is noted for maintaining Leguminosae rather than Fabaceae when this family is treated in a broad sense.
10.2307/3647361|The long overlooked synonym Lycopodium "minchegense" Ching has one month's priority over Phlegmariurus mingcheensis Ching on which Huperzia mingcheensis (Ching) Holub is based. It is argued that the older binomial has a typesetter's error (misplaced "g") and is correctable to L. mingcheense. A new combination in Huperzia would be a later homonym of Holub's combination. A lectotype is designated for L. mingcheense.
10.2307/3647362|Rhizocaulon R. C. Mehrotra (fossil ?Araceae) is a later homonym of Rhizocaulon Saporta (fossil ?Poaceae) published in 1861 and is, therefore, illegitimate. A new generic name Rhizocaulites is proposed here as a replacement.
10.2307/4135484|The origin of the angiosperms has long remained problematical. Recent new discoveries of early angiosperm fossils and many new molecular phylogenies have helped to identify basal extant angiosperms and to infer their inter-relationships. Still unclear, however, are ties with gymnosperms, both living and fossil. In view of difficulty of finding ancestors for angiosperms, yet also considering their sudden appearance and explosive evolutionary success, a transitional-combinational theory is proposed. This theory suggests that angiosperms evolved slowly from seed ferns in the Jurassic beginning first with the carpel, followed later by double fertilization, and lastly by the appearance of flowers. These three fundamental transitions may have taken more than 100 million years to complete. The extant (or modern) angiosperms did not appear until Early Cretaceous, as attested by micro- and macrofossils, when the final combination of all three important angiosperm features occurred. This combination provided the opportunity for explosive evolutionary diversification, especially in response to selection from insect pollinators and predators, plus attendant modifications in compatibility and breeding systems. The transitional-combinational theory explains some of the discrepancy between fossil and molecular phylogenetic data, the latter of which suggests that angiosperms originated pre-Cretaceous. DNA (and protein) sequence data and oleananes reflect ancestry in an earlier transitional carpellate lineage (or lineages), much earlier than appearance of the final combination that includes floral and associated pollen modifications. The theory suggests viewing all gymnosperms, other than extinct seed ferns from which carpels arose, as having had no direct phvlogenetic connections to modern angiosperms.
10.2307/4135485| Phylogenetic hypotheses for the largely South African genus Pelargonium L'Hr. (Geraniaceae) were derived based on DNA sequence data from nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrial encoded regions. The datasets were unequally represented and comprised cpDNA trnL-F sequences for 152 taxa, nrDNA ITS sequences for 55 taxa, and mtDNA nad1 b/c exons for 51 taxa. Phylogenetic hypotheses derived from the separate three datasets were overall congruent. A single hypothesis synthesising the information in the three datasets was constructed following a total evidence approach and implementing dataset specific stepmatrices in order to correct for substitution biases. Pelargonium was found to consist of five main clades, some with contrasting evolutionary patterns with respect to biogeographic distributions, dispersal capacity, pollination biology and karyological diversification. The five main clades are structured in two (subgeneric) clades that correlate with chromosome size. One of these clades includes a "winter rainfall clade" containing more than 70% of all currently described Pelargonium species, and all restricted to the South African Cape winter rainfall region. Apart from (woody) shrubs and small herbaceous rosette subshrubs, this clade comprises a large "xerophytic" clade including geophytes, stem and leaf succulents, harbouring in total almost half of the genus. This clade is considered to be the result of in situ proliferation, possibly in response to late-Miocene and Pliocene aridification events. Nested within it is a radiation comprising c. 80 species from the geophytic Pelargonium section Hoarea, all characterised by the possession of (a series of) tunicate tubers. 
10.2307/4135486|Sequence data from a portion of the Granule-Bound Starch Synthase I (GBSSI) gene or waxy, were used to infer the phylogeny of the core Asian Araliaceae clade. The amplified region included exons 10 and 11 together with the intervening intron. The level of intrageneric variation was low (~2%) relative to that among genera (4-5%). Two main paralogous copies of waxy were revealed by sequencing cloned PCR products for Oreopanax floribundum, O. capitatus, Tetrapanax papyrifer, and Schefflera delavayi, which might be the result of gene duplication or polyploidy. Analyses based on parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods supported several clades, including Brassaiopsis with Trevesia, Macropanax with Metapanax, Eleutherococcus with Kalopanax, and Panax with Aralia. Analyses also suggested a possible relationship between Tetrapanax papyrifer and Schefflera delavayi within the Asian core Araliaceae. The waxy phylogeny was largely congruent with the topologies based on previous analyses of nuclear ribosomal ITS and chloroplast ndhF data. The phylogenetic inference from each waxy copy was similar, although both copies were not recovered for all species sampled. It is concluded that with special consideration and care given to detecting and accounting for the presence of multiple copies, waxy can provide information within Araliaceae. However, efforts should now be directed towards exploring a larger portion of the gene, particularly the 5' region.
10.2307/4135487|A new hybrid combination is reported here between two highly divergent (and taxonomically controversial) species, A. robusta (from the basally divergent A. palus tris group) and A. fragrans (from the more derived A. coriophora group); this plant, originating from the Albufera wetlands in Mallorca, is here named A. xalbuferensis R.M. Bateman, nothosp. nov. Sequencing of nuclear ITS and plastid trnL regions, together with PCR-RFLP analysis of the ITS region, confirm the suspected parentage of the hybrid and identify A. fragrans as the seed-parent. Production of this hybrid is therefore inferred to have required a minimum travel distance of ca 100 m by the pollen vector from the closest presently available pollen-parent of A. robusta. As usual in orchids, the hybrid is intermediate between its parents in the majority of the 57 morphometric characters scored, but it more closely resembles its mother in three times more characters than its father. Placing this new combination in the context of other records of hybridisation in subtribe Orchidinae provides further evidence of the genetic cohesion of the genus Anacamptis, which was recently expanded to include approximately one third of the species previously assigned to Orchis s.l.
10.2307/4135488| Floral adaptation to pollination by bats is rare in Acanthaceae and only known from neotropical species. Two novel cases are described in detail from field observations. Harpochilus neesianus, a shrub endemic in NE Brazil, with long emergent thyrses, was seen being regularly visited by hovering glossophagine bats (Glossophaga soricina). Its large, pale lemon-green corollas are strongly bilabiate, a shape uncommon in the syndrome. The lower lip segments are recurved and the upper lip is reduced to a narrow, arcuate, tubular organ serving to support stamens and style. A sour, cabbage-like odour is released, and copious nectar is secreted by a voluminous disk. Pollen is transferred by the bat's upper, rear surface. Anthesis is confined to a single night. Chiropterophily in Ruellia eurycodon is deduced from the floral syndrome. The flowers of this shrub, studied in Goys, Central Brazil, share the same features as Harpochilus except for the corolla shape, which conforms to the "short bell type" frequent in neotropical bat flowers. Based on literature sources, bat pollination is also predicted for Ruellia malaca and R. exostemma from Venezuela. The occurrence of this floral type in other genera of the family is briefly surveyed. 
10.2307/4135489|Monophyly and sister group relationship of Ceropegieae and Marsdenieae, the two Asclepiadoideae tribes possessing erect pollinia, are confirmed by molecular investigation of non-coding cpDNA markers (trnT-L and trnL-F spacers, and the trnL intron). In Ceropegieae, the analyzed taxa fall in four subclades. The Heterostemma subclade is sister to other three subclades, of which the Conomitra-Leptadenia-Orthanthera subclade is sister to the Anisotoma-Neoschumannia-Riocreuxia-Sisyranthus subclade and to the large subclade comprising the stem-succulent stapeliads, Brachystelma and Ceropegia. Following these results, subdivision of Ceropegieae into four subtribes, Anisotominae, Heterostemminae, Leptadeniinae and Stapeliinae, is proposed.
10.2307/4135490|Recent studies using regions of the nuclear and plastid genomes have shown that T. H. Goodspeed's sectional groupings in Nicotiana are for the large part upheld. However, we have shown that in several cases sectional membership should be revised. Here we present a revised outline of the sections of Nicotiana with lists of their component species. Relationships of the sections as defined can be seen in accompanying figures. Two sectional names with priority over those in current use are introduced (N. sect. Polydicliae & sect. Petunioides) and one new section, N. sect. Sylvestres, is described here. Two species names are changed to those with priority over those adopted by Goodspeed in his monograph of the genus: N. obtusifolia for N. trigonophylla and N. quadrivalvis for N. bigelovii. Synonymies are provided for each of these names. A short morphological description is provided for each section, along with a generalized distribution and a list of accepted species names.
10.2307/4135491|Paeonia saueri D. Y. Hong, X. Q. Wang et D. M. Zhang is described as a new species from Greece and Albania based on population sampling, statistics, chromosome observation, and SEM observations. It is characterized by tuberous roots, a high number of leaflets/segments, adaxially setulose along the veins on leaves, and a chromosome number of 2n = 20. It is closely related to P. peregrina. However, as shown by cluster analysis (Fig. 3) and principal coordinate analysis (Fig. 4), it differs distinctly from the latter in having mostly entire leaflets/segments that are hispidulous beneath, and red stigmas. From P. officinalis it differs in having the leaves setulose along the veins above and sparsely hispidulous below, and the stems, petioles and sepals always glabrous. Furthermore, it differs from those two species by its relatively short and wide follicles. The somatic chromosome number of the new species, 2n = 20, is reported here for the first time.
10.2307/4135492| DNA sequence data were generated for the nuclear ITS region for Symphysia racemosa and for 26 additional Vaccinieae representing 12 sections in the genus Vaccinium plus one species from each of five additional segregate genera. Our focus is on the placement of S. racemosa relative to Vaccinium sensu stricto and Vaccinium sect. Oreades (represented by V. poasanum). Maximum parsimony analysis of 608 bp of nrITS region suggests that S. racemosa and V. poasanum form a well-supported clade in spite of substantial morphological divergence. Furthermore, this clade is a sister group to a clade consisting of all segregate genera examined. These molecular results led us to undertake a morphological cladistic analysis of all of the other Central American green-flowered taxa. We suggest that the genus Symphysia should be expanded to encompass these 15 taxa, despite the lack of phylogenetic resolution within this group. This will necessitate eight new combinations, viz., Symphysia almedae (= V almedae), Symphysia costaricensis (= V. costaricense), Symphysia jefensis (= V. jefense), Symphysia orosiensis (= V. orosiense), Symphysia ovata (= Lateropora ovata), Symphysia perardua (= V. santafensis), Symphysia poasana (= Vaccinium poasanum), Symphysia santafensis (= L. santafensis), and Symphysia tubulifera (= L. tubulifera). 
10.2307/4135493| Paepalanthus Mart., the largest genus of Eriocaulaceae, has been shown to be polyphyletic by all the phylogenetic analyses performed so far in the family. After intensive and extensive field work and an analysis of various characters in a recent revision of Paepalanthus section Actinocephalus (Krn.) Ruhland, I encountered consistent evidence that this group should be elevated to generic status. This proposal, meant to bring a better comprehension of this group within the family, is supported by the phylogenetic analyses of Giulietti et al. (1995, 2000) that show the group to be monophyletic. Actinocephalus (Krn.) Sano, as proposed here, contains 28 species. The necessary nomenclatural changes are made for the new status, with 28 new combinations proposed, 17 new synonyms, eight lectotypifications, five stati novi and one new name. Actinocephalus (Krn.) Sano is characterized principally by inflorescences composed of capitula in umbels and in having a geographic range restricted to Brazil. 
10.2307/4135494|The monotypic genus Amblysperma has been distinguished from Trichocline by previous authors on the basis of differences in geographic distribution, involucre shape, corolla colour, limb indumentum of the marginal corollas, anther filament surface, type of staminode basal appendages, and achenial shape. However, a critical re-examination of these characters reveals that most of them are shared between both genera. The presence of twin hairs in the corollas of Amblysperma and Trichocline is another character linking both genera. Differences in geographic distribution, i.e., Amblysperma in Australia and Trichocline in South America, and shape of the involucre provided the only distinguishing features which do not appear to justify the recognition of two different genera. Amblysperma is therefore placed in synonymy with Trichocline.
10.2307/4135495|Knowledge claims in comparative biology are interpretations/explanations (propositions) of facts. These facts help us to discover the interrelationships amongst taxa and areas. Relationships are information disseminated in the form of language. Propositions, in cladistics and cladistic biogeography, are based on congruence. In a cladogram, for instance, congruent apomorphic character-states form a synapomorphy. Synapomorphies may be treated as topographical units that depict evolutionary relationships (synchrony) or evolutionary events (diachrony). In cladistic biogeographical and systematic theory, synchronic and diachronic statements of relationships conflict in their interpretation of non-congruence. Comparative biology needs a meaningful language, for without it conflict becomes congruence and non-information becomes knowledge.
10.2307/4135496|The Southern African Botanical Diversity Network (SABONET) is a donor-funded capacity-building project supported by the GEF-UNDP and USAID/IUCN ROSA. The ten southern African countries that make up the network are Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Participating institutions in these countries are involved in the compilation of national plant checklists, production of botanical inventories for centres of plant diversity, regional and national plant collecting expeditions, computerisation of herbarium specimens, support of postgraduate studies in systematics, biodiversity research projects, regional and national training courses and workshops, implementation of threatened plants programmes in botanical gardens and the compilation of Plant Red Data Lists. Since the inception of the Project in 1996, these efforts have contributed positively towards networking and capacity-building among botanists and providing baseline information for the in situ and ex situ conservation of the flora of the southern African region. This paper discusses the lessons learned during the implementation of the project up to December 2002 and outlines the contribution SABONET has made towards building the capacity of focal institutions in southern Africa. It also highlights the main strengths of the project and provides a 20-point plan for a successful regional network. Other issues that pertain to the SABONET Project are discussed under challenges and opportunities, constraints to improvement and complementing other networks. It is hoped that this paper will provide some insight into the experience of southern Africa in documenting biodiversity. By evaluating our successes and failures we hope the findings presented in this paper will serve as guidelines for other projects to accomplish even more than we had.
10.2307/4135497|The importance of documenting the plants of Mexico is undeniable considering its status as a country with biological megadiversity on one hand and the accelerated destruction of its ecosystems on the other. Ten years ago we started to compile species lists and literature for the monocotyledons that grow in Mexico, in an attempt to at least partially remedy the current lack of botanical knowledge that exists in the country. Individual electronic databases of nomenclature, bibliography, and herbarium specimens were developed. Currently these databases contain 15,560, 6,700, and 42,000 records, respectively. To date we have registered for the country 4,529 species (or 4,797 taxa including subspecies and varieties) distributed in 619 genera and 60 families (sensu Dahlgren & al., 1985). Of the total number of families, seven include only introduced representatives, whereas the other 53 possess at least some native species. The number of native species is 4,424 (4,693 taxa including subspecies and varieties). A comparison of the data obtained by us together with data reported in various floristic lists of Mexican states, as well as that from some completed regional floras, allows us to obtain statistical estimates that indicate Mexico should possess between 21,300 and 24,601 species of angiosperms. As a final perspective on the importance of the Mexican flora, if the estimate of number of seed plant species in the world is really 223,300 (Scotland & Wortley, 2003), and if we accept the estimate of number of species for Mexico as 24,601, then Mexico would have 11.01 % of the total seed plant species diversity of the entire planet.
10.2307/4135498|The number of studies dealing with plant invasions is increasing rapidly, but the accumulating body of knowledge has unfortunately also spawned increasing confusion about terminology. Invasions are a global phenomenon and comparison of geographically distant regions and their introduced biota is a crucially important methodological approach for elucidation of the determinants of invasiveness and invasibility. Comparative studies of alien floras provide substantial new insights to our understanding of general patterns of plant invasions. Such studies, using information in previously published floras and checklists, are fundamentally dependent on the quality of the assessment of particular species with respect to their taxonomic identity, time of immigration and invasion status. Three crucial decisions should be made when defining the status of a plant species in a given region: (1) whether the taxon is native or alien to that region (origin status); (2) what is its position in the invasion process, i.e., when was it introduced (residence status); and (3) what is the degree of its naturalization and possible invasion (invasion status). Standard floras differ hugely in their treatment of non-native species and those with appropriate categorization of alien species according to their status are rather rare. The present paper suggests definitions of terms associated with plant invasions and places these into the context of floras. Recommendations are outlined on how to deal with the issue of plant invasions in standard floras with the aim of contributing to a better understanding between taxonomists and ecologists and allowing more detailed comparative analyses of alien floras of various regions of the world.
10.2307/4135499|The Monocot Checklist Project is a five year project started in April 2001 that aims to create an electronic database containing all accepted monocot taxa and their synonyms, together with their geographical distribution and lifeform. The procedure used to compile the database is described and the standards used are listed. The projected outputs are listed and specific reference is made to how individuals can contribute to the completion and maintenance of the data.
10.2307/4135500|A polymorphic non-coding region of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from herbarium specimens of Pinus brutia and P. halepensis. The samples belong to the historical collection of Michele Tenore. Several discordances and inconsistencies in taxonomic attribution are present for historical specimens of P brutia. Moreover, there are inaccuracies as to their geographical distribution. In this work, we demonstrate the potential use of molecular methods of amplifying DNA from historical samples to resolve the identification of herbarium specimens.
10.2307/4135501|As a follow-up to the 2001 Smithsonian Botanical Symposium, in late June of 2002 a group of 15 taxonomists took part in a Workshop entitled "Linnaean Nomenclature in the 21st Century" at the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation in Pittsburgh to discuss integrating phylogenetic information into the current systems of naming plants, animals, and microorganisms. The Hunt Group included a diversity of taxonomists, including traditional and phylogenetic practitioners as well as authorities on the current codes and end-users of nomenclatural rules. The discussion ranged from identifying problems and possible solutions to devising strategies for implementing change. It was concluded that the central problems revolve around the concepts of (1) circumscribing taxa, (2) hierarchical ranking, and (3) the use of binomials. In a critical article-by-article examination of the current edition of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature it was found that only 14 of the total 62 articles (plus appendices) are relevant to whether or not classification is phylogenetic. Furthermore, each of these potentially problematic articles is either amenable to conveying phylogenetic information or neutral to phylogenetic considerations. There is nothing in the current Linnaean nomenclature that prevents cladistic information from being incorporated into the naming procedure. We suggest that a major effort is needed to educate the botanical community as well as lay persons on the implications and use of these pertinent articles in phylogenetic nomenclature.
10.2307/4135504|Typiflcation elements within the protologue of Actaea pachypoda Elliott are fully discussed. The absence of cited original material has led to our choice here of a suitable neotype in order to preserve current usage of the name.
10.2307/4135505|Seven names of taxa of the genus Eryngium L. (Eryngium amethystinum var. tenuifolium Boiss. & Heldr., Eryngium argyreum Maire, Eryngium atlanticum Batt. & Pit., Eryngium bourgatii var. atlanticum Ball, Eryngium carthamoides Sm., Eryngium marocanum Pit., Eryngium paniculatum Cav. & Dombey ex F. Delaroche) have been lectotypified in order to stabilize the names, and the holotype of E. falcatum Delaroche was detected. E. carthamoides Sm. in Rees was determined to be a synonym of E. aquifolium Cav. The lectotypification of E. paniculatum Cav. & Dombey ex F. Delaroche should contribute towards a resolution of the name's confusing nomenclature past.
10.2307/4135506|The names described by Linnaeus in the genus Callitriche are discussed and most are newly typified. Callitriche palustris L. is recognised, with C. verna L. as a heterotypic synonym, and the current usage of C. hermaphroditica L. is maintained.
10.2307/4135507| Hispano-Lusitanian plants traditionally identified as Scabiosa semipapposa Salzm. ex DC. are recognized with a new name, Scabiosa galianoi Devesa, Ortega-Olivencia & J. Lpez, after it was found that they differ clearly from the Moroccan plants on which De Candolle's description was based. 
10.2307/4135508|During the elaboration of a treatment of Rosaceae for the Flora of the Venezuelan Guayana, a new species of Prunus L. (P. lichoana Aymard), closely related to P. recurviflora Koehne, was discovered. A search for type material of P. recurviflora to assist in the interpretation of this new species was unsuccessful; therefore a neotype is designated for P. recurviflora, a species previously described from Colombia.
10.2307/4135509|Lectotypes, neotypes and epitypes are designated by seven specialists for 35 previously untypified Linnaean plant names (with one epitype being designated for a previously typified name) belonging to the family Cyperaceae. These newly proposed types support the current usage of the names concerned. Earlier but ineffective or supersedable type statements are discussed.
10.2307/4135510| Lectotypes for the names Alstroemeria burchelii Baker, A. caryophyllaea Jacq., A. chapadensis Hoehne, A. cunha Vell., A. rubra Morel, A. argentovittata Lem., and A. butantanensis Hoehne are designated here. The typification of A. nemorosa Gardner and A. piauhyensis Gardner is here clarified. An epitype is also chosen in order to avoid misinterpretation of the name A. burchellii Baker. For A. psittacina Lehm, and A. radula Dusn neotypes are designated. Alstroemeria speciosa M. C. Assis is published as an avowed substitute (replacement name) for Alstroemeria ins ignis Krnzl. 
10.2307/4135511| A neotype for the fossil conifer Pseudovoltzia liebeana (Geinitz) Florin is designated. It has been chosen from the material figured by Geinitz in 1880, which is stored at the Schsische Naturhistorische Sammlungen Dresden/Museum fr Mineralogie und Geologie. 
10.2307/4135512|In the first edition of Baron Dumont de Courset's "Le Botaniste Cultivateur", names were validly published for the Port Jackson Fig and the "Botany Bay oat" of the Sydney area, that of the fig at least antedating that in current use: it is proposed for rejection elsewhere in this issue (Mabberley & Dixon, 2004), though the identity of the "oat" is still unclear. By contrast, Tanacetum aucherianum (Compositae), apparently threatened by Chrysanthemum tanacetifolium Willd. (1803), is saved by the earlier but unlisted C. tanacetifolium (1802) of Dumont's book. The residue of other unlisted names in that work is disposed of, Dumont's use of Cels' binomials leading to a proposal elsewhere in this issue (Mabberley, 2004) to reject an earlier name for Fraxinus quadrangulata (Oleaceae) and consideration of a number of names in Ribes (Grossulariaceae). There remain unresolved issues in Anacampseros (Portulacaceae) and Bejaria (Ericaceae), while there are unplaced names in Cape Erica (Ericaceae), Gnidia (Thymelaeaceae), and Pelargonium (+Geraniaceae). Preliminary bibliographic findings on H. C. Andrews' Geraniums (1805 [-25]) are presented in an appendix.
10.2307/4135606|Molecular biology techniques have had a great impact in modern studies of biodiversity across the globe, and they have contributed significantly to our understanding of evolutionary relationships across all kingdoms. Protein and DNA sequence data have provided a seemingly endless amount of characters to be used in phylogenetic studies, and they have allowed comparisons across divergent groups for which it is very difficult to establish morphological homologies. Researchers in Latin America have not escaped this revolution, and in several institutions efforts have been made to begin utilizing them. Economical, social and political factors have both slowed and stimulated the development of molecular systematics and phylogenetics in Latin America. Even though the continent is not homogeneous, and these factors may differ from country to country, some general patterns do exist across the region. In the present document, we will attempt to summarize the status of molecular systematic studies throughout Latin America, analyze which factors have stimulated or slowed down its development, and we will conclude with some suggestions on how to improve the current state of affairs.
10.2307/4135607|The genus Trianaeopiper Trealese was described to have axillary inflorescences, a rare character within Piperaceae. Here we present phylogenetic evidence suggesting that Trianaeopiper is not monophyletic and should not be recognized as a distinct genus (new names and combinations are provided). The structure interpreted as an axillary inflorescence is a reduced axillary branch, a by-product of generalized reduction of shoots in these species. Reduction of plant size to a dwarf condition is a phenomenon observed in other angiosperms of the wet tropics. The dwarf habit is correlated with shady environments, suggesting that dwarfism may be an adaptation to the shady understory of wet tropical forests.
10.2307/4135608|Miconieae is the most diverse tribe of Melastomataceae, with 30 genera and over 2200 species. The tribe is characterized by fleshy fruits and partially to totally inferior ovaries. To test monophyly of the tribe and assess phylogenetic relationships within it, sequence data from nrITS were gathered and analyzed for 110 taxa in Miconieae and 32 putative outgroups. The tribe Miconieae is not resolved as monophyletic, but rather composed of two distinct clades: one composed of the cauliflorous genera Henriettea, Henriettella, Loreya and Bellucia, and a second clade with all other taxa in Miconieae, sister to a polytomy that includes representatives from tribes Merianieae and Blakeeae. Terminal inflorescences are optimized as basal within Miconieae, with lateral inflorescences evolving in at least four different instances. Cauliflory does not appear to be derived from truly axillary inflorescences; instead it seems to have evolved independently. The terminal-flowered genera Tococa, Conostegia, Tetrazygia, Anaectocalyx, Charianthus, Calycogonium, and Leandra pro parte seem to be derived from within the large genus Miconia, as is Clidemia, a genus with both axillary inflorescences and terminal inflorescences that are deflexed to a lateral position by an axillary branch. Maieta and Necranium, both with axillary inflorescences, are resolved as derived from within Clidemia.
10.2307/4135609|The genus Ceratozamia contains more than 20 species distributed in eastern and southern Mexico, with extensions into Central America. Morphology, anatomy, and molecular (ITS) data allow resolution of some aspects of species relationships, provide correlations with ecology, and suggest phytogeographic hypotheses. Some species complexes, such as those centered around C. norstogii and C. miqueliana, are restricted to southernwest Mexico, in what are regarded as Pleistocene floristic refugia. The low level of divergence of ITS sequences among taxa to the north of the Trans-Mexican Neovolcanic mountain range suggests a pattern of recent, and perhaps rapid, speciation.
10.2307/4135610|Knowledge of the evolution and biogeography of the Caribbean biota comes primarily from faunal studies, in spite of the tremendous richness of the Caribbean flora. The limited data to assess Caribbean phytogeography comes from fossils, floristic distributions, and phylogenetic studies. The geology in the Caribbean is extremely complex, but it is widely accepted that part of the Greater Antilles are old and precede the emergence of the Lesser Antilles and the Panamanian isthmus. Cuba and Hispaniola are each composed of a series of independent land blocks and Jamaica was mainly or entirely submerged during part of its history. Paleopalynological data, at present the only reliable source for reconstructing past plant communities, suggest warm-temperate to tropical conditions. Contemporary floristic data portray affinities with both Laurasian and Gondwanan derived plant groups. Shortcomings of traditional methodological approaches is a major criticism to studies assessing historical biogeography. Phylogenetics is an appropriate strategy to apply, because it: (1) elucidates the systematic relationships of taxa, (2) permits assessment of morphological and ecological evolution, and (3) illustrates the direction and sequence in which the distribution of a taxa originated. Study of Caribbean taxa with high levels of endemicity allows tracing the correspondence between taxa and geographic areas, and thus, permits application of a phylogeny for assessments of geographic relatedness under both dispersal and vicariant scenarios. Caribbean plant groups in several angiosperm families have now been studied phylogenetically. Some biogeographic patterns are starting to emerge from these studies, but more studies are needed for generalizations to be drawn.
10.2307/4135611| Phylogenetic relationships and genetic divergence among congeneric species endemic to the Juan Fernndez Islands and their relatives in continental Chile were estimated using percentage of divergence of ITS of nrDNA and genetic identity (Nei) based on allozyme variability. A total of 1151 individuals in 85 populations of 17 species was analyzed belonging to the genera Berberis (four spp.), Gunnera (four spp.), Myrceugenia (five spp.), and Sophora (four spp.). ITS regions 1 and 2 ranged between 442 and 504 bp long. The number of loci resolved differed within each genus and ranged between 5 and 11 (in Gunnera and Sophora, respectively). The new data allowed testing of previous hypotheses of relationship based on morphology and secondary products chemistry. Genetic identity values among insular congeneric species ranged between 0.936 (Gunnera) and 0.670 (Myrceugenia). ITS sequence divergence ranged from 0% (Gunnera and Sophora) to 4.2% (Myrceugenia). These values are within the ranges obtained for insular endemic species in other oceanic archipelagoes. Estimates of time of divergence of endemics from progenitors, based on isozyme data, lie between 188,500 and 2,580,000 years. The oldest island, Masatierra, is approximately 4 million years old and the youngest, Masafuera, 1-2 million years old. Genetic divergence between endemic species of Masafuera and their continental relatives is in general lower than that between endemic species of Masatierra and their putative continental ancestors. Genetic divergence is also greater between continental progenitors and derivative species in Masatierra than between endemic species pairs between Masatierra and Masafuera. 
10.2307/4135612|We undertook a phylogenetic analysis of sequences of the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of the nuclear ribosomal DNA to test the hypothesis that the Canary Island genus Vierea is closely related to Pulicaria sect. Vieraeopsis, a taxon with four species restricted to Socotra and Southern Arabia. The ITS tree does not support this relationship, although many of the nodes were weakly supported (bootstrap value below 75%). Vierea is sister to the Mediterranean genus Perralderia (bootstrap support 74%). We suggest that morphological similarities between Vierea and Pulicaria sect. Vieraeopsis are due mostly to morphological convergence. It is thus concluded that these two taxa do not share a common history. A review of molecular phylogenetic studies of taxa considered to represent putative biogeographical links between Macaronesia and Southern Arabia and/or distant regions of Africa, is also presented. With a few exceptions most of these putative relationships are not supported by molecular phylogenies. Additional cladistic studies are needed for at least 15 genera or sections with a predominant disjunct phytogeographical distribution between Macaronesia, East/South Africa and Southern Arabia.
10.2307/4135613|The genera of tribe Sipaneeae have been either included within tribe Rondeletieae or treated as its sister tribe, and historically placed in subfamily Cinchonoideae. The herbaceous habit was the only character used to separate Sipaneeae from Rondeletieae. Recent molecular phylogenies included Maguireothamnus, Sipanea, Sipaneopsis, and Neobertiera in Sipaneeae, and positioned the tribe in subfamily Ixoroideae. These results stimulated a detailed analysis of this tribe and an evaluation of the position and delimitation of several genera believed to be related because of their morphological similarity. Our study indicates that tribe Sipaneeae is monophyletic, and confirms its placement within Ixoroideae. The Sipaneeae clade included Chalepophyllum, Dendrosipanea, Limnosipanea, Maguireothamnus, Neobertiera, Sipanea, and Sipaneopsis. Several genera of this group are small shrubs, and the woody habit is shown to be basal in Sipaneeae. Sipanea and Limnosipanea are shown to be monophyletic and not sister taxa, indicating that the herbaceous habit evolved two times in the tribe. Sequences of Steyermarkia, Pteridocalyx and Neblinathamnus were not available in this study, but because of overall morphological similarity with the genera of Sipaneeae, they are tentatively included in the tribe.
10.2307/4135614|Anacardiaceae are largely tropical trees, shrubs and lianas of the order Sapindales, characterized by production of three types of toxic phenols: biflavonoids, alkylcatechols and alkylresorcinols. Anatomical, morphological and rbcL sequence data were used to reconstruct the phylogeny of a group of Anacardiaceae and address questions about the origin and evolution of these toxic phenolic compounds. Their evolutionary patterns are discussed in relation to the group of Hemipteran insects that feed on Anacardiaceae. Our study included 22 taxa of Anacardiaceae and the results support previous phylogenetic studies in that two clades are detected: a basal clade, with Spondias and related genera that do not produce toxic phenolic compounds, and a second clade with the remaining genera, i.e., those that produce biflavonoids, as do species of Burseraceae. The evolutionary patterns of alkylcatechols and alkylresorcinols are not straightforward; these substances are produced in unrelated groups of genera. We suggest, however, that Hemipteran insects do not feed on taxa of Anacardiaceae that produce alkylcatechols.
10.2307/4135615|The grass family (Poaceae) is the largest family of vascular plants in the Arctic. The family includes several species complexes that show high ploidy levels, predominantly reproduce asexually, are poorly morphologically delimited, and have a possible origin within the Arctic area by reticulate evolution. Challenged by work on the Panarctic Flora project and apparent discrepancies in recent taxonomic treatments, we investigated the arctic grass genus Dupontia by molecular and cytogenetic methods. Identical plastid DNA (trnL-F) sequences and very similar AFLP profiles indicated that Dupontia and Arctophila are closely related and that the latter might have been involved in a possible intergeneric hybrid origin of Dupontia. Despite the presence of intraindividual rDNA (ITS) variation in Dupontia indicating an allopolyploid hybrid origin of the genus, it was not possible to predict the second parental species from sequence data or from fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments using genomic probes. Due to lack of sequence divergence within Dupontia, AFLP fingerprinting was applied to investigate whether any genetic subdivision exists within the genus. The data sorted Dupontia first of all according to geography and not to ploidy or morphological characters that have previously been used to discriminate between proposed taxa. The results indicate that the recognition of a single polymorphic species is the best solution for the genus Dupontia.
10.2307/4135616|This study tested the monophyly of the previously proposed genera Alaternus, Frangula, Oreoherzogia, and Rhamnus s.str., and the phylogenetic relations suggested by Grubov (1949), within the Rhamnus s.l. clade. Based on a global sample of 22 species, we derived phylogenetic hypotheses using parsimony analysis of variation in trnL-F (chloroplast) and ITS (nuclear) DNA regions. Both Alaternus, Frangula, and Oreoherzogia gained strong support, and our results further support recognition of Frangula as a monophyletic genus. The resolution between Alaternus, Oreoherzogia, and the rest of Rhamnus s.str. was less clear, and the mainly Mediterranean Oreoherzogia was strongly grouped with the American R. crocea. Therefore, we consider it as unjustified to split the rest of Rhamnus into smaller genera. Regarding Grubov's phylogenetic hypothesis, our study could only support the dichotomy between Frangula and the rest of Rhamnus.
10.2307/4135617|Sequences of the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA were acquired for 112 species of Balsaminaceae worldwide and five species of its closest relatives Marcgraviaceae and Tetrameristaceae. Phylogenetic analyses applying parsimony and distance estimates confirmed the monophyly of Balsaminaceae and suggest the monophyly of Impatiens. Within Impatiens, a few clades are recognized with strong support. Two of the most important clades are the spurless Madagascan endemic group, and the one comprising species with broadly fusiform fruits and the basic chromosome number x = 8, that shows a Southeast Asia, southern India, Africa, and Madagascar connection. Despite recognition of several strongly supported small lineages, ITS data alone could not resolve relationships among most of the lineages with confident support values. ITS phylogenies are therefore of limited taxonomic value for Impatiens. However, ITS phylogenies do reveal that extant Impatiens species are of Southeast Asian origin, from where dispersals to boreal Eurasia and North America, to central Asia and eastern Europe via the Himalayas, and to India and Africa have occurred. The Madagascan Impatiens show an African origin. Molecular phylogenies suggest the ancestral basic chromosome number to be x = 10, and the spurred flowers and elongated linear fruits to be plesiomorphic states in Impatiens. A predominantly descending dysploid chromosome evolution, following dispersal of the clade with broadly fusiform fruits from Southeast Asia to India, Africa, and Madagascar, is also suggested.
10.2307/4135618|The position of the sterile western Mediterranean crustose-placodioid lichen generally known as Lecanora lisbonenesis has been investigated using mitochondrial SSU rDNA sequence data. It proves to belong to an independent genus of Physciaceae, for which the generic name Coscinocladium is available, and the earliest species name is Variolaria gaditana. Previous reports of apothecia in the species prove to be a result of mixtures with other lichen species. A lectotype is selected for L. lisbonensis, a neotype designated for V. gaditana, and the new combination Coscinocladium gaditanum made. The species is described, illustrated, its ecology discussed, and a distribution map provided.
10.2307/4135619|We conducted phylogenetic analyses of the fern family Grammitidaceae using sequences from two cpDNA genes and from morphological characters. Data were obtained for 73 species from most recognized genera in the family. The genera Adenophorus, Ceradenia, Calymmodon, Cochlidium, Enterosora, and Melpomene were each strongly supported as being monophyletic. Other recognized genera that were not supported as monophyletic included Ctenopteris, Grammitis, Lellingeria, Micropolypodium, Prosaptia, and Terpsichore. Several previously unrecognized clades were identified, some of which are characterized by distinctive morphological features. Analyses of the distribution of morphological character states on our inferred phylogeny showed extremely high levels of homoplastic evolution for many different characters. Homoplasy for morphological characters was considerably greater than for molecular characters. Many of the characters that exhibited high levels of convergent or parallel evolution across the phylogeny are features that have been commonly used to circumscribe genera in this group (e.g., leaf blade dissection, various rhizome scale characters, and glandular paraphyses). Conversely, some of the characters that exhibited relatively low levels of homoplasy have either not been regarded as having taxonomic value or have been ignored (e.g., root insertion, rhizome scale sheen). Our data support a New World origin of Grammitidaceae, with Old World taxa generally being more evolutionarily derived. Several clades are either primarily Neotropical or primarily Paleotropical but also have a few members distributed in the opposite hemisphere. Thus, we postulate multiple, independent dispersal and colonization events in several lineages.
10.2307/4135620|Based on the most recent evidence from phylogenetic analyses of Veronica and its related genera, we propose a new infratribal and infrageneric rearrangement for Veroniceae and Veronica. These recent analyses have settled the long dispute about the relationship of the Northern Hemisphere Veronica and the Southern Hemisphere Hebe complex and have shown the derivation of the latter from within the former. Other currently recognized genera such as Synthyris and Pseudolysimachion are also derived from within Veronica. A classification based on monophyletic genera therefore needs to either lump some well recognized genera into a large genus Veronica or split Veronica into several genera that seem impossible to separate using morphological or structural characters. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages and conclude that it is best to recognize a large genus Veronica (including Hebe, Parahebe, Chionohebe, Heliohebe, Detzneria, Derwentia, Pseudolysimachion, Synthyris and Besseyd) with 13 subgenera, along with 8 other genera, Scrofella, Veronicastrum (inclusive of Calorhabdos and Botryopleuron), Lagotis, Wulfenia, Kashmiria, Picrorhiza, Wulfeniopsis and Paederota, in Veroniceae.
10.2307/4135621| Results are presented of a study of 15 specimens on six herbarium sheets in the Queensland Herbarium, Indooroopilly, Australia (BRI) labelled as L. pedicularioides Brgesen v. queenslandica Cribb (Ceramiales, Rhodophyta), including the lectotype. All specimens, except the lectotype, belong to species of Chondrophycus or Laurencia either previously recorded or described from Australia, including C. succisus (Cribb) K. W. Nam, L. brongniartii J. Agardh, L. distichophylla J. Agardh, L. heteroclada Harvey and Z. majuscula (Harvey) Lucas. Only the lectotype, a sterile specimen collected at Redcliffe (Queensland, Australia), exhibits those vegetative features consistent with L. pedicularioides v. queenslandica. From comparisons with the holotype of L. pedicularioides Brgesen, a tetrasporic specimen collected at Dwarka (India) housed in the herbarium of Copenhagen (C), it is confirmed that Cribb's variety belongs in Brgesen's species. Moreover, due to the epidermal origin of tetrasporangia observed in the holotype, this species is transferred to Osmundea as O. pedicularioides (Brgesen) comb. nov. This first record from both the Indian and the SW-Pacific Oceans of a species of Osmundea, suggests that the genus might reflect a Tethyan (and not a late Tethyan) distribution pattern. 
10.2307/4135622|The systematic position of Parashorea chinensis (Dipterocarpaceae) was investigated by using maximum parsimony analysis of nucleotide sequences of matK, trnL intron, and trnL-trnF intergenic spacer region of chloroplast DNA. Previous studies have placed the taxon in Parashorea or Shorea. Analyses indicate that P. chinensis belongs within Parashorea (80% bootstrap) rather than within Shorea. Furthermore, P. chinensis Wang Hsie and P. chinensis Wang Hsie var. kwangsiensis Lin Chi are further confirmed to be the same taxon.
10.2307/4135623|Bioregional planning processes, which employ an essentially holistic view of the environment as far as current and proposed land-use practices are concerned, are justifiably gaining ground worldwide. This is also true for South Africa, a country that harbours remarkably rich biota. The concept of bioregional planning prominently includes aspects such as informed conservation planning and the sustainable use of biodiversity, among a range of other equally important environmental considerations. This paper argues that support of on-going, basic taxonomic studies in bioregions are critically important to ensure the comprehensive and accurate documentation and inventorying of biodiversity at any scale. As such, taxonomists fulfill an essential role in the initial and follow-up phases of bioregional planning processes. Insufficient attention to checklisting activities will severely hamper the implementation of workable bioregional plans.
10.2307/4135624| Despite advances in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote-sensing technology and software, to date most systematists and other botanists working on the Neotropical flora, particularly on the monographic series Flora Neotropica, have used hard-copy maps. These maps make it possible to see basic distribution patterns, but they are highly inaccurate, and the fact that the data are not compiled in digital form means that it is difficult or impossible to retrieve the metadata (i.e., the collection data and attributes of the specimen(s) associated with each point on the map), select and combine distribution datasets for various organisms, perform spatial statistics on the distributions, or overlay species distributions onto maps of soils, climate, and other environmental variables. In an effort to help modernize Neotropical plant studies and make GIS more accessible to botanists, we have developed a digital base map of the Americas with multiple registered map layers that can be superimposed in any combination and can be used to easily create digital distribution maps from collection lists for dissemination and analysis. This base map, freely available to botanists and systematists, was made using ArcView GIS. Several of the layers were derived from Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) datasets (ArcWorld, ArcAtlas, Digital Chart of the World). For a basic version of this system we obtained additional datasets on vegetation and soils (Woods Hole Research Center), elevation (U.S. Geological Survey), and EcoRegions (World Wildlife Fund); for our own projects, we have added layers from a number of additional sources and more appropriate in scale for Amazonia and the state of Acre, Brazil. The layers are being expanded upon as new datasets become available, and we are actively seeking additional sets from other sources, including geographical institutes in individual Neotropical countries. This system makes it possible to carry out a number of rather elegant analyses and visualizations, including the following: (1) plot the distributions of species and use the overlays to easily visualize coincidence of distribution patterns with geographic and environmental features; (2) map values for morphological characters onto the distribution points in order to examine character variation over the range of the species (e.g., plotting leaf size to see latitudinal or longitudinal patterns); (3) quantitatively analyze spatial statistics (e.g., examining the relationship between fruit size and rainfall); and (4) vastly increase the agility and versatility of historical biogeography techniques. Though any botanist adept at using GIS theoretically could conduct these analyses, the Americas Base Map assembles a disparate set of high-quality, botanically relevant environmental and geographic data in one place and provides instructions that obviate the need for deep expertise in GIS. This dramatically improves access to relevant geospatial data for botanists, especially in the developing world, and should serve to expand the use of GIS in plant biogeography. We anticipate that this multifaceted approach to mapping species distributions will facilitate the work of systematists and floristicians, and that it will help Neotropical plant geography to progress from conjecture to testable hypotheses. The Americas Base Map may be utilized by any botanist affiliated with a non-profit institution and with access to ArcView, and it is available on CD by request. 
10.2307/4135629| On their famous expedition to tropical America (1799-1804) Humboldt and Bonpland recorded plant descriptions, preliminary determinations, localities and habitat information in seven collecting books, which are kept today in the Musum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris. The entries were numbered in a single chronological sequence from 1 to 4528 and the numbers cited on the field labels. Together with the herbarium specimens and the field drawings this material later formed the basis for the botanical parts of the voluminous Voyage aux Rgions quinoxiales du Nouveau Continent. Bonpland, Willdenow and notably Kunth, while working on the specimens in Paris, added determinations to the collecting books, which permit a very precise analysis of the expedition and the later publication process. 
10.2307/4135630| In 1929, Edvard August Vainio authored 66 new names of lichens and six new names of non-lichenized ascomycetes from Mozambique based on material collected by the Portuguese scientist Amrico Pires de Lima and deposited in three herbaria: Porto (PO), the Vainio collection in Turku (TUR-V), and Helsinki (H). A list of the original material studied by Vainio, with indications of the types, is presented here. 
10.2307/4135631| It is shown that the name Chiliospora A. Massai, with its one species, C. elegans Zw. ex A. Massai., was made public before Biatoridium Krb, and its type B. monasteriensis Lahm ex Krb. However, this was done in a meeting at the Academy in Venice in February 1860, where a printed version of the lecture was handed out, but not, apparently, distributed to even the limited extent required for effective publication according to the ICBN. That happened only at the end of the year 1860, and in the meantime Krber had published his name in a valid and effective manner, his name being fortunately the earlier, and no nomenclatural changes are 3 necessary. 
10.2307/4135632|The four names in use for Plasmopara parasitic on Geranium are lectotypified. It is recommended that the name Plasmopara pusilla should be restricted to Plasmopara occurring mostly on Geranium pratense. Plasmopara geranii-pratensis is considered a taxonomic synonym of P. pusilla. Plasmopara geranii-sylvatici, frequently treated as a synonym of Plasmopara pusilla, is reinstated. Plasmopara geranii, based on two fungi, is retained for the common downy mildew of Geranium spp. in North America.
10.2307/4135633|Qiongzhuea and its species have received considerable attention concerning the validity of publication of names in different publications. However, it has apparently not been appreciated that both Qiongzhuea and a further bamboo genus, Dendrocalamopsis, were validly published by descriptio generico-specifico. Consequently they were validly published at an earlier date, with different types, than has been generally understood. The correct place of publication, authorship and typification is given and discussed for both genera, and a new section name, Chimonobambusa sect. Neoqiongzhuea, is published for those species of that genus with greatly swollen nodes.
10.2307/4135634|The typification and tortuous nomenclature of three Tasmanian conifers is discussed. They are currently known as Microcachrys tetragona (Hook.) Hook. f., Microstrobos niphophilus J. Garden & L.A.S. Johnson (both Podocarpaceae) and Diselma archeri Hook. f. (Cupressaceae). The similarities between these plants, all of which are dioecious, microphyllous shrubs with minute cones and which often grow together, have resulted in their original descriptions being confused and each based on two or more elements belonging to different taxa. A chronological account of the chaotic and confusing literature relevant to this problem is presented together with a revised nomenclature. Much confusion in recent literature has been caused by authors misinterpreting what J.D. Hooker was referring to when he used the pronoun 'it' in a commentary in 1857. The most serious conclusion is that Pherosphaera hookeriana W. Archer bis is the correct name for ''Microstrobos niphophilus J. Garden & L.A.S. Johnson", a binary designation that has been in use for 50 years but which is shown still not to be a validly published name. As a consequence of this, the other (Australian) species of Microstrobos, M. fitzgeraldii (F. Muell.) J. Garden & L.A.S. Johnson, must also be transferred back to Pherosphaera. Lectotypes are designated for Microcachrys tetragona and Pherosphaera hookeriana;, an earlier lectotypification of the latter name is here rejected since the specimen chosen was not part of the original material. Possibilities of conserving names involved are discussed.
10.2307/4135635|The typification of the names of three Linnean species which occur in Calabria (S. Italy) is discussed. An illustration in a pre-Linnaean work of Dillenius is designated as the lectotype of Aizoon hispanicum L. (Aizoaceae); a specimen from the Clifford Herbarium (BM) is designated lectotype for Staphylea pinnata L. (Staphyleaceae), and one from the Linnaean Herbarium (LINN) is designated for Plantago albicans L. (Plantaginaceae).
10.2307/4135636|The typification of the names of four species originally described by Desfontaines and reported in the literature for Calabria (S Italy) is discussed. Lectotypes from the Desfontaines Herbarium (P) are designated for Aristida adscensionis subsp. coerulescens (Desf.) Bourreil & Trouin ex Auquier & J. Duvign. (= A. coerulescens Desf., Poaceae), Helianthemum sessiliflorum (Desf.) Pers. (= Cistus sessiltflorus Desf., Cistaceae), Ranunculus spicatus Desf. (Ranunculaceae), and Salsola oppositifolia Desf. (Chenopodiaceae).
10.2307/4135637|The correct name Comptonia difformis (Sternb.) Berry is discussed against its later homonym Comptonia acutiloba Brongn. 1828. The name Comptonia difformis is based on the first legitimately published name Aspleniopteris difformis Sternb. 1825. This name is treated as nomen novum and not as a new combination based on an illegitimate name Asplenium difforme Sternb. 1821.
10.2307/4135638|Lectotypes for the names Hypolytrum amplum Poepp. & Kunth, H laxum Kunth, H. macrophyllum Boeck., H selloianum Boeck., H. strictum Poepp. & Kunth, H. sylvaticum Poepp. & Kunth, and Scirpus pulcher Rudge are designated.
10.2307/4135639|A new generic name Paravojnovskya Doweld is established for Carboniferous/Permian umbellate strobili of Angaraland pteridospermous plants replacing the illegitimate Gaussia M. F. Neuburg, 1934, which is a later homonym of Gaussia H. A. Wendland, 1865, used for recent palms. Three new combinations are made to transfer all described species of Gaussia to Paravojnovskya: P. cristata (M. F. Neuburg) Doweld, P. scutellata (M. F. Neuburg) Doweld and P. imbricata (Naugolnykh) Doweld.
10.2307/4135440|Compositae (Asteraceae) are the largest flowering plant family (23,000 to 30,000 species) and its members are found throughout the world in both temperate and tropical habitats. The subfamilies and tribes of Compositae remained relatively constant for many years; recent molecular studies, however, have identified new subfamilial groups and identified previously unknown relationships. Currently there are 35 tribes and 10 subfamilies (Baldwin & al., 2002; Panero & Funk, 2002). Some of the tribes and subfamilies have not been tested for monophyly and without a clear understanding of the major genera that form each tribe and subfamily, an accurate phylogeny for the family cannot be reconstructed. The tribe Arctoteae (African daisies) is a diverse and interesting group with a primarily southern African distribution (ca. 17 genera, 220 species). They are especially important in that most of the species are found in the Cape Floral Kingdom, the smallest floral kingdom and the subject of intense conservation interest. Arctoteae are part of the monophyletic subfamily Cichorioideae s.s. Other tribes in the subfamily include Eremothamneae, Gundelieae, Lactuceae, Liabeae, Moquineae, and Vernonieae, and these were all evaluated as potential outgroups. Ultimately 29 ingroup taxa and 16 outgroup taxa with a total of 130 sequences (125 newly reported), from three genetic regions, two from chloroplast DNA (trnL-F and ndhF) and one from the nuclear genome (ITS), were used to evaluate the tribe and its proposed outgroups. Each molecular region is examined separately, the chloroplast markers are examined together, and the data are combined. The data were analyzed with and without outgroups and problem taxa using parsimony and maximum likelihood methods. The analyses showed robust support for two outgroup clades, Liabeae-Vernonieae and Gundelieae-Lactuceae and two main subtribes within Arctoteae: Arctotineae and Gorteriinae. Support for monophyly of Arctoteae is weak. Within Arctoteae, some taxa of interest are easily placed: Didelta, Cuspidia and Heterorhachis are consistently part of subtribe Gorteriinae, Cymbonotus, the Australian genus, is nested within subtribe Arctotineae, and Haplocarpha is at the base of Arctotineae. Berkheya, Haplocarpha, and Hirpicium are probably paraphyletic. Furthermore, Platycarpha most likely does not belong in Arctoteae, and Heterolepis and the tribe Eremothamneae are within Arctoteae but not within either of the two main subtribes. After some rearrangements, the two main subtribes, Arctotineae and Gorteriinae, are monophyletic and the latter has three clades. The study shows that the unusual taxa are of critical importance, and they should be included in any molecular analysis. Adequate representation of the ingroup is also important as all previous studies of Arctoteae had involved only a few taxa from the core subtribes, and so did not reveal the problems. Multiple outgroups evaluated in an iterative manner had pronounced effects on the relationships within the ingroup, not only on the position of the root. Finally, unrooted consensus trees and unrooted phylograms were found to be very useful in analyzing the data, allowing for examination of placement of taxa without the bias of a rooted tree.
10.2307/4135441|The N Hemisphere genus Achillea includes about 130 perennial and allogamous species, is centered in SE Europe/SW Asia, and exhibits a complex phyletic structure due to excessive hybridization and polyploidy. About half of the species and five of the six traditional sections together with several outgroup genera were studied using nrlTS and plastid trnL-F DNA sequences. In spite of some discordance, these markers were shown by Maximum Parsimony and Bayesian Inference to be suitable for revealing relationships with generic allies and for distinguishing the main lineages within Achillea. With the inclusion of Otanthus (and possibly Leucocyclus) Achillea s.l. becomes monophyletic and appears as sister to Anacyclus. A basal clade is formed by the xerophytes of Achillea sections Babounya and Santolinoideae in SW Asia together with the Mediterranean coastal Otanthus. Achillea sect. Ptarmica s.l. has to be divided into the meso- to hygrophytic herbs of A. sect. Ptarmica s.s. in the N Hemisphere and the mountain species of A. sect. Anthemoideae. The latter differentiated in the mountains from NW Anatolia to the Pyrenees, possibly originating from ancestors related to the extant A. ligustica. Finally, taxa of sect. Achillea s.l. (to be merged with A. sect. Filipendulinae) radiated from a center in SE Europe, occupied very different open habitats, and reached an extensive distribution with the very polymorphic polyploid and reticulate complex A. millefolium agg. Here and in other groups of Achillea, various instances of conflicting evidence from nrITS, plastid trnL-F, and morphology point to hybridization and lineage sorting. This means that reticulate evolution is not only involved in recent radiations but must have been active already in the early diversification of the genus.
10.2307/4135442|Guynesomia (Asteraceae: Astereae), a new genus restricted to the western slopes of the Andes mountains in central Chile, is described. Guynesomia is a shrub characterised by raceme-like or panicle-like capitulescences, disciform capitula, alveolate receptacles, pistillate zygomorphic marginal florets with three or four short lobes, and a pappus of two series of subequal scabrid bristles. Diplostephium is the putative closest relative of Guynesomia. The new combination Guynesomia scoparia is based on Nardophyllum scoparium.
10.2307/4135443|The phylogenetic relationships of the genus Saussurea DC. and Hemistepta lyrata Bunge were analyzed using the nuclear ribosomal ITS and chloroplast matK gene. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that Saussurea ceratocarpa Decne. of subg. Jurinocera (Baill.) Lipsch. and the species assigned to sect. Elatae Hook.f. of subg. Saussurea were separated from all other members of the genus Saussurea. The species of subgen. Jurinocera and subgen. Saussurea sect. Elatae form a monophyletic unit along with a group including genus Jurinea Cass. The species of subg. Jurinocera and sect. Elatae share 4-5-gonal cypselas and apical pericarpal crowns bearing sharp horns or sharp teeth. The Saussurea s.s. group is comprised of representatives of six sections of the subg. Saussurea and morphologically distinctive subgenera [Amphilaena (Stschegl.) Lipsch., Eriocoryne (DC.) Hook.f, and Theodorea (Cass.) Lipsch.]. Two frigid-adapted forms, the "snowball plants" of subg. Eriocoryne and the "glasshouse plants" of subg. Amphilaena, were confirmed as members of Saussurea s.s. Hemistepta lyrata and Saussurea s.s. show a close sister relationship, which is supported by the pappus dimorphism involving free, short, scabrid outer bristles or tiny outer scales and basally connate in a ring, with much longer, plumose inner bristles.
10.2307/4135444|As currently delimited, Solidagininae are a large (approximately 190 species) subtribe of tribe Astereae. Recent molecular and morphological studies have prompted a new definition of the subtribe, but the lack of absolute morphological synapomorphies raises the possibility that this assemblage may not be monophyletic. Cladistic and likelihood-based analyses were conducted on a nuclear rDNA ITS sequence dataset derived from 23 of the 24 genera included in recent Solidagininae circumscriptions. Cladistic analyses identified two clades entirely composed of proposed Solidagininae genera. The data were not able to support deeper relationships, and these two clades might or might not form one monophyletic lineage. Topology testing indicated compatibility between the taxonomic definition of Solidagininae and molecular data.
10.2307/4135445|Subtribe Scorzonerinae of tribe Lactuceae (Asteraceae: Cichorioideae) appears to be well supported as monophyletic; however, generic circumscription and relationships within the group have been problematic. To investigate the monophyly and circumscription of the recognized genera and their intergeneric relationships, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of subtribe Scorzonerinae using ITS sequence data. Our results reveal that most genera, including Tragopogon, Epilasia, Podospermum, Koelpinia, and Lasiospora, are monophyletic. The monotypic Pterachaenia and Tourneuxia are distinct lineages within Scorzonerinae. The monotypic Geropogon, which has often been included in Tragopogon, is phylogenetically removed from the highly supported Tragopogon clade. In contrast, Scorzonera is clearly not monophyletic, with species of the genus appearing in multiple clades with other genera. Scorzonera purpurea is weakly supported as the sister to Podospermum. Scorzonera austriaca is sister to Takhtajaniantha and may represent one ancestral parent of this monotypic polyploid genus. Species of Scorzonera sections Tuberosae, Vierhapperia, Nervosae, and Pulvinares form a clade with the genus Lasiospora. Scorzonera sections Pulvinares, Tuberosae, and Foliosae are clearly not monophyletic. Some non-DNA characters (e.g., achene morphology) generally agree with the clades recognized by ITS sequence data. However, our analyses also show that traditionally important morphological and karyological characters have multiple origins in Scorzonerinae.
10.2307/4135446|Twenty-four gametophytic characters were evaluated to identify the phylogenetic relationships among the known species of Aloinella. A previous study proposed that Aloinella derived from Aloina, mainly by stem elongation and leaf character reduction. In this analysis, it was observed that the most plesiomorphic species in the Aloina and Aloinella clades occur in Mexico. The distribution and the cladistic study support the view that both genera are monophyletic, but the phylogenetic relationships of the species may need further analysis with the inclusion of sporophytic characters. Sporophytes are infrequent in Aloinella. The smooth-walled A. cucullatifolia, A. boliviana, and A. cucullifera form a group that separates cladistically from the papillose taxa A. catenula, A. venezuelana, A. galeata var. galeata, and A. galeata var. andina.
10.2307/4135447|This paper provides a practical taxonomic treatment of the polyphyletic genus Centaurium Hill. This new classification defines monophyletic groups and thus reflects the phylogenetic relationships within the subtribe Chironiinae (Gentianaceae). For this purpose, the establishment of a new genus, Zeltnera, along with the reinstatement of Gyrandra Griseb. and Schenkia Griseb., results in numerous new species combinations, a more restrictive circumscription of Centaurium Hill, and novel generic delimitations within Chironiinae. Fifteen genera are recognized, encompassing ca. 108 species. The new genus Zeltnera comprises 25 species mainly confined to California, Mexico, and Texas. Gyrandra is a small genus with three species restricted to some areas of Mexico (G. chironioides, G. pterocaulis and G. tenuifolia) and two species widespread in Central America (G. brachycalyx and G. pauciflora). Schenkia comprises five species: S. spicata is broadly distributed in Eurasia and north Africa, S. australis, S. clementii, and S. japonica are confined to Australia and the Pacific region, while S. sebaeoides is a rare and endangered Hawaiian endemic. Finally, the genus Centaurium s.s. consists of ca. 20 species of primarily Mediterranean distribution.
10.2307/4135448|Following a revision of Soldanella, we here synonymize 109 non-hybrid names of this genus. We also lectotypify or neotypify 17 names of Soldanella. These are S. alpina L., S. alpina F. W. Schmidt, S. alpina L. var. carestiae Cristofolini et Pignatti, S. alpina L. f. major Cristofolini et Pignatti, S. austriaca Vierh., S. carpatica Vierh., S. marmarossiensis Kldst., S. minima Hoppe, S. minima Hoppe subsp. samnitica Cristofolini et Pignatti, S. minima Hoppe f. latifolia Cristofolini et Pignatti, S. montana Mikan, S. montana Willd., S. montana Willd. subsp. faceta Kress, S. occidentalis Vierh., S. pusilla Baumg., S. pusilla Baumg. f. calcicola Vierh., and S. pusilla Baumg. var. chrysosplenifolia J. Murr.
10.2307/4135449|"Big" plant genera, those of 500 or more species, have not only occasioned interest among systematic botanists, but for geographical, ecological or horticultural reasons, have also become well-established popular concepts. Their size has rendered them difficult, if not impossible, to study in their entirety; there have been few full revisions since the nineteenth century. Despite their embodiment of significant taxonomic, biological and evolutionary questions, from the 1980s their importance has been more generally recognised, and recent technological and methodological developments have made it easier to come to grips with their study. This paper synthesizes growth impediments to our knowledge of these genera and possible approaches to studying them. Of the 57 genera currently thought to have 500 or more species, 22 of these were also considered in 1883 to be large (300 or more species). Others gained their prominence as a result of later exploration, some of it driven by enthusiasts. It is argued that comparisons of size, phenomena, and processes will only be possible by comprehensive study of the lineages comprising these genera and their immediate historical relatives; uncritical lists or relatively limited samples are not enough. Such studies will be of great scientific as well as cultural benefit.
10.2307/4135450|Although the majority of systematic palynologists use Erdtman's acetolysis method or the slightly modified method of Reitsma for the preparation of pollen grains for LM and SEM observations, these methods have some major drawbacks. Especially within monocots, pollen grains are often thin-walled, and therefore tend to collapse even after a mild acetolysis, as experienced, for instance, in Cyperaceae and Dioscoreaceae, among other groups. Very satisfying results often are obtained by the use of fresh material. Unfortunately, this is not available in most cases, especially when working on tropical taxa-hence making herbarium material indispensable. We present a comparison between three major methods for the treatment of fragile pollen (KOH/CPD-treatment, glutaraldehyde/CPD-treatment, and a mild acetolysis) and introduce a new enzyme-based method using cellulase and pectinase. All four methods are tested on three different monocotyledons of three different orders: Allium ursinum L. (Liliales), Asparagus officinalis L. (Asparagales), and Tamus communis L. (Dioscoreales). The properties and results of each method are then critically assessed. The new method yields satisfying results especially on the hydration state and shape of the pollen grains.
10.2307/4135451|Mercuric chloride has been used for control of insect and fungal infestations in herbarium collections for over two centuries. One of the lasting effects of this use is the long-term evolution of elemental mercury vapor from treated specimens. The vapor can contaminate untreated specimens sharing the same closed environment and can pose a human health hazard. By modifying the technique for use of a commercially available mercury indicating powder (Mallinckrodt Baker, Inc., J. T. Baker Mercury Indicator) it is possible to create an inexpensive and fairly rapid test for mercury vapor in herbarium cabinets. The indicator is mixed with deionized water and applied to glass microscope slides. One or more slides are placed inside a cabinet and any color change in the indicator is compared to unexposed controls. In the authors' experiments, the indicator results were compared against readings taken using a Jerome 431-X Mercury Vapor Analyzer and a Lumex RA-915+ Multifunctional Mercury Analyzer and were found to be broadly related to the concentration of mercury vapor present in each cabinet. The method can be used to check for mercury contamination in incoming shipments of specimens and to identify cabinets that currently contain or formerly contained contaminated specimens. Practical safety guidelines have been developed for accessing cabinets that give a positive test for the vapor and for handling contaminated specimens.
10.2307/4135452|Cladograms are classification schemes that test for monophyly. Recent discussions have argued that cladograms ignore species histories or genealogies in the classification of taxonomic groups. The conclusion drawn from these discussions is that are two "ways of seeing" classification - synchrony and diachrony.
10.2307/4135454|Lectotypes, neotypes and epitypes are designated by 14 specialists for 42 previously untypified Linnaean plant names belonging to the family Boraginaceae. These newly proposed types support the current usage of the names concerned. Earlier but ineffective or supersedable type statements are discussed.
10.2307/4135455|The name Oxytropis xinglongshanica C. W. Chang was not validly published in 1987 because two types were indicated. The name is validated here.
10.2307/4135456|A lectotype is designated for the name Lopholejeunea utriculata Steph. This selection preserves current usage of the name, but two other original specimens of Lopholejeunea utriculata are assigned to L. lepidoscypha.
10.2307/4135457| Even though it has been generally accepted that the generic name Felipponea Broth. (Bryophyta, Leucodontaceae) was validly published in 1912, this appears not to be the case, due to the lack of a generic description. The subsequent description of this genus in 1925 by Brotherus in the second edition of the Musci in Die Natrlichen Pflanzenfamilien created a superfluous name because in the meanwhile the genus Pterogoniadelphus M. Fleisch. was established in 1917 to accommodate the same species, Cladomnion montevidense Mll. Hal., and this generic name has priority. Three new combinations, P. assimilis (Mll. Hal.) Ochyra & Zijlstra, P. esquirolii (Thr.) Ochyra & Zijlstra and P. hollermayeri (Thr.) Ochyra & Zijlstra, are proposed. 
10.2307/4135558|Species delineation in Euphrasia has long been a challenge for taxonomists. In this paper, DNA sequences are used to evaluate the morphological taxa of Taiwanese Euphrasia as well as to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship among them. ITS sequences of 147 samples of Euphrasia, one Aeginetia, and one Pedicularis from Taiwan along with nine samples of Euphrasia from abroad were studied. Six non-native species of Section Euphrasia were used as outgroups and 14 haplotypes from four taxa of Taiwanese Euphrasia, E. tarokoana Ohwi, E. nankotaizanensis Yamam., E. transmorrisonensis Hayata, and E. transmorrisonensis var. durietziana (Ohwi) T. C. Huang & M. J. Wu, served as the ingroup to reconstruct a phylogenetic tree according to the criterion of maximum parsimony. Based on the phylogenetic tree, three monophyletic haplotype lineages of the ingroup were obtained, closely correlating with geographical distributions (with some overlap in adjacent regions). However, plants of different taxa are found in the same lineage. Lineage I includes all four Taiwanese taxa, whereas lineage II includes two taxa, E. transmorrisonensis, and E. transmorrisonensis var. durietziana. Lineage III includes three taxa: E. nankotaizanensis, E. transmorrisonensis, and E. transmorrisonensis var. durietziana. Different taxa share a common haplotype. Euphrasia nankotaizanensis, E. transmorrisonensis, and E. transmorrisonensis var. durietziana share haplotype E; E. nankotaizanensis and E. transmorrisonensis share haplotype D; and E. transmorrisonensis and E. transmorrisonensis var. durietziana share haplotypes G and N. The shared haplotypes may reflect retained ancestral polymorphisms at a neutral locus (ITS) through a series of recent speciation events (lineage sorting). The nucleotide additivities are found frequently among taxa. For example, the A+B additivity pattern of E. tarokoana and E. transmorrisonensis var. durietziana could reflect hybridization. Nucleotide additivity also provided insight into reticulate relationships among populations within and between taxa. Lineage sorting and hybridization might be mechanisms driving speciation in Taiwanese Euphrasia, resulting in retention of morphology and adaptation to distinct habitats. According to ITS evidence, we reconfirm four taxa of Euphrasia in Taiwan.
10.2307/4135559|The systematic position of Argentinean Cortesia cuneifolia (Ehretiaceae, Boraginales) is investigated based both on morphological and on ITS1 sequence data. Inferred from a molecular phylogeny, monotypic Cortesia is not isolated from other taxa of Ehretiaceae as previously suggested, but is nested within Ehretia. Cortesia shares a two-parted endocarp with the Ehretia II subclade (including Ehretia microphylla), which is considered as a derived condition within Ehretiaceae and is the most striking indication for a close relationship of the two. ITS1 sequence data and specialised leaf morphology suggest that Ehretia microphylla is probably the sister species of Cortesia cuneifolia, for which a new name is proposed: Ehretia cortesia.
10.2307/4135560| Molecular phylogenies based on the ITS-LSU nrDNA and part of the -tubulin region were used to investigate the position of Neuropogon in Usnea s. lat. Bayesian inference and maximum parsimony strongly supported the monophyly of Neuropogon. Subgenus Usnea and Neuropogon form a strongly supported group with subg. Eumitria and subg. Dolichousnea as consecutive monophyletic sister groups. The following generic classification is proposed: Usnea (subgenus Usnea only), Neuropogon, Eumitria, and Dolichousnea. Dolichousnea is elevated to generic rank. Usnea as presently conceived is clearly non-monophyletic but with the present recircums cription it may be monophyletic, or not; this requires further analysis. The genera are well characterised morphologically, and pending further investigations this classification is in agreement with current practice and minimises the need for nomenclatural changes. The following new combinations are made: Dolichousnea (Y. Ohmura) Articus, Dolichousnea longissima (Ach.) Articus, D. trichodeoides (Vain.) Articus, D. diffracta (Vain.) Articus, and Eumitria pectinata (Taylor) Articus. 
10.2307/4135561|Microtrichomanes, a controversial genus created originally to accommodate "intermediates" between Hymenophyllum and Trichomanes, was reassessed using molecular data in order to clarify the systematic position of the species assigned to it. The results strongly suggest a polyphyletic origin for Microtrichomanes, with most of the species being placed in Hymenophyllum s.l., in spite of their having the cup-shaped involucre which is the primary taxonomic character of Trichomanes s.l. Based on this result, some new combinations are made herein for the species formerly attributed to Microtrichomanes; and an updated dichotomous key and synonymic lists are provided.
10.2307/4135562|Two new species of Heloniopsis (Melanthiaceae) endemic to Korea are described: H tubiflora and H. koreana. Heloniopsis tubiflora is similar to H. orientalis, but the former has flowers at anthesis arranged obliquely downward (to pendulous) and has a basally tubular perianth, usually recurved apically (rarely straight) and bluish-purple to purple (but usually whitish near the apex when mature). Heloniopsis koreana differs from H. orientalis in having leaves that are usually spathulate, rarely oblanceolate, with minutely undulate margin, and with tepals slightly saccate to non-saccate at the base. Through comparison of herbarium specimens, we conclude that all plants in Korea comprise these two new endemic species. Based on the molecular phylogeny resulting from combined analyses of trnK 5' intron and matK DNA sequence data, Heloniopsis comprises three lineages: (1) five species in Japan and Taiwan; (2) H koreana; and (3) H. tubiflora.
10.2307/4135563|Generic concepts in the parmelioid lichens have been discussed intensively over the past three decades without reaching a broad consensus. We have now employed molecular data from three genes to provide a basis for a revised generic concept of the parmelioid lichens containing Xanthoparmelia-type lichenan. The phylogeny of the parmelioid lichens containing Xanthoparmelia-type lichenan was reconstructed using a combined Bayesian analysis of nuclear ITS, LSU rDNA and mitochondrial SSU rDNA sequences, and a maximum parsimony analysis was also made for comparison. 179 new partial sequences of 58 taxa were generated and 12 sequences were downloaded from GenBank. Our results indicate that the lichens containing Xanthoparmelia-type lichenan form a monophyletic group. However, the segregates proposed earlier do not form distinct clades within the group. Alternative hypotheses of monophyletic Karoowia and Neofuscelia that are not nested within Xanthoparmelia were rejected with our dataset; Karoowia is polyphyletic, and Neofuscelia is reduced to synonymy under Xanthoparmelia. Xanthomaculina convoluta also belongs to Xanthoparmelia. Since we were unable to sequence the umbilicate type species of Xanthomaculina, we refrain from synonymizing that genus with Xanthoparmelia here. The synonymy of Chondropsis and Paraparmelia under Xanthoparmelia already proposed is supported. The revised and enlarged genus Xanthoparmelia includes species that have cell walls with Xanthoparmelia-type lichenan, a palisade plectenchyma with a pored epicortex, lack pseudocyphellae, with usually simple rhizines, generally bifusiform conidia, and medullary chemical diversity. Ten new names are proposed, and 129 new combinations are made into Xanthoparmelia.
10.2307/4135564|In the most recent morphology-based taxonomic classification of African Oxalis L., 206 species were recognized in nine indigenous southern African sections. A subsequent palynological review of these taxa conflicted with their taxonomic classification. In the present study, phylogenetic relationships within section Angustatae subsection Lineares are re-assessed, using plastid trnL-F non-coding DNA sequence data. The results of this study clearly indicate that, based on the DNA evidence, subsection Lineares is non-monophyletic. Previously hypothesized relationships within the subsection are also refuted. In contrast, molecular and palynological data are highly congruent, and both differ substantially from the current morphological classification for subsection Lineares.
10.2307/4135565|Chromosome numbers of 45 accessions representing 16 genera and 37 species of Araliaceae are herein reported, of which 30 species and seven genera (Apiopetalum, Arthrophyllum, Delarbrea, Merrilliopanax, Metapanax, Myodocarpus, and Pseudosciadium) are recorded for the first time. The evolution of this character is also examined in light of recent hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships. Chromosome numbers in the family are relatively uniform, generally with 2n = 24 or 48. However, the genus Hedera exhibits extreme variability, with a polyploid series ranging from 2n = 48 to 192. The basic number of Araliaceae is inferred to be x = 12, although x = 6 cannot be ruled out. The "Asian palmate" clade, the largest of the three major clades of core Araliaceae, is primarily characterized by polyploidy, although several genera have sometimes been regarded as evolutionarily "primitive". By contrast, Aralia, Panax, and Polyscias (representing other major clades within the family) include species with both diploids and tetraploids. Four genera recently segregated from core Araliaceae (Apiopetalum, Delarbrea, Myodocarpus, and Pseudosciadium) are reported as n = 12. The formerly apiaceous Hydrocotyle (now placed in Araliaceae) is best interpreted as x = 12, although some aneuploid species may exist with x = 9. Hydrocotyle also exhibits extensive variation in ploidal level. Within Araliaceae, chromosomal variation is largely related to ploidal level, with relatively few cases of aneuploidy, such as those documented in Panax ginseng and Hydrocotyle. The available data are largely consistent with the hypothesis that the basic chromosome number of Apiales is x = 6.
10.2307/4135566|We investigated morphological and DNA sequence data for studying the composition and phylogenetic relatonship of the Lecointea clade sensu Herendeen and for testing its monophyly. Twenty nine representing 14 genera were analyzed, including all members of the Lecointea clade and some species of the genera Acosmium, Luetzelburgia, Sweetia, Vatairea and Vataireopsis. Ateleia herbert-smithii, Bocoa mollis, and Myrocarpus frondosus were included as outgroup. Matrices were analyzed using maximum parsimony. Analyses of morphological data, chloroplast DNA trnL sequence data, and combined datasets resulted in similar tree topologies. The Lecointea clade sensu Herendeen, with the additional inclusion of Uribea, is monophyletic in all analyses. Exostyles and Harleyodendron belong to the Lecointea clade and not to the Vatairea clade as recently proposed by Pennington & al.
10.2307/4135569|The proper identities of Hura siamensium J. Koenig 1783 and Globba versicolor Sm. 1805 along with the history of the nomenclature surrounding these species are discussed. Both names have dropped out of common usage today due to early confusion over the identities of these taxa. It is found that the current names in use for these taxa, G. pendula Roxb. 1810 and G. leucantha Miq. 1860, are to be retained. It has now been recommended by the Spermatophyta Committee that G. siamensium (J. Koenig) Rao and Verma 1972 is to be treated as a homonym of G. siamensis (Hemsl.) Hemsl. 1895, an unrelated species. The name G versicolor clearly refers to the same taxon as G. leucantha, but, for nomenclatural reasons, the name must be considered a synonym of H. siamensium.
10.2307/4135570|In the first half of 19th century Jan Fryderyk Wolfgang (1775-1859) was the outstanding expert on Potamogetonaceae. Twelve of the names he proposed in a manuscript of a monograph on Potamogeton were validly published by Schultes & Schultes (1827). Of these, four names are now the correct names for the respective taxa, one for a species (P. rutilus Wolfg.) and three for hybrids (P. x nerviger Wolfg., P. x salicifolius Wolfg. and P. x undulatus Wolfg.). Ten names of Potamogeton taxa described by Wolfgang are typified in this paper, together with two names proposed by his collaborators, Besser and Gorski. The identity of these names is discussed.
10.2307/4135571|Seven names of macrofossil taxa belonging to Podocarpaceae are here validated; they were all previously published but not validly so under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. The names apply to species in the genera Acmopyle Pilg. [A. setiger (Townrow) R. S. Hill & R. J. Carp, ex R. R. Mill & R. S. Hill], Dacrycarpus (Endl.) de Laub. [D. praecupressinus (Ettingsh.) D. R. Greenw. ex R. R. Mill & R. S. Hill], Falcatifolium de Laub. [F. eocenicum (D. R. Greenw.) R. S. Hill & L. J. Scriven ex R. R. Mill & R. S. Hill], Prumnopitys Phil. [P. tasmanica (Townrow) D. R. Greenw. ex R. R. Mill & R. S. Hill], Sigmaphyllum R. S. Hill & L. J. Scriven [S. australe (D. R. Greenw.) R. S. Hill & L. J. Scriven ex R. R. Mill & R. S. Hill], Smithtonia R. S. Hill & M. Pole [S. lanceolata (D. R. Greenw.) R. S. Hill & M. Pole ex R. R. Mill & R. S. Hill] and Willungia R. S. Hill & M. Pole [W. maslinensis (D. T. Blackburn) R. S. Hill & M. Pole ex R. R. Mill & R. S. Hill]. All these combinations were originally published without exact basionym references; instead, the authors cited the complete pagination of the paper in which the intended basionym was made.
10.2307/4135572|Typification of Linnaean plant names involves consideration of Linnaeus's original sources of information (collections and illustrations) in association with each protologue (Cannon & al., 1983; Jarvis & Cafferty, 2003). In the indigenous Araceae of the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands there are some Linnaean names, Arum arisarum L., A. maculatum L. and A. pictum L. f., whose types are established (Savage, 1945; Boyce, 1993). However, the nomenclatural and taxonomical revision of Arum, Arisarum and Helicodiceros for the "Flora Iberica" project (Castroviejo, 1986-2003) has required us to resolve some typifications that were not included in the recent monographs of Arisarum (Boyce, 1990) and Helicodiceros (Boyce, 1994), and which we believe have not been made elsewhere. As part of a study of Iberian and Balearic Araceae, two Linnaean names, Arum proboscideum L. and A. muscivorum L. f., are lecto- and neotypified, respectively.
10.2307/4135573|Lectotypes, neotypes and epitypes are designated by 20 specialists for 45 previously untypified Linnaean plant names belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. These newly proposed types support the current usage of the names concerned. Earlier but ineffective or supersedable type statements are discussed.
10.2307/4135574|Rupert Barneby (1964) expressed "doubts of the legality" in adopting "Astragalus tenellus Pursh" (1813) over A. multiflorus (Pursh) A. Gray (1864). His concern was justified since Pursh invalidated his own name when he simultaneously published Ervum multtflorum (the basionym of A. multiflorus) on a different page in the same work and cited "A. tenellus" in synonymy. By the time Astragalus tenellus Pursh ex E. Sheld. (1894) was validly published, it was a later homonym as well as superfluous. Given the status of A. tenellus Bunge (1869), the name of an Old World species in current use, conservation of A. tenellus Pursh ex E. Sheld. is unlikely, and we recommend adoption of A. multiflorus for the North American plant.
10.2307/4135575|The names Cistus ericoides Cav. and C. laevis Cav. are typified. These names apply to two species, currently classified within the genus Fumana (Dunal) Spach, but the names have been frequently misapplied and both of them pose typification problems. The type specimen of the first has not been found. Thus an illustration is chosen as type and an epitype designated. The original material of C. laevis comprises a mixture of two different species. One element is selected to clarify the application of this binomial.
10.2307/4135576|The name Magnolia odoratissima Y. W. Law & R. Z. Zhou is reinstated as legitimate, because the supposed earlier homonym M odoratissima Reinw. ex Blume has never been validly published. Therefore, later publication of the new name M lawiana Sima & H. Yu to replace Magnolia odoratissima Y. W. Law & R. Z. Zhou is nomenclaturally superfluous.
10.2307/25065299|Relationships of and within the Rubiaceae tribe Cinchoneae were estimated based on DNA sequence variation in five loci: the ITS region, the matK and rbcL genes, the rps16 intron, and the trnL-F region including the trnL intron and the trnL-F intergenic spacer. Within Cinchonoideae s.s., the tribe Naucleeae is the sister group of a clade that comprises all other taxa. Cinchoneae and Isertieae s.s., are strongly supported as sister groups. The tribe Cinchoneae is strongly supported as monophyletic in a restricted sense, including the genera Cinchona, Cinchonopsis, Joosia, Ladenbergia, Remijia and Stilpnophyllum. There is strong support that these genera are monophyletic as presently conceived, except that one species mostly referred to Remijia is of uncertain phylogenetic affinity. To accommodate this species and a morphologically closely similar one, a new genus, Ciliosemina A. Antonelli, is proposed and two new combinations are made.
10.2307/25065300|We used chloroplast DNA sequences from matK and rbcL to infer the phylogeny for 101 of the approximately 111 species of Pinus (Pinaceae). At the level of subsection and above, the cpDNA tree is congruent with phylogenies based on nuclear DNA with one notable exception: cpDNA sequences from subsect. Contortae are sister to all other North American hard pines rather than occupying a more derived position in the same clade. We used the cpDNA tree plus evidence from nuclear ribosomal DNA and morphology to propose a new classification for the genus. The molecular phylogenies are symmetrical at the deepest branches of the genus, allowing for the delineation of two subgenera, each with two sections that form sister groups. Within sections, clades were slightly asymmetric and sometimes ambiguously resolved. To accomodate ambiguity in some interrelationships, avoid the creation of new ranks, and retain traditional names, we recognised up to three monophyletic subsections per section. Subgenus Pinus (the diploxylon, or hard pines) is divided into the predominantly Eurasian and Mediterranean section Pinus, composed of subsections Pinus and Pinaster, and the strictly North American section Trifoliae, composed of subsections Australes, Ponderosae, and Contortae. Subgenus Strobus (the haploxylon, or soft pines) is divided into the strictly North American section Parrya, composed of subsections Cembroides, Nelsoniae, and Balfourianae, and the Eurasian and North American section Quinquefoliae, composed of subsections Gerardianae, Krempfianae, and Strobus. Mapping of ten morphological and distributional characters indicates that two were diagnostic for infrageneric taxa: the number of vascular bundles per leaf distinguishes subgenus Pinus from subgenus Strobus, and a terminal-positioned umbo on the ovulate cone scale is diagnostic of subsect. Strobus.
10.2307/25065301|Wild tomatoes (Solanum section Lycopersicon) are native to western South America. The delimitation and relationships of tomato species have differed widely depending upon whether morphological or biological species concepts are considered more important. Molecular data from mitochondrial, nuclear, and chloroplast DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), nuclear microsatellites, isozymes, and gene sequences of internal transcribed spacers of nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS; multiple-copy), the single-copy nuclear encoded Granule-bound Starch Synthase gene (GBSSI or waxy), and morphology, have been used to examine hypotheses of species relationships. This study is a companion to the previous GBSSI gene sequence study and to the morphological study of relationships of all ten wild tomato species (including the recently described S. galapagense), with a concentration on the most widespread and variable species S. peruvianum s.l. These new AFLP data are largely concordant with the GBSSI and morphological data and in general support the species outlined in the latest treatment by C.M. Rick, but demonstrate the distinct nature of northern and southern Peruvian populations of S. peruvianum, and suggest that their taxonomy needs revision. Solanum ochranthum is supported as sister to wild tomatoes, and S. habrochaites and S. pennellii reside in a basal polytomy in the tomato clade.
10.2307/25065302|A cladistic analysis of morphological data for the genus Canistropsis is presented. With the exception of two species, C. selloana and C. correia-araujoi, results support Canistropsis as monophyletic. Canistropsis correia-araujoi is a suspected, natural bigeneric hybrid. Canistropsis selloana is transferred back into the monotypic genus Andrea. A taxonomic treatment, including a greatly emended description, and discussion of the distribution, habitat, and conservation of Andrea selloana is presented.
10.2307/25065303|Seed morphology of 22 species, representing all seven genera of the tribe Hyoscyameae (Anisodus Link, Archihyoscyamus A. M. Lu, Atropanthe Pascher, Hyoscyamus L., Physochlaina G. Don, Przewalskia Maxim. and Scopolia Jacq.) and two putatively related genera in Solanaceae (Atropa L. and Mandragora L.) was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in order to evaluate this character for use in systematic analysis. Considerable differences exist in the seed coat morphology both among and within genera in the tribe. The results indicate that the seed coat sculpture of the seeds is irregularly striate-reticulate or cerebelloid in Anisodus and reticulate in all the remaining genera and species. Two types of testal cells can be identified based on their general overall shape and linearity of the anticlinal walls. In one type, the cell shape is isodiametric and varies from polygonal to suborbicular, with the anticlinal wall being nearly straight; in the other type, the cell is irregular in shape, usually not isodiametric, with the anticlinal wall variously sinuate. Fibrils, common in other Solanaceae, are found only in Mandragora. Fine ornamentation of the anticlinal walls of the testal cells varies from smooth to covered with granular, laminar or tuberculate projections. Size and shape of the seeds, and the position of the hilum, appear to be of little systematic significance, but testal cell shape and lateral wall ornamentation are potentially of importance in the taxonomy and phylogeny of the tribe Hyoscyameae. Some of the currently circumscribed genera of the tribe appear not to be monophyletic, but taxonomic decisions must be made with a full suite of morphological, molecular and other data.
10.2307/25065304|Gochnatia lanceolata was described on the basis of two collections: the type (Carolina 01) from Peru and a paratype (Torrico & Peca 336) from Bolivia. The morphological characters analyzed here (e.g., style branches, apical anther appendages, phyllaries, pollen, and leaf anatomy) show that these specimens belong to different taxa. A new combination in Chucoa (Chucoa lanceolata) is proposed for the type collection from Peru. A new species, Gochnatia angustifolia, is described on the basis of the paratype from Bolivia.
10.2307/25065305|The genera Gomphocalyx and Phylohydrax (Rubiaceae) have been invariably placed in the tribe Spermacoceae s.s. based on the uni-ovulate ovary locules and pluri-aperturate pollen grains. Sequence data from the rps16 intron and the rbcL gene here presented exclude Gomphocalyx and Phylohydrax from Spermacoceae s.s. The two genera are closely related and their nearest relatives are found among members of the former tribe Hedyotideae. This position may be surprising at first, because the growth form of Phylohydrax is similar to some observed in Spermacoceae s.s. A detailed survey of morphological and anatomical characters shows, however, that the character states of the two genera are largely consistent with the here-proposed position in Hedyotideae. The creeping growth form, the uni-ovulate ovaries and the pluri-colporate pollen grains of Gomphocalyx and Phylohydrax are the result of convergence between this pair of genera and Spermacoceae s.s. The taxonomic position of Lathraeocarpa, sometimes considered closely related to Gomphocalyx, is also discussed.
10.2307/25065306|Two new, primitive quillwort species, I. udupiensis and I. divyadarshanii, are described from peninsular India. Cytologically both species are diploid and unique for India in having 22 chromosomes without fragments. Megaspores of both species are monomorphic, whereas in the previously described species, they are di-to polymorphic. Isoetes udupiensis is unique in having deltoid-shaped megaspores and dominant microspory. The similarity in morphology of both species to subgenus Euphyllum and to the remaining Indian species of subgenus Isoetes, suggests that they may be connecting links between primitive and derived forms within the genus in India.
10.2307/25065307|Re-examination of the type material and micropreparations of "Thayeriorhizomoxylon chandrae Patil & Datar" (published as "T. chandraii"; Late Cretaceous, Maastrichtian) has revealed that the so-called branched rhizome is a petiolar base of the "Acrostichum type". The overall morpho-anatomy of the petiole plus root morphology are similar to that of Acrostichum intertrappeum. In light of above, T. chandrae is being realigned to A. intertrappeum Bonde & Kumaran.
10.2307/25065308|Viscin threads are here described for the exine of Circaea intermedia Ehrh. (C. alpina L.  C. lutetiana L.). Often, the threads bifurcate, taper distally and have branched terminal ends. The smooth surface has lightly sculptured bands and randomly occurring and positioned sporopollenin globules. At the point of attachment with the exine the threads show either a natural transition with exine surface elements or have bulb-like enlargements. Circaea intermedia viscin threads present a remarkable contrast to the generally poorly defined viscin threads on Circaea pollen.
10.2307/25065311|Herbarium records have been widely used in biogeographical and ecological studies for decades. To test the adequacy of using herbarium records, we used residuals, calculated from the regression of the number of herbarium records on minimum residence time of Crotalaria species naturalized in Taiwan, as a predictor of species actual frequency and invasiveness. Number of positive localities (localities where a particular species is present), net infested area, maximum cover, as well as reproductive traits, were estimated for five exotic Crotalaria species with a similar minimum residence time. The tight correlation between residuals and the number of positive localities, as well as with maximum cover, confirms that herbarium records accurately reflect some aspects of the invasion success of the studied species. However, residuals were not a significant predictor of net infested area. Strong correlations between residuals and reproductive traits contributing to species fitness, including log(seeds/plant), flowers/inflorescence, inflorescences/plant, and flowers/plant supported the use of herbarium records in representing field distributions and invasiveness.
10.2307/25065312|Two Linnaean names, Othonna sibirica and Cineraria glauca, for species of Asteraceae tribe Senecioneae are lectotypified. The lectotype of the former name is a specimen in the Linnaean Herbarium in Stockholm (S), and the lectotype of the latter is a plate published by Gmelin in 1752, cited by Linnaeus. Both species belong now to the genus Ligularia Cass., as L. sibirica (L.) Cass. and L. glauca (L.) O. Hoffm., respectively.
10.2307/25065313|Smilax regelii Killip & C. V. Morton (1936), universally applied to an economically important Central American sarsaparilla, is a nomen novum for an illegitimate later homonym, S. grandifolia Regel (1856, non Buckley, 1843), which has been declared recently to be a synonym of the South American S. longifolia Rich. and typified with material allegedly belonging thereto. Regel's description and relevant historical specimens indicate that Regel's concept of S. grandifolia does not make it synonymous with the South American S. longifolia but with the Central American taxon now called S. regelii. Demonstrably original material of S. grandifolia has not been located. A recently designated neotype of S. grandifolia, also not found and never seen by Regel, is in serious conflict with the protologue and must be rejected (Art. 9.17b). To maintain current nomenclature, S. grandifolia Regel is neotypified with an element, probably seen by Regel, whose origin is presumably from Central America. The correct name for Honduran or brown sarsaparilla remains S. regelii Killip & C. V. Morton.
10.2307/25065314|The name Spergularia diandra, representing a plant native to the Mediterranean region of Europe and Africa eastward to central Asia and introduced sparingly to North America, was validly published via an autographic label distributed in 1851, predating other commonly seen citations of this combination.
10.2307/25065315|Vaillant's pioneer work on Compositae systematics has been generally dismissed as unimportant for nomenclatural purposes, being pre-Linnaean. However, a German translation of it was published in 1754, about one year after the starting-point date of botanical nomenclature. In order to assess its possible impact on generic nomenclature, a thorough analysis of Vaillant's concepts, particularly at the level of genus and species, is presented here. Vaillant subdivided the Compositae into three "classes", essentially equivalent to Cardueae, Cichorieae and the remaining tribes, and further into "sections" (14), genera (107) and species (1144). By the study of literature and, to a minor extent, herbaria, 852 of the species (>74%) have been identified, and the identifications are listed in an Appendix. The definition and nomenclatural status of all genera has been verified and their names typified, whereby Vaillant's views and their impact on early Compositae systematics are clarified. In practical terms, the positive and negative effects of the nomenclatural restoration of Vaillant's names are balanced. It is not advisable to blacklist the work as a whole, because its negative effects can be taken care of effectively by just six conservation/rejection proposals (made separately). Among the positive aspects are availability of a suitable name (Rhaponticoides) for a genus that had become nameless (due to conservation of Centaurea L. with a new type); resurrection of Rhaponticum to settle a long lasting and unresolved nomenclatural controversy; and redemption of the otherwise illegitimate but widely used name Volutaria. As an aside, four of the names considered to be correct for Vaillant's taxa, which did not so far exist in the appropriate combination, are validated (in the genera Cullumia, Hymenolepis, Symphyotrichum and Tanacetum).
10.2307/25065336|The type collection database of the herbarium of the University of Gttingen (GOET), containing about 8000 type specimens of vascular plants and bryophytes, is now accessible online at http://www.gwdg.de/sysbot/Typen/default.htm. The website provides data and interactive photographs (habit, detail, and label) of each type specimen. The type database was transferred from Microsoft Access to Oracle and deployed on the web using the Oracle Designer. Two web applications were developed: one only for data queries, the other with an additional option for data editing (entry, update). Data editing by authorised persons is possible from any computer with internet access.
10.2307/25065358|The earliest diversifications of land plants in Ordovician and Silurian times are unclear, mainly due to a lack of macrofossils. The increasing wealth of molecular data, however, converges on the view that bryophytes are paraphyletic with only one of its classes being sister to all other land plants and another bryophyte clade being sister to the tracheophytes. We continue to explore mitochondrial gene regions with respect to their unique modes of gene expression such as RNA editing and trans-splicing and their phylogenetic information potential. Plant mitochondrial genes drift slowly in sequence and mitochondrial introns are mostly stable in position, yet vary in occurrence between clades. These two features make mitochondrial DNA an attractive reservoir of old phylogenetic information. On the other hand, there is striking structural plasticity of mitochondrial DNA (the chondriome) in embryophytes, which grossly contrasts with the conservative evolution of chloroplast DNA (the plastome) in the land plant lineage. We find that mitochondrial intron occurrence strongly adds to the view of the deepest dichotomy separating liverworts and all non-liverwort embryophytes. Other intron occurrences, including the presence of ancestors of trans-splicing group II introns, tend to place hornworts as a sister group to tracheophytes, a grouping that we find corroborated by most multi-gene analyses. Furthermore, conserved intron sequences add phylogenetic resolution within clades. The use of gene spacers for phylogenetic analysis, as commonly investigated in chloroplast DNA, has so far been precluded in plant mitochondria due to rampant recombination of the chondriome, at least in tracheophytes. To investigate whether at least some ancestral gene orders are still conserved among bryophytes and provide useful phylogenetic information, we have recently explored the nad5-nad4-nad2 gene arrangement. We find it conserved, yet with strikingly different modes of evolution in the two spacers.
10.2307/25065359|The phylogenetic history of and evolutionary trends within the simple thalloid liverworts (Jungermanniopsida, subclass Metzgeriidae) are reconstructed in a combined analysis of molecular and morphological data. The molecular dataset comprises loci from all three genomes, including trnL-F, rps4, rbcL, atp and psbA from the chloroplast, SSU rRNA and LSU rRNA from the nucleus, and nad5 from the mitochondrion, and 65 characters are scored in the morphological dataset. An initial analysis of a molecular dataset that included 16 outgroup and 50 ingroup taxa resolved a Haplomitrium/Treubiaceae clade as the earliest diverging lineage of the ingroup. Subsequent analyses of ingroup only datasets, rooted on this clade, resolve Metzgeriidae as paraphyletic, with Blasiaceae sister to Marchantiopsida in all analyses. A combined analysis of morphological and molecular datasets resolves basically the same clades as analyses of the molecular dataset alone, except for the resolution of a weak sister group relationship between Metzgeriineae and the leafy liverworts. Reconstructions of morphological character evolution on the combined analysis topology confirm that there is substantial homoplasy in the morphology dataset, even in characters that have been traditionally considered diagnostic of hierarchial relationships, such as apical cell geometry, calyptral type and capsule wall thickness. Ancestral state reconstructions contradict many prevailing hypotheses of character evolution in hepatics, including the model of the ancestral liverwort prototype as an erect, radially symmetric plant. Instead, a more likely model is a prostrate, bilaterally symmetric plant with the diagnostic features of a simple thalloid liverwort.
10.2307/25065360|Maximum likelihood analyses based on the internal transcribed spacer region of nuclear ribosomal DNA and the chloroplast protein coding gene rps4 were conducted to investigate phylogenetic relationships among species of Plagiochila and to reconstruct the ranges of natural species groups within the genus. Based on the results of the molecular analyses and on morphological evidence, the tropical African species of Plagiochila are assigned to the sections Arrectae, Cucullatae, Hylacoetes, Rutilantes, Vagae, and the new sect. Africanae (P. barteri, P. colorans). With the exception of Africanae, all sections possess intercontinental ranges; their centers of diversity are in the tropics. Clade and species diversity in Africa is lower than in other parts of the tropics and may reflect drought periods of the Pleistocene. Intercontinental ranges at specific level exist between tropical America and Africa whereas similarities between tropical Asia and Africa were only recovered at the sectional level. ITS sequence sets were used to test the monophyly of species with intercontinental ranges and to explore the development of the Afro-American range of P. boryana. A well supported clade with accessions of P. boryana from Bolivia and Uganda is nested in the robust neotropical Hylacoetes. This topology and the low genetic distance of the different P. boryana accessions provide some evidence for long-range dispersal of P. boryana eastwards across the Atlantic, originating from the Neotropics. An African origin of the Vagae clade which includes neotropical and paleotropical taxa is suggested by the clustering of accessions from the East African Islands at the base of this clade. In addition, the presented data support the hypothesis of several switches from Africa to Asia and vice versa. A derived clade within Vagae includes accessions from the African mainland and the Neotropics. Our results seem to indicate that the extant tropical African Plagiochila flora is a mixture of old elements and rather recent immigrants.
10.2307/25065361|Using a modified DNeasy Plant Mini Kit method to extract DNA, we were able to isolate DNA from 100-year-old liverwort herbarium specimens. We sucessfully isolated DNA from 18 specimens of the liverwort Bazzania trilobata collected during the
10.2307/25065362|Taxonomic and molecular data were utilized to test the hypothesis that moss diversity is greatest near the equator. Species richness estimates from 86 taxonomic checklists representing global moss diversity do not support the hypothesis that, in general, mosses are more species-rich in the tropics than at higher latitudes. A significant latitudinal gradient was, however, detected for North, Central, and South American samples when analyzed alone. Taxonomic estimates of biodiversity patterns were compared to molecular estimates based on standing nucleotide diversity, and on phylogenetic diversity, the latter taking into account the historical information contained in a molecular phylogenetic tree for the mosses. Molecular estimates suggest that moss diversity is highest in the Southern Hemisphere and lowest in the Northern Hemisphere, with the tropics having an intermediate level. The differences, however, are slight, and analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicate that there is virtually no generalized differentiation between major latitudinal zones. These results reflect the fact that virtually all moss lineages have representatives in all three latitudinal zones. At the nucleotide level, mosses best fit the pattern of "everything is everywhere".
10.2307/25065363|A recent survey of arthrodontous mosses revealed that their chloroplast genome lacks the gene encoding the alpha subunit of the RNA polymerase (i.e., rpoA), and that at least in Physcomitrella patens the gene has been transferred to the nuclear genome. Subsequently the gene was recorded from the cytoplasmic genome in Takakia and Sphagnum. Here we extend the survey to representatives of all major lineages of mosses to determine when in the evolutionary history of the Bryophyta the loss took place. Amplifications using primers annealing to the flanking regions of the rpoA gene yield a product that contains the gene in Takakia, Sphagnum, Andreaea, Oedipodium, Polytrichaceae, and Buxbaumia. The gene is lacking in all arthrodontous mosses, including Diphyscium but also in both species of Tetraphis. Reconstruction of the transfer on the phylogeny of mosses suggests (a) that the rpoA gene was lost twice and (b) that the gene was lost after the divergence of Buxbaumiidae and prior to the divergence of Diphyscium from the remaining Bryopsida.
10.2307/25065364|Bayesian analysis of an alignment of 83 nrITS sequences belonging to 66 taxa of Pottiaceae revealed representatives of subfamily Trichostomoideae in a well supported monophyletic lineage. Two robust clades within Trichostomoideae include species of Tortella and Weissia, respectively. Eucladium verticillatum is part of Trichostomoideae, and Anoectangium, Gymnostomum, Hymenostylium, and Tuerckheimia form a robust basal clade. Affinities of Hyophila and Leptobarbula to Trichostomoideae are unclear. Within Trichostomoideae, Pleurochaete squarrosa is resolved in Tortella while Trichostomum tenuirostris, Pseudosymblepharis, and Chionoloma are placed as a separate genus or part of a broadly defined Tortella. The type species of Trichostomum, T. brachydontium, is nested in Weissia together with T. brittonianum, T. crispulum, and T. jamaicensis. Trichostomum unguiculatum and W. ayresii are resolved as closely related and separate from the rest of the Weissia clade. The genus Astomum, erected for cleistocarpous species of Weissia, is also nested within Weissia. Genetic divergence between selected accessions of Weissia controversa and Astomum is sometimes smaller than between accessions of Weissia controversa.
10.2307/25065365|ITS, rps4, and atpB-rbcL sequences were used to test recent taxonomic rearrangements in the moss genus Brachytheciastrum. A starting phylogenetic hypothesis of Brachytheciaceae was used to subsample representative genera of each subfamily to obtain a robust backbone phylogeny and circumscribe Brachytheciastrum within the family. The strongly supported monophyletic Brachytheciastrum clade includes B. bellicum Vanderpoorten, Ignatov, Huttunen & Goffinet, comb. nov., B. collinum, B. dieckei, B. falcatulum, B. fendleri Vanderpoorten, Ignatov, Huttunen & Goffinet, comb. nov., B. leibergii, B. olympicum Vanderpoorten, Ignatov, Huttunen & Goffinet, comb. nov., B. trachypodium, and B. velutinum. No morphological synapomorphy was found for Brachytheciastrum due to the high uncertainty associated with the reconstruction of character states at the ancestor node of the genus. The revised circumscription of Brachytheciastrum has several consequences for the taxonomy of Brachytheciaceae. New infrafamilial rearrangements and combinations are discussed.
10.2307/25065366|Circumscription, intraspecific variation, and biogeography of five Campylopus species of putative Gondwanan origin, C. flexuosus, C. fragilis, C. pyriformis, C. savannarum, and C. thwaitesii, are evaluated based on parsimony and likelihood analyses of nuclear ribosomal ITS1 / ITS2 and chloroplast atpB-rbcL spacer sequences, and are compared with those of C. introflexus and C. pilifer. Campylopus introflexus and C. thwaitesii are monophyletic with low intraspecific sequence variation; specimens of C. savannarum appear on one well-supported clade together with two closely related species. In contrast, specimens of C. flexuosus, C. fragilis, C. pilifer, and C. pyriformis do not form monophyletic groups but are spread over several clades, which partly correspond to geographical regions. Apparently, these morphologically defined species are comprised of groups of populations that are morphologically similar due to convergent evolution. It is concluded that the circumscription and distribution patterns of these widespread Campylopus species are to be revised.

10.2307/25065368|Tribe Gloxinieae has been estimated to include 22 genera and approximately 290 species. This study presents maximum parsimony phylogenetic analyses of nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer regions sequences, the chloroplast DNA trnL intron and trnL-trnF intergenic spacer region sequences, a morphological cladistic dataset, and combined analyses of these datasets. These analyses suggest that the genera Gloxinia, Phinaea, and (possibly) Diastema are polyphyletic; Kohleria is paraphyletic in relation to Capanea; Bellonia and Pheidonocarpa should be considered members of tribe Gesnerieae; and Lembocarpus is a member of tribe Episcieae. Furthermore, the historically recognized genus Seemannia, now included in Gloxinia, appears to form a strongly supported monophyletic group; several Gloxinia species from southern Brazil appear to be most closely related to Goyazia; Capanea, Kohleria, Pearcea s.l., and Diastema vexans appear to form a strongly supported clade; and Diastema, Monopyle, Phinaea (in part), and a few Gloxinia species (Gloxinia dodsonii, G. lindeniana, and G. racemosa) form a clade. Classification issues and generic boundaries of these lineages are discussed in detail.
10.2307/25065369|A phylogenetic study of plastid DNA sequences (ndhF, trnL/F, and rps16) in Lamiales is presented. In particular, the inclusiveness of Scrophulariaceae sensu APG II is elaborated. Scrophulariaceae in this sense are mainly a southern hemisphere group, which includes Hemimerideae (including Alonsoa, with a few South American species), Myoporeae, the Central American Leucophylleae (including Capraria), Androya, Aptosimeae, Buddlejeae, Teedieae (including Oftia, Dermatobotrys, and Freylinia), Manuleeae, and chiefly Northern temperate Scrophularieae (including Verbascum and Oreosolen). Camptoloma and Phygelius group with Buddlejeae and Teedieae, but without being well resolved to any of these two groups. Antherothamnus is strongly supported as sister taxon to Scrophularieae. African Stilbaceae are shown to include Bowkerieae and Charadrophila. There is moderate support for a clade of putative Asian origin and including Phrymaceae, Paulownia, Rehmannia, Mazus, Lancea, and chiefly parasitic Orobanchaceae, to which Brandisia is shown to belong. A novel, strongly supported, clade of taxa earlier assigned to Scrophulariaceae was found. The clade includes Stemodiopsis, Torenia, Micranthemum and probably Picria and has unclear relationships to the rest of Lamiales. This clade possibly represents the tribe Lindernieae, diagnosed by geniculate anterior filaments, usually with a basal swelling.
10.2307/25065370|Bayesian inference analyses of nuclear LSU rDNA sequences showed Verrucariales and Eurotiales to form the sistergroup of Mycocaliciales. A more detailed analysis of ITS rDNA sequences showed Sphinctrinaceae to be embedded in Mycocaliciaceae. Mycocaliciales contain two major lineages. Intron occurrence and phylogeny was partly congruent with the ITS-based phylogeny. Chaenothecopsis is paraphyletic with respect to Phaeocalicium, Mycocalicium, Sphinctrina and Stenocybe. Some morphological features traditionally used for characterising Chaenothecopsis and other genera in Mycocaliciales, such as ascus apex structure and stalk anatomy, were found to be homoplasious, while others, such as spore septation, intron distribution and nutritional biology, were consistent with major clades in the analysis. Within the two major clades of Mycocaliciales some subclades are strongly supported and well characterized by anatomical, nutritional and intron features.
10.2307/25065371|This paper reviews interpretations of the morphology and evolution of the bryophyte sporophyte, and proposes a scenario for the early evolution of the land plant sporophyte. Paleobotanical and neobotanical evidence implies that the earliest land plants were bryophyte-like and diverged to bryophytes and pteridophytes. The current hypothesis for the sporophyte evolution is that the seta, i.e., an axis bearing the sporangium of bryophytes, elaborated to the ramified polysporangiophyte stem. From comparison of reported developmental data with a special focus on the apical cell and other meristems, we propose that the entire bryophyte sporophyte is a footed sporangium (sporogonium) with or without a seta. The seta is interpreted as a sporangial stalk and is not homologous to the stem of polysporangiate plants. Having the persistent apical meristem, the shoot of polysporangiate plants seems to be a novel vegetative organ interpolated in the life cycle, while the sporogonium evolved to the sporangium separated from the foot and later produced on the stem or leaf.
10.2307/25065372|A new species, Mucuna japira A. M. G. Azevedo, Agostini & Sazima, is described from Brazil. It has features similar to M. sloanei Fawc. & Rendle, but has pseudo-racemose inflorescences and the standard petal measures 3/4 of the length of the keel, whereas M. sloanei has umbellate inflorescences and the standard petal measures 1/2 of the length of the keel. This new species is restricted to the Atlantic forest of coastal So Paulo, Southeastern Brazil. A key to Brazilian species is provided.
10.2307/25065373|Modern approaches to Flora writing are increasingly being built around database technology. Databases allow for great flexibility in the range of questions that can be asked of the Flora, and consequently greatly enhance the utility of the Flora in the core roles of identification of species and nomenclatural queries. There are, however, few examples where existing floristic works have been converted into database format, so that much of our legacy of floristic texts still rests in the form of the printed page. In this paper we address the problem of the digitisation of legacy texts (see www.kew.org/efloras/). We describe a method that we used to create an online database of the Flora Zambesiaca for identification and nomenclatural queries. We assert that the method we used can be generalised to cope with most standard taxonomic formats. We conclude that on a cost-benefit basis Flora digitisation compares very favourably to other digitisation approaches, such as specimen databasing and interactive key construction, and could be used with good effect to direct digitisation in these other areas.
10.2307/25065374|Lectotypes, neotypes and epitypes are designated by 10 specialists for 27 previously untypified Linnaean plant names belonging to the family Ranunculaceae.

10.2307/25065376|A review is presented of the original material cited in the protologue of Metasequoia glyptostroboides. It is determined that there were two syntypes and seven paratypes. One of the syntypes is designated as lectotype.
10.2307/25065377|The original lectotype for the name Cuscuta europaea var. epithymum L. was based on a specimen from LINN that is not original material. The sole extant original element for the name is deposited in the Burser herbarium in UPS. The previous lectotype is here superseded with the designation of the Burser specimen. Comments on the valid publication of the combination C. epithymum (L.) L. are also included.

10.2307/25065379|The nomenclatural status and history of the generic name Isaria are reviewed. Authorship and typification are discussed, and we conclude that Isaria Pers.: Fr. is a validly published generic name that has previously been effectively and appropriately lectotypified by Isaria farinosa (Holm: Fr.) Fr. A lectotype illustration and an epitype specimen are designated for I. farinosa. We suggest that the name Isaria be used for species previously assigned to Paecilomyces section Isarioidea Samson. Further taxonomic studies are required to determine the appropriate circumscription of Isaria. Our conclusions preserve a Friesian genus in a familiar sense.

It is therefore unnecessary to conserve Presl's name with a conserved type, as has been proposed. To eliminate any future controversy over the application of the name Orobanche sanguinea, an epitype is designated.
10.2307/25065383|A review is presented of nomenclatural problems in the genus Pleurozia Dumort. including the typification of five binomials relevant to the study of the genus. It is shown that the first lectotypification of Pleurozia by P. sphagnoides Dumort. 1874 can be maintained and that this preserves traditional usage of Pleurozia. The earlier Jungermannia sphagnoides Schwgr. 1814 is shown to be nomenclaturally independent and is newly lectotypified confirming its application to a species of the unrelated genus Schistochila. A new lectotype for Pleurozia purpurea Lindb. 1877 was found necessary, and this is designated from the previously overlooked herbarium of John Lightfoot (K). Mnium jungermannia L. is a heterogeneous element, in the past considered by some to include Pleurozia purpurea; it is lectotypified by a Dillenian illustration, supported by an epitype from Dillenius's herbarium that belongs to Scapania undulata (L.) Dumort. Mnium jungermannia and all names based on it, none of which are in current use, therefore become synonyms of S. undulata. Jungermannia undulata L. [ Scapania undulata (L.) Dumort.], also typified by a Dillenian illustration, is further stabilised in its current application by designation of an epitype in Dillenius's herbarium.
10.2307/25065385|Recent studies have shown that Acacia is polyphyletic and must be split into five genera. Proposal 1584 would retypify Acacia: the type of the Australian taxon A. penninervis would be conserved over the current lectotype (A. scorpioides) of an African taxon. We disagree with the recommendation of the Spermatophyte Committee to endorse this proposal. Contrary to Article 14.12 of the ICBN, no detailed case against conservation was presented in Proposal 1584. We maintain that there are strong arguments against conservation, such as the large number of countries that would be affected, the economic importance of the extra-Australian species, and the economic burden placed on developing countries. Acceptance of this proposal would also violate the guidelines for conservation which clearly state that the principle of priority should prevail when conservation for one part of the world would create disadvantageous change in another part of the world.

10.2307/25065418|The phylogenetic relationships of the lichenised ascomycete family Stereocaulaceae were investigated with partial beta-tubulin, partial glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and SSU rDNA sequence data. Due to the marked length variation in the SSU rDNA sequences, the analyses were performed with direct optimization. The combined analysis of the beta-tubulin, GAPDH and SSU rDNA sequences as well as the separate analyses of beta-tubulin and GAPDH data recognized the monophyletic group comprising Lepraria, Muhria and Stereocaulon. In the combined analysis Stereocaulon tornense appears as a basal taxon in the Stereocaulon clade, suggesting that the crustose growth form and the absence of cephalodia are primitive features within the genus. Muhria is nested in Stereocaulon and groups with the crustose S. cumulatum and S. leucophaeopsis. The genus Lepraria is monophyletic if Leproloma is included, but species that were represented by several specimens in our study, i.e., Lepraria jackii and Leproloma membranaceum, do not appear as monophyletic entities. The genus Pilophorus is included in Cladoniaceae. Combined analysis of the three datasets clearly led to an increase in support values compared to the separate analyses, showing high support for the monophyly of families Cladoniaceae and Stereocaulaceae and for the sistergroup relation for the two families. The relationships between higher groupings did not reach high support values probably due to the incongruencies among the three datasets.
10.2307/25065419|The tribe Pomaderreae (Rhamnaceae) currently consists of approximately 180 species in seven genera, endemic to Australia and New Zealand. It is the second largest tribe of Rhamnaceae. We undertook a phylogenetic analysis using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence data from 69 representative species of Pomaderreae and five outgroup taxa. The monophyly of Pomaderreae was confirmed. The clades found in the strict consensus tree are mostly consistent with the currently accepted genera of the tribe. All major clades, except Stenanthemum, received moderate to strong bootstrap and jackknife support. Only the relationship between Siegfriedia and Pomaderris received strong support; relationships between other genera did not receive support above 50%. Taxonomic changes are suggested and a preliminary classification of Pomaderreae is proposed, including the monophyletic genera Cryptandra, Pomaderris, Spyridium and Trymalium. Blackallia and Siegfriedia are monotypic. Two new genera are required: one containing two atypical species of Stenanthemum and the second genus consisting of previously unrelated species from three genera that share a 2-carpellate ovary and a characteristic indumentum. The taxonomic status of Stenanthemum requires further examination. A split of Cryptandra into smaller genera is not supported.
10.2307/25065420|The systematic positions of the genera Serratula and Klasea were investigated on the basis of nuclear ribosomal DNA internal and external transcribed spacer sequences. Klasea comprises the major part of the species traditionally placed in Serratula. Serratula is part of a clade containing the more derived genera of Centaureinae, whereas Klasea is a basal segregate within the subtribe, possibly sister to the Rhaponticum group. Nikitinia, a monotypic genus whose affinities were supposed by some authors in Carduinae, by others in Centaureinae, clearly belongs to Klasea and is sunk into synonymy of the latter. A total of six new combinations are made in Klasea.
10.2307/25065421|Micromeria Benth. (Lamiaceae, Nepetoideae) is a very common genus in the Mediterranean region. To test the monophyly of the genus and to elucidate its phylogenetic placement within subtribe Menthinae (Dumort) Endl. of tribe Mentheae Dumort we performed parsimony analysis of trnK intron sequence data of 51 accessions representing 15 genera of Nepetoideae and two genera of subfamily Ajugoideae. Tree topology reveals a well-supported "core group" indicating four distinct lineages. The first one comprises three species of Satureja L. s.str., the second one includes taxa of the genus Clinopodium L. from both the Old and the New World, paraphyletic with respect to Monarda L. and two species of Micromeria section Pseudomelissa Benth. A third group contains all samples of the remaining Micromeria species. Within this monophyly, a western lineage including taxa from NW Africa, the Balearic, and the Canary Islands, is sister to an eastern lineage with species distributed from SE Asia to the western Mediterranean. In a further clade the genera Thymbra L., Thymus L., and Origanum L. are grouped together. Combined analysis using a reduced dataset of trnK/trnL-F sequences increased support for the infrageneric resolution within Micromeria. Based on the phylogenetic reconstructions there is evidence that the genus as currently circumscribed is polyphyletic. Results are discussed in the context of morphology, karyology, and biogeography, outlining the necessity of removing section Pseudomelissa from Micromeria.

All of these taxa have the presence of irregularly shaped strips and plates of smooth wall material, each separated by grids that interconnect the plates and strips. These species all also share the presence of well-formed perforations positioned over the middle lamella between the walls of adjacent cells. The grids and perforations are discussed and illustrated with SEM images. The studies of the leaf surfaces of Trabacellula and Mylia reveal closer taxonomic affinities of the two genera than heretofore thought, and an alternative classification and a realignment of these genera to reflect this affinity is suggested. Mylia is recognized in an independent family, Myliaceae (Grolle) Schljakov. The study also reveals that Mylia anomala is best retained in Jungermanniaceae, as a new genus, Leiomylia, and placed in its own subfamily within Jungermanniaceae, Leiomylioideae. It is suggested that Trabacellula is appropriately placed in a separate and distinct family, Trabacellulaceae Fulford. Based upon the linkage of surface features and other similarities, the two families are placed in a new suborder, Subord. Myliineae.
10.2307/25065424|Dendroportulaca mirabilis U. Eggli, a Malagasy liana described as an atypical member of Portulacaceae, was shown by ndhF sequence data to be placed within Amaranthaceae tribe Celosieae, strongly supported as sister to Deeringia polysperma. A re-evaluation of the morphology of Dendroportulaca, including field observations, also supported its placement within Celosieae and in particular its relationship to the existing Malagasy species of Deeringia. Dendroportulaca mirabilis is herein transferred to Deeringia.
10.2307/25065425|Nardophyllum cabrerae (Asteraceae: Astereae), a new species from western Argentina is described. The new species differs from its closest relative, Nardophyllum lanatum (Meyen) Cabrera, in its non-revolute margins, white corollas, and pappus of unequal scabrid bristles. Two names, Nardophyllum obtusifolium Hook. et Arn. and N. bracteolatum Hauman, were shown not to represent distinct species and accordingly placed in the synonymy of Nardophyllum bryoides (Lam.) Cabrera and Nardophyllum chiliotrichioides (J. Rmy in Gay) A. Gray, respectively.
10.2307/25065426|Mimosa lewisii (Section Batocaulon), a shrub of the NE-Brazilian Caatinga, presents huge (pseudo-)racemes that form a separate storey overtopping the foliage. Racemes persist, developing intermittently pedunculate capitula over a period of more than one year. The brush-type, whitish flower heads are nocturnal in anthesis and active only a single night. Florets are relatively large and stout for the genus, hermaphroditic, with stiff filaments and style, and converge towards the periphery of the raceme. When expanding at dusk, the heads produce large nectar drops (up to 173 l per head), that averages 25-29% sucrose. Production starts sequentially among florets of a capitulum. The drops are freely exposed, held between the filaments. The glossophagine bat Lonchophylla mordax was observed as the only legitimate visitor; hummingbirds exploited worn capitula at daytime, but did not pollinate. The bats lapped the nectar while hovering without apparently putting out their tongues. Pollen transmission was by the snout and probably by touching neighbouring flower heads with the wings. The blossoms, of a genus predominantly entomophilous, reveal habitual adaptation to bat pollination in most of their features. Small size (14 mm in diam.) and lack of a perceptible scent suggest that an evolutionary shift towards chiropterophily is still incomplete. A brief survey of the known distribution of bat pollination in Mimosaceae is appended.
10.2307/25065427|Outstanding questions on floral structure in the small family Stemonaceae (Pandanales) include whether the gynoecium is monocarpellary, whether they possess floral nectaries, and how dimery and pentamery evolved in the family. To help resolve these issues we present new data on comparative floral anatomy in three genera of Stemonaceae in the context of a revised phylogenetic analysis using a "total evidence" approach with combined data from three genes (plastid rbcL, atpB and nuclear 18S rDNA) plus morphology. The monocarpellary condition is a synapomorphy for a clade comprising Croomia, Stemona and Stichoneuron, and the unilocular tricarpellary condition is an autapomorphy for Pentastemona. Nectaries are absent, but the densely papillate tepals may function as osmophores, especially in Croomia and Stichnoneuron. The hypothesis that the pentamerous condition in Pentastemona evolved as a result of suppression of an outer tepal and stamen, and thus represents an intermediate stage between trimery and dimery, is not contradicted by its phylogenetic placement as sister to other Stemonaceae, which are dimerous. However, since pentamery also occurs sporadically in the closely related family Triuridaceae, and dimery (and/or tetramery) occur in other Pandanales, this indicates that merism is relatively labile within the order, and that dimery and pentamery have both evolved separately and iteratively from a trimerous condition.
10.2307/25065428|Somatic chromosomes of 17 species belonging to 4 subgenera and 7 sections of Solanum and Lycianthes rantonnei are studied. All taxa have 2n = 24. The chromosome numbers of S. tripartitum, S. tenuispinum, and S. vaillantii are reported for the first time, and the karyotype analysis of L. rantonnei is the first one for the genus. Morphometric chromosome analyses bring estimates of karyotype composition and asymmetry. In general, karyotypes are symmetrical with the chromosomes smaller than 4 m long, being metacentric (69%), submetacentric (24%), or more rarely subtelocentric (7%). Solanum tucumanense, S. palinacanthum, and Solanum sp. (Acanthophora) are unique by having mostly sm and st chromosomes. All species have nucleolar organizing regions and attached satellites of variable size on short arms of one chromosome pair, usually sm or st. All species can be cytologically distinguished. Karyotype data do not allow separation of L. rantonnei from species of Solanum. Results support the validity of S. tucumanense with respect to S. pseudocapsicum. Using chromosome data exclusively, cluster analysis in 10 species from Solanum subgen. Leptostemonum reinforce the systematic arrangement of taxa in subsections based on morphological features. Because of its increased karyotype asymmetry, section Acanthophora appears to be an advanced taxon within subgen. Leptostemonum.
10.2307/25065429|Using Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP), we explored the intraspecific phylogeography of the alpine vascular plant Bupleurum stellatum (Apiaceae), disjunctly distributed in the Alps and Corsica. Within the Alps, the species' distribution area is also not contiguous, spatially isolated groups of populations occuring in the Dolomites (Italy) and the Montafon (Austria). A main goal of our study was to explore the degree of differentiation of the isolated populations in Corsica, the Dolomites and the Montafon from the populations in the main distributional area and to test for hypotheses of vicariance or dispersal. We also sought a better general knowledge of glacial refugia of low alpine silicicolous plants. Phenetic as well as cladistic analyses of the AFLP multilocus phenotypes reveal a substantial north-south split through the contiguous distribution area of B. stellatum in the Alps. The resulting phylogeographic groups can be related to glacial refugia in peripheral areas of the Alps that were recognised in previous studies. The disjunct populations in Corsica, the Dolomites and the Montafon, however, are less strongly differentiated. For example, the Corsican population clustered with high bootstrap support with populations from the Eastern Alps, suggesting immigration to Corsica from that region. Our study shows that deep phylogeographic splits resulting from old vicariance events can be concealed by presently contiguous distribution areas. In contrast, disjunctions, if they are due to dispersal events, need not be accompanied by genetic divergence.
10.2307/25065430|A new fossilized walchian (Voltziales) conifer plant from the Late Pennsylvanian Hamilton Quarry of Kansas, U.S.A. combines morphological characters of the morphogenus Walchia and the fossil plant genus Otovicia, with cuticular characters like those of the fossil plant genus Ernestiodendron, and seed cone morphology like that of the fossil plant genus Emporia. Internal anatomical characters are basically similar to the other walchian genera for which such features are known, but some are taxonomically informative. Numerical cladistic analysis reveals that this novel combination of characters defines a new fossil plant genus and species of walchian conifers Hanskerpia hamiltonensis. This analysis provides a test of hypotheses for relationships among walchian and other ancient conifers. Results of this analysis support some previously proposed relationships among the most primitive conifers and other Paleozoic coniferophytes. However, the analysis also calls to question the validity of all previously proposed familial circumscriptions for walchian conifers, and highlights the perplexing systematic challenges posed by the most ancient fossil conifers. The unexpected species richness of voltzialean conifers is interpreted as having resulted from the evolutionary ecology of unstable environments.
10.2307/25065431|A model for representing taxonomic descriptive data is presented. The model has been developed in response to the growing requirement for the global exchange of descriptive data. Meaningful exchange of data requires that data be represented in a form that can be consistently parsed and interpreted, requiring a common data model and the constrained and explicitly defined use of descriptive terms. The model presented here is divided into two parts that address both of these issues. A new data model for the representation and storage of taxonomic descriptive data is proposed that builds on and extends the best features of current descriptive data models and formats. An ontology-based model for defining and constraining the use of descriptive terms is also presented. The model is based on an analysis of current taxonomic working practices and the processes involved in generating a description. The model takes a specimen-oriented approach allowing descriptive data to be represented through a range of levels of abstraction from actual measurements of structures on a specimen to abstract descriptions of the features expected to be found on a specimen that is a member of a particular taxon. A comparison and discussion of the important aspects of the new model relative to existing models is presented.
10.2307/25065432|In many plant groups, the use of low-copy nuclear sequence markers for phylogenetics and population genetics has been hindered by their limited availability. Although it may be possible to PCR amplify low-copy markers using primers designed for use with other plant groups, this does not always yield the desired results. Here, we suggest several alternative approaches to begin the isolation and characterisation of novel low-copy markers when there is little or no sequence information available. These alternatives are: (1) the design of new primers from information in the sequence databases; (2) isolation of homologous DNA using a gene probe from another organism; (3) characterisation of sequence markers from DNA fingerprints; and (4) obtaining novel sequences via cDNA cloning.
10.2307/25065433|The flower color of daylily (Hemerocallis L.) cultivars at the U. S. National Arboretum, Washington, D.C. was documented using the Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart (RHSCC) and the Munsell Book of Color (MBC). The RHSCC descriptions did not allow discrimination between cultivars that were distinguishable by eye. The MBC, however, allowed the description of colors that fell between color chart chips, and had the ability to compare the specific color attributes of different cultivars of similar color. The ability to interpolate colors with the MBC allows a greater accuracy in documentation and discrimination of floral color.
10.2307/25065434|Supplementing a recent systematic study of Primula sect. Auricula, we here lectotypify or neotypify 27 names applicable to taxa in this section and the name of one related genus. These are P. auricula var. widmerae Pax, P. balbisii Lehm., P. ciliata Moretti, P. cottia Widmer, P. crenata Lam., P. oenensis Thomas ex Gremli, P. glaucescens Moretti, P. glutinosa Wulfen, P. integrifolia L., P. latifolia var. cynoglossifolia Widmer, P. laevigata Duby ex Rchb., P. longobarda Parta, P. lutea Vill., P. marginata Curtis, P. microcalyx Lehm., P. minima L., P. parlatorii Porta ex Caruel, P. villosa Wulfen, P. villosa var. daonensis Leyb., P. viscosa Vill., P. [unranked] Brevibracteae Widmer, P. [unranked] Rufiglandulae Widmer, P. [unranked] Longibracteatae Widmer, P. [unranked] Cartilagineo-marginatae Widmer, P. [unranked] Luteae Widmer, P. [unranked] Nothobritanica Schott and P. [unranked] Saniculina Schott. We also publish two new combinations: P. lutea subsp. widmerae (Pax) L. B. Zhang and P. lutea subsp. tatriaca (L. B. Zhang) L. B. Zhang. We further synonymize 233 names referable to P. sect. Auricula, including P. glaucescens subsp. longobarda (Porta) Widmer, P. grignensis D. M. Moser and P. pedemontana subsp. iberica Losa et P. Monts. Through extensive herbarium and literature surveys, we further located the types of an additional 32 names in the section, many of which had been thought to be lost or unclear to science.
10.2307/25065435|In a forthcoming systematic treatment of Brazilian species of Cryptocarya, almost all known herbarium collections were examined, and as a result, eight validly published species names are recognized. Types are cited for accepted names and synonyms. Several lectotypes and an epitype are newly designated. One new combination is proposed.
10.2307/25065436|Lectotypes and epitypes are designated for seven previously untypified Linnaean plant names belonging to the family Urticaceae. These newly proposed types support the current usage of the names concerned. Earlier but ineffective or supersedable type statements are discussed.
10.2307/25065437|Gamochaeta munnozii Cabrera was proposed as a new name for South American Gnaphalium serpyllifolium Remy (1849), non Bergius (1767). Weddell (1855), however, had proposed Gamochaeta serpyllifolia and included Gnaphalium serpyllifolium Remy in synonymy. Thus, Gamochaeta serpyllifolia is the correct name for this taxon. A lectotype is chosen for Gnaphalium serpyllifolium Remy.
10.2307/25065438|The use of the name Agave wislizeni Engelm. is controversial. There is uncertainty about the type locality, the original description is vague, and the illustrations and specimens that have been associated with this name have only added further to the confusion. According to the description and possible type localities, A. wislizeni could be confused with what is now known as A. parryi Engelm., A. parrasana A. Berger or A. ovatifolia Starr & Villarreal. However, because A. wislizeni was originally proposed as a substitute name for A. scabra Salm-Dyck, its identity can be resolved as a synonym of A. asperrima Jacobi.
10.2307/25065439|While preparing a revision of Rhododendron subgen. Tsutsusi (Ericaceae), we found that Rhododendron huadingense B. Y. Ding & Y. Y. Fang, described from Zhejiang Province in 1990, was not a validly published name because two collections were designated as the type. The name is validated here, with the flowering specimen designated as the holotype.
10.2307/25065440|It has been found that Blachia chunii Y. T. Chang & P. T. Li described from Guangdong Province, China was not validly published because two collections were designated as type. The name is validated here, with the flowering specimen designated as holotype.
10.2307/25065441|"Paeonia rockii subsp. linyanshanii T. Hong & G. L. Osti" was not validly published in 1994 because it was assigned to "Paeonia rockii (S. G. Haw & L. A. Lauener) T. Hong & J. J. Li", which was not then a validly published name. Although the species name was validated in 1998 as Paeonia rockii (S. G. Haw & L. A. Lauener) T. Hong & J. J. Li ex D. Y. Hong, P. rockii subsp. linyanshanii has still not been validly published, although P. suffruticosa var. linyanshanii J. J. Halda was validly published in 1997. P. rockii subsp. linyanshanii is validated here, based on Handa's varietal name, and, because the holotype was not preserved, a neotype is designated.
10.2307/25065442|Evidence is provided that the first person to validly publish a name for the species that Linnaeus termed "Bryum verticillatum" in 1753 was Withering in 1801, and that his name actually constitutes the basionym of the well-known moss name, correctly cited as Eucladium verticillatum (With.) Bruch & Schimp. (Bryophyta, Pottiaceae). "Weissia verticillata (Hedw.) ex Brid." of 1801, which has hitherto been considered the basionym of this binomial, is a nomen nudum; the combination Weissia verticillata was validly published by Bridel in 1806. Bryum verticillatum With. is lectotypified here with a specimen from Cumberland, England, that is preserved at BM.
10.2307/25065444|After a review of the taxonomy and nomenclature of Plasmopara, it is concluded that this genus contains at least two groups of fungi that can be differentiated on both morphological and molecular grounds. In order to avoid numerous nomenclatural changes, the genus Plasmoverna with seven new combinations (Pv. pygmaea, Pv. alpina, Pv. anemones-dichotomae, Pv. anemones-ranunculoides, Pv. fusca, Pv. hellebori, and Pv. isopyrithalictroides) is introduced to accommodate the species parasitic on Ranunculaceae, which have so far often been referred to as Plasmopara pygmaea s.l. The lectotypification of Plasmopara with Pl. pygmaea, which has been accepted by most authors in recent times, is shown to have been superseded by typification with Pl. nivea. To ensure nomenclatural stability, the ambiguous Pl. nivea is neotypified, and Plasmopara is retained in its current use for the bulk of the species.
10.2307/25065445|The identity of the name Potamogeton fluitans Roth has for a long time been uncertain. An analysis of the history of the name and its use is presented and the identity of the extant material ascribed to Roth discussed. The name P. fluitans is neotypified with a specimen from a population of the hybrid P. lucens L.  P. natans L. recently studied morphologically, anatomically and electrophoretically. Nomenclature of the hybrid is summarized and lectotypes for a further four names designated. Distribution of the hybrid is described and a list of representative specimens given.
10.2307/25065473|The phylogeography of five flowering plant species (Cakile maritima, Eryngium maritimum, Salsola kali, Halimione portulacoides, Crithmum maritimum) widespread along the European coasts was investigated across their entire European range using AFLP evidence. Both similarities and dissimilarities were found. All species contain a distinct Black Sea/Aegean Sea cluster, and all except E. maritimum contain a distinct Adriatic Sea cluster or group of genetically very similar clusters. All species except Cr. maritimum contain a distinct Atlantic Ocean/North Sea/Baltic Sea cluster clearly separate from the Mediterranean material. In Ca. maritima a distinct Baltic Sea subcluster was found. In the western Mediterranean, two species groups can be recognized. Whereas in S. kali and E. maritimum material from this area falls into only one cluster or a group of genetically very similar clusters, it falls into two clusters or groups of clusters of either more Atlantic or more central Mediterranean similarity in Ca. maritima, H. portulacoides and Cr. maritimum. Similarities and dissimilarities in patterns found are discussed in terms of a combination of historical and extant abiotic and biotic factors. Thus, the distribution range of all species in the eastern Mediterranean area was not affected by Quaternary temperature changes, resulting in phylogeographic congruency here. The existence of distinct Black Sea/Aegean Sea and Adriatic Sea clusters or groups of clusters is the result of sea currents isolating these regions from each other. In the western Mediterranean basin the more cold-sensitive species (H. portulacoides, Cr. maritimum) but not the less cold-sensitive species (S. kali, E. maritimum) had to retreat from northern coasts. Re-colonization of these areas from two different directions is implied by their phylogeographic pattern. The existence of a distinct Gibraltar gap is explained in terms of extant sea currents. Comparison of phylogeographic patterns found with those observed in either marine or terrestrial organisms leads to the conclusion that marine dispersal is of overriding importance in these coastal plants.
10.2307/25065474|The Mediterranean Basin is expected to be more strongly affected by ongoing global climate change than most other regions of the earth. Given the magnitude of forecasted trends, there are great concerns for the particularly rich biodiversity found in the region. Studies of the consequences of past climate shifts on biodiversity represent one of the best sources of data to validate models of the ecological and evolutionary consequences of future changes. Here we review recent findings from palaeoecology, phylogeography and climate change research to (1) explore possible antecedents of the predicted climate warming in the younger geological history of the Mediterranean Basin, (2) assess how tree populations have reacted to them, and (3) evaluate the significance of the evolutionary heritage that is at stake. A major question of our retrospective approach is whether Quaternary tree extinctions took place primarily during glacial or during interglacial episodes. Available data are scanty and somewhat conflicting. In contrast, abundant phylogeographic evidence clearly indicates that the bulk of genetic diversity in European temperate tree species is almost invariably located in the southernmost part of their range. Long-term persistence of isolated populations have been common phenomena in the Mediterranean, to the point that the current genetic structure in this area probably often reflects population divergence that pre-dates the onset of the Mediterranean climate in the Pliocene. In particular, Tertiary migrations into the Mediterranean of tree taxa originating from Asia seem to have left their footprints in the current genetic structure in these slowly evolving organisms. Moreover, phylogeographic studies point to heterogeneous rates of molecular evolution across lineages that are inversely related with their stability. We conclude that relict tree populations in the Mediterranean Basin represent an evolutionary heritage of disproportionate significance for the conservation of European plant biodiversity.
10.2307/25065475|The Maritime and Ligurian Alps represent a regional hotspot of plant biodiversity found in the Mediterranean. Historical factors, complex geomorphology and habitat diversity may have played key roles to mould the biogeographical singularity of this area. This study represents the first regional phylogeographic attempt to better assess the complex evolutionary history of an endemic plant (Gentiana ligustica), which is found throughout this hotspot, across a large altitudinal and ecological gradient. Here, we examine how historical and topographical factors have affected the geographic structure of sequence variation at internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of ribosomal DNA. Sequence data revealed a fine-scale geographical structure of molecular variation, and the presence of contact areas between groups of populations differentiated by ITS ribotypes. A comparison between the sequence distribution and topography suggests that the genetic structure of G. ligustica is the result of isolation and drift. Combined phylogeographic, Pleistocene glaciation, topographic and geologic data suggest the presence of several genetically differentiated refugia, at the margins of the ice sheets in the southern part of the Maritime and Ligurian Alps during the last two glaciations (Riss and Wrm), as well as in some valleys and cliffs during the Wrm.
10.2307/25065476|Convolvulus is represented in Macaronesia by two endemic clades. The first (Clade I) has a predominantly western Mediterranean sister group whilst the second (Clade II) is nested within a predominantly eastern Mediterranean clade. The Relictual Series Hypothesis (RSH) predicts that degree of geographical disjunction between Macaronesian groups and their sister taxa is related to time available for continental extinction to occur and this would provide a possible explanation for the observed pattern in Convolvulus if Clade I is younger than Clade II. To test this hypothesis, mean relative divergence times for the two Macaronesian Convolvulus clades are estimated using a nrITS dataset. The results do not support the age-disjunction hypothesis and indicate that the mean divergence time for Clade I predates that of Clade II, although the difference between mean divergence times is small and the standard deviations are large. The inconsistency between this result and the RSH might be explained by the stochastic nature of evolution: with continental extinction events occurring during a similar time period, there may have been inadequate time for a clear spatio-temporal pattern to develop. An alternative explanation, termed the "Colonisation Window Hypothesis" (CWH), is also presented. This hypothesis emphasises island establishment rather than continental extinction as the prime determinant of spatio-temporal relationships of Macaronesian groups and predicts that opportunities for colonisation into Macaronesia has been temporally constrained to discrete waves of colonisation. Whilst the Convolvulus results are consistent with both RSH and CWH, a framework for establishing the ability of these two hypotheses to explain the spatial relationships of the Macaronesian endemic flora is presented.
10.2307/25065477|The Mediterranean Basin accounts for more than 10% of the world's vascular plant biodiversity in an area less than 1.5% the size of continental Earth. Forest tree taxa are also exceptionally diverse: more than 100 species have been recorded around the Mediterranean, but less than 30 species can be found in Temperate Europe. This amazing biodiversity was developed over millions of years due to the highly heterogeneous geology and climate of the Mediterranean. Did these factors also affect biodiversity within species, i.e., the genetic diversity of populations? Heterozygosity (the within-population gene diversity), and differentiation (the among-population spatial genetic structure), of neutral genes (isozymes) were used to measure within-species biodiversity in four conifer genera commonly found in the Mediterranean: Abies Mill., Cedrus Trew, Cupressus L., Pinus L. Their within-species biodiversity was significantly higher than that of other conifer species worldwide and did not correspond to expected values in terms of biogeography or levels of endemism. Gene diversity was significantly higher in the Eastern than in the Western Mediterranean Basin, and, surprisingly, was only mildly affected by human impact. A specific post-glacial recolonization model is proposed for the Mediterranean Basin, in which effective glacial refugia are more numerous, and genetic drift is less, than what is proposed for Europe. The within-species approach to biodiversity can help solve taxonomic questions, and when used as an indicator of evolutionary potentials, is an essential component of conservation strategies.
10.2307/25065478|Ranunculus s.l. shows a considerable species diversity and degree of endemism in the Mediterranean region and occurs with various life forms from the lowlands to the highest mountains. Based on a sampling from all continents, sequences of the ITS of nrDNA, the plastid matK, and the adjacent trnK regions were analysed using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference. Both separate and combined analyses of the two datasets yielded a large core clade of Ranunculus excluding Ficaria, Coptidium, and the extraeuropean genera Beckwithia, Callianthemoides, Halerpestes, and Peltocalathos. The Ceratocephala-Myosurus-clade is sister to the core Ranunculus in the plastid and the combined datasets on very long branches, thus supporting a classification of Ceratocephala and Myosurus as separate genera. Within Ranunculus s.s., eight well supported and highly consistent clades correspond either to widespread ecological groups (wetlands, high altitudes/latitudes) or to regional (mainly European) geographical groups. Alpine Mediterranean buttercups belong to orophytic clades, most species of which also occur in the European alpine system; others show widespread northern hemisphere distributions. Only one Mediterranean clade is restricted to the Iberian Peninsula and adjacent regions. Present distribution patterns and molecular data support a hypothesis of an origin of alpine buttercups from lowland ancestors of the same geographical region. At lower altitudes, the predominant life forms, i.e., therophytes and geophytes, evolved multiple times suggesting parallel adaptations to the Mediterranean climate. Geophytes differentiated into an eastern and western Mediterranean group, and are most closely related to the subalpine, non-monophyletic "R. montanus" group, thus supporting a hypothesis of a common lowland ancestor. Tentative estimates for divergence times of the major clades in Ranunculus s.l. were made based on an age calibration for the Ranunculus-Xanthorhiza-split, using matK sequences and penalized likelihood analyses. The results from this study suggest that the split of allied genera from Ranunculus s.s. occurred during the Eocene and Oligocene, with the core clade of Ranunculus being c. 24.0 Myr old. Diversification of Ranunculus s.s. into main ecological/geographical clades took place in the late Miocene, and speciation within the Mediterranean groups during the Pliocene and Pleistocene. Diversification of life forms at lower altitudes occurred mainly during or after the establishment of the Mediterranean climate. Island endemics of Macaronesia and Crete are probably rather young descendents of neighbouring geographical groups. Diversification of alpine groups took place at different geological times, but is in general correlated with periods of colder climate. The high diversity of buttercups is likely a consequence of the broad spectrum of different habitats in the Mediterranean region.
10.2307/25065479|The genus Centaurium (centauries) comprises ca. 27 annual species and subspecies primarily distributed in the Mediterranean basin. Phylogenetic relationships, inferred from sequences of both nrDNA (internal transcribed spacer, ITS) and cpDNA (trnL intron and trnL-F spacer) regions, confirm the monophyly of Centaurium and reveal the importance of polyploidy within the genus. In each ITS clade, diploid to hexaploid species of centauries occur. Furthermore, polyploidization is often associated with hybridization events, as suggested by the importance of additive polymorphic sites detected in the ITS region. Hence, reticulation appears to be the main cause of phylogenetic incongruence-and resulting systematic controversies-detected in the genus. Based on molecular and cytological evidence, the origin of several polyploid systems is discussed. Allopolyploidy, associated or not with introgression, appears to be the main evolutionary trend in Centaurium, and only a few autopolyploid taxa have been detected so far.
10.2307/25065480|A combination of dispersal-vicariance analysis (DIVA) and molecular clock dating of a calibrated, rate-smoothed maximum-likelihood tree based on sequence information from the internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal repeat (nrDNA ITS) was used to reconstruct the biogeographical history of the Circum-Mediterranean clade of Compositae-Anthemideae. The reconstructions suggest that the ancestor of this clade diverged from the basal African lineages in the late Early Miocene (18 Myr), presumably in conjunction with the collision of the African and Eurasian platform through the Arabian plate. Recurrent dispersal/vicariance events during the Middle and Late Miocene (16-11 Myr) both between the eastern and western Mediterranean regions and (in the latter region) between the northern and southern Peri-Tethys platforms caused the further diversification of the clade and may have been triggered by episodes of marine regression/transgression events on the Eurasian platform and in the area of the Strait of Gibraltar, respectively. The analyses further show that both the western part of the North African platform and the Anatolian region played a paramount role in the radiation of different subclades of the Circum-Mediterranean Anthemideae, leading to the present day genus-richness of the western subclade and to the species-richness in the large genera (Achillea, Anthemis, Cota, Tanacetum, Tripleurospermum) of the eastern subclade. Whereas in the present analyses these radiations are reconstructed as sympatric speciation events, they may actually correspond to allopatric speciation events on a finer geographical scale within the two main centres of diversification (NW Africa, Anatolia). The Messinian salinity crisis (5.96-5.33 Myr) and the following re-inundation of the Mediterranean basin (Early Pliocene) triggered dispersal/vicariance events observable today on the level of species or species groups, as did the climatic changes during the Pleistocene.
10.2307/25065481|A striking feature of the Mediterranean flora concerns the high rates of narrow endemism within many regions. The prevailing paradigm for the evolution of such endemism relies on an important role of geographic isolation and allopatric speciation. Until recently there has been little work on the precise ecological differences among endemic plants and their congeners in the Mediterranean region and the potential role of ecological specialisation in isolation and speciation. This paper has two objectives. First, we evaluate general ecological differences among endemic and widespread congeners in the flora of the western Mediterranean. The results and review of the literature attest to consistent patterns of ecological differentiation among endemic species and their more widespread congeners. Second, we present results of a detailed study of morphological, molecular and ecological differentiation in a group of spring-flowering Mediterranean Cyclamen species. This study illustrates how differentiation in geographically peripheral and ecologically marginal populations may contribute to the diversification of endemic species whose contemporary distributions are disjunct from con-generic species.
10.2307/25065482|The extraordinary floral diversity in orchids reflects the importance of orchid-pollinator associations in orchid evolution, and pollination biology is regarded as a driving force in orchid diversification and speciation. As a consequence, a prominent role has been attributed to the specificity of orchid-pollinator associations and to pollinator mediated pre-mating barriers for maintaining reproductive isolation among orchid species. Changes in floral morphology, coloration or odor may lead to the attraction of different pollinators and to the occupation of different ethological niches. Although this concept is appealing, it does not find strong support in Mediterranean orchids, subtribe Orchidinae, where phylogenetic studies have revealed that speciation is not strictly associated with shifts in pollination biology and where numerous literature reports described the wide occurrence of hybridization. Most Mediterranean orchids are food-deceptive, by generally mimicking rewarding plants, and the low specificity of this pollination strategy is the main cause of the observed hybridization. Genetic analyses of hybrid zones have revealed that most hybrid individuals were first generation hybrids. These findings, together with the absence of polyploid chromosome numbers, suggest that hybridization is of limited importance as basis for speciation in Mediterranean orchids. However, strong karyotype differences between closely related species that share pollinators, suggest that chromosomal changes play a prominent role in reducing hybrid fitness and maintaining reproductive isolation among sympatric Mediterranean orchid species.
10.2307/25065483|Systematic and evolutionary relationships within the diploid Western Mediterranean Phlomis crinita/lychnitis complex remain controversial apparently due to hybridization and introgression. This study examines patterns of sequence variation in the nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS region) and three non-coding plastid DNA regions (trnH-psbA, trnT-trnL and atpB-rbcL) in this complex in an aim to clarify whether hybridization, introgression or lineage sorting resulting from recent diversification is mainly responsible for poorly understood relationships. Information recovered from nuclear and chloroplast markers was found to be strongly incongruent. Phylogenetic analysis of inferred nuclear ITS ribotypes is consistent with previous morphometric and taxonomic results in distinguishing two sister lineages, P. crinita s.l. and P. lychnitis. In addition, the high number of additive polymorphisms detected in ITS sequences suggests the sharing of ancestral variability and local patterns of gene flow within the complex. In contrast, the pattern of chloroplast haplotype variation is geographic rather than taxonomic, which might be caused by low mutation rates combined with frequent instances of interspecific hybridization. To integrate the apparently discordant plastid and nuclear evidence, we suggest that both lineage sorting and horizontal transfer have been involved. Even though pinpointing cases due to either phenomenon is difficult, the available data provide evidence of two sister lineages where hybridization events can be identified despite the inheritance of ancestral polymorphisms.
10.2307/25065484|The impact of molecular systematics, especially DNA sequences, on plant taxonomy and biosystematics has been fundamental and era-splitting. It has led to reactions by researchers ranging from advocating that it is now the only kind of research worth pursuing to considering molecular data as merely another body of evidence to be utilised equally with all the others. Can DNA "lie"? What reasons might there be to question the veracity of what it appears to tell us about plant evolution? This paper is an attempted discussion on the extent to which we can afford to rely solely upon DNA sequences to unravel the evolution of and relationships between plants, and on the principles underlying our utilisation of DNA data in making taxonomic decisions. The main topics visited are: interpretation of chloroplast DNA and rDNA ITS sequences in polyploids in the light of maternal inheritance and concerted evolution; importance of "traditional" characters such as crossability and chromosomal homology as revealed by DNA evidence; desirability of insisting on a monophyletic classification; effects of sample-size on phylogenetic analysis; and the suitability for evolutionary studies of a molecule composed of only four different elements in terms of likely levels of homoplasy. Special reference is made to recent phylogenetic analyses of festucoid grasses, especially the genus Vulpia, where it is proposed that the obvious "misplacement" of certain polyploid species can actually be used to infer their parentage.
10.2307/25065485|The ascomycete genera Cryphonectria and Endothia are closely related members of Diaporthales. Recent DNA sequence comparisons have shown that isolates from Elaeocarpus spp. in New Zealand, previously identified as Cryphonectria radicalis and Cryphonectria gyrosa, represent a phylogenetic group distinct from those including other species of Cryphonectria and Endothia. Cryphonectria gyrosa applies to a species that occurs on Elaeocarpus glandulifer in Sri Lanka, the same host genus but a different species from which the New Zealand collections were made. The aim of this study was to provide a name for the fungi residing in the phylogenetic group from New Zealand. Morphological characters that define these fungi include superficial conical conidiomata, conidia of variable size, and ascospores with one to three septa. These characteristics are not found in other species of Cryphonectria. We also recognise a second species in the group from New Zealand that has distinctly larger ascospores. Herbarium specimens of C. gyrosa exhibit the same primary characteristics as the specimens from New Zealand and C. gyrosa is regarded as conspecific with one of the species in the New Zealand collections. A new genus, Amphilogia, is described for the collections of C. gyrosa from Sri Lanka and New Zealand, which also contains the second species from New Zealand, Amphilogia major sp. nov.
10.2307/25065486|Variation of 89 multistate morphological characters in 44 species of Vicia subgen. Cracca was investigated with cladistic and phenetic methods using Lathyrus sylvestris and Pisum elatius as outgroups. The subgenus appears monophyletic; the Ervum group is supported as a section. Sections Vicilla and Cassubicae appear monophyletic when V. amoena is moved to section Cassubicae. Placement of V. biennis in a separate section is supported, sections Variegatae and Panduratae are nested in section Cracca, and section Pedunculatae is not supported as monophyletic. Use of different outgroups results in slightly different substructures for sect. Cracca.
10.2307/25065490|Interactive keys are useful multiple-entry identification tools for science. A web-based program called ActKey (URL: http://flora.huh.harvard.edu:8080/actkey/) was developed to enable online, ready-access to interactive identification keys. A number of keys have been imported into a centralized, relational database, and are now available for the floras of China, North America, Madagascar, Borneo, and the world. Plants from more than 40 of the largest genera of China can be identified using ActKey. Datasets containing taxa and their characters can be imported from a variety of database formats and updated by taxonomic specialists and editors.
10.2307/25065491|The Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC) sets a series of ambitious targets for 2010 to stem the loss of plant diversity. Target 2 calls for a preliminary assessment of the conservation status of all known plant species, at national, regional and international levels, but with less than 3% of global diversity assessed to date, the process must be greatly accelerated. This can best be done by mobilizing plant taxonomists to identify species that are threatened (or potentially threatened) using available distribution data from herbaria and other sources, and by including preliminary IUCN Red List assessments in all their taxonomic works. Emphasis should be placed on rare taxa with restricted ranges, which are the most likely to be at risk. Sufficient data are available for preliminary assessment of nearly all species, thereby limiting the number that must be relegated to "data deficient" status (DD). The taxonomic community can play a unique role in fulfilling the GSPC goals, but we must act quickly.
10.2307/25065492|As part of the activities of the Southern African Botanical Diversity Network (SABONET), funds were made available by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) to compile plant Red Data Lists for the ten participating countries. Analysis of costs involved in terms of human and financial resources to perform conservation assessments of threatened plants revealed interesting trends, especially cost savings due to sound co-ordination followed by stakeholder participation and data collection. Data dissemination proved the most expensive. Data collection did not include costs involved in gathering species information, because these contributions were voluntary and cost-free. SABONET has demonstrated that with sound management and co-ordination, and selective regional participatory consultation and peer review, it is possible to assess conservation status of threatened plants at around $US 18/taxon and produce a complete product at $US 40/taxon. Cost-effective expenditure for generating conservation-oriented information is often overlooked in donor-funded projects. This article presents a project case study of how a low financial input can lead to high returns (useful information and skills that can improve decisions about conservation).
10.2307/25065494|A taxonomic and nomenclatural history of Codriophorus fascicularis (Hedw.) Bednarek-Ochyra & Ochyra ( Trichostomum fasciculare Hedw.; Racomitrium fasciculare (Hedw.) Brid.) is presented. In the absence of original material of this species in the Hedwig herbarium at Geneva, figure 28 on table 47 in the Dillenian Historia Muscorum of 1741 is selected as lectotype and a corresponding specimen preserved in his personal herbarium at Oxford is chosen as epitype of this species name. The epitype specimen is described and illustrated, and it represents the typical morphophase of the taxon characterized by the presence of short tuft-like horizontal lateral branchlets. The nomenclatural status of Bryum lutescens Dicks. ( Trichostomum lutescens (Dicks.) P. Beauv.) and Racomitrium virescens Lindb. is briefly discussed, and these names are considered to be legitimate. Both names are lectotypified and their synonymy with Codriophorus fascicularis is, thereby, confirmed.
10.2307/25065495|Confusion about the dates of publication for Ipomoea muricata (L.) Jacq. and I. muricata Cav. has resulted in both names being set aside in favour of later names proposed for these two distinct taxa. Investigation of the publication date for Jacquin's Plantae Rariorum Horti Caesari Schoenbrunnensis clarifies the nomenclature for these two tropical morning glories. Ipomoea muricata (L.) Jacq. is the earlier name, and it is herein reinstated for the plant recently called I. turbinata Lagasca by some authors. Ipomoea capillacea (Kunth) G. Don is the correct name for I. muricata Cav.
10.2307/25065496|The main pharmacopoeias cite the roots of Cephaelis ipecacuanha (Brot.) A.Rich. ( Callicocca ipecacuanha Brot.) and Cephaelis acuminata H.Karst. as the source of the crude drug ipecac. However, C. acuminata does not occur in botanical literature, except in connection with the original description, and this falls entirely within the variation of the widespread and variable Cephaelis ipecacuanha. Callicocca ipecacuanha was described from Brazil, but no type specimen has been found and the name is here lectotypified with an illustration from the protologue. For Cephaelis acuminata, described from Colombia, no original material is extant, and a recent specimen from Colombia is here selected to serve as neotype. In the most recent revision of the group the name Carapichea ipecacuanha (Brot.) L. Andersson is used for the species.
10.2307/25065497|Five genera of Marantaceae with a total of 14 species occur in Thailand. Full nomenclatural citations are provided with notes on typification, synonyms and distribution of all taxa. One generic and eleven species names are lectotypified; one species name is neotypified; twenty-two new synonymisations are reported; the new combination Stachyphrynium repens (Krn.) Suksathan & Borchs. is also made. Important taxonomic characters for species delimitation and their variation within and between taxa are discussed where new synonymy is included.
10.2307/25065498|The Jurassic dinoflagellate cyst genus Fosteria Riding & Helby 2001 is a later (junior) homonym of Fosteria Molseed 1968, a genus of the Iridaceae. The generic name Fostericysta is proposed here to replace Fosteria Riding & Helby 2001.
10.2307/25065525|DNA sequences were generated for matK and ITS for 68 and 103 samples of Cornus to reconstruct a species level phylogeny of the genus. The results support the monophyly of most subgenera, except subg. Kraniopsis and subg. Cornus. Subgenus Kraniopsis was suggested to exclude C. peruviana from South America and subg. Afrocrania and subg. Sinocornus were nested within subg. Cornus. Four major clades corresponding to groups also recognizable by morphological differences were revealed: the big-bracted dogwoods (BB) including subg. Cynoxylon, subg. Syncarpea, and subg. Discocrania, the dwarf dogwoods (DW) including subg. Arctocrania, the cornelian cherries (CC) including subg. Cornus, subg. Sinocornus, and subg. Afrocrania, and the blue- or white-fruited dogwoods (BW) including subg. Kraniopsis, subg. Mesomora, and subg. Yinquania. This finding is consistent with previous studies with more limited sampling. The single South American species C. peruviana was found to be sister to the Asian C. oblonga of subg. Yinquania, adding a fourth intercontinental disjunction in the genus that was previously unknown. Species relationships within the subgenera were clearly resolved except for the relatively large subg. Syncarpea and subg. Kraniopsis. Phylogenetic analyses of total evidence combining morphology, matK, ITS, and previously published rbcL and 26S rDNA sequences resolved the relationships among subgenera as (BW(CC(BB,DW))). Biogeographic analyses using DIVA with or without fossils resulted in different inferences of biogeographic history of the genus, indicating the importance of fossil data in biogeographic analyses. The phylogeny based on the total evidence tree including fossils supports an origin and early Tertiary diversification of Cornus in Europe and multiple trans-Atlantic migrations between Europe and North America by the early Tertiary. It also supports that distribution of the few species in the southern hemisphere was not ancestral, but a result of migration from the north. This evidence rejects a previous hypothesis of a southern hemispheric origin of the genus.
10.2307/25065526|Taiwan and Ryukyus constitute an archipelago lying on the western rim of the Pacific Ocean. In contrast to volcanic islands that often arise sequentially, these continental islands emerged almost simultaneously as the Luzon arc collided with the Eurasian margin some 9 million years ago (Mya). Taiwan and Ryukyus attained their modern features and their current flora and fauna from the adjacent mainland and from tropical Asia only 5-6 Mya. Quaternary glaciation led to a drop in sea level of the South China Sea and a land bridge that connected the Taiwan-Ryukyu Archipelago to the mainland, which allowed plants and animals to migrate across what was previously ocean. These islands provided refugia for northern species that migrated south during glacial periods, as indicated by unanticipated high levels of genetic diversity in island populations of plants like Cunninghamia and Pinus. For most insect-pollinated species, allozymes and nuclear DNA markers indicate significant genetic differentiation between populations and between geographical regions of the archipelago. In contrast, organelle based DNA markers suggest a migrant-pool model, where colonists are recruited from a random sample of source populations. Consistent with this model, low elevation species have high genetic heterogeneity within populations and low levels of genetic differentiation between populations. In contrast, colonization of alpine species appeared to follow a phalanx model due to the limited availability of high elevation habitats. Genetic differentiation was detected between fragmented populations of the alpine species. A scenario of stepwise colonization from the mainland to near and then distant islands remains to be tested, although several studies indicate no such pattern. These conflicting results challenge the ability to define clear conservation criteria for the rare plant species of the archipelago.
10.2307/25065527|A preliminary synthesis of the geographic distribution patterns of intraspecific cpDNA variations in Japanese alpine plants is presented by studying five species, namely, Pedicularis chamissonis, Primula cuneifolia, Loiseleuria procumbens, Cardamine nipponica, and Anemone narcissiflora. Nucleotide sequences of the non-coding regions of cpDNA recognized multiple cpDNA haplotypes in these species. Phylogenetic analyses of these haplotypes suggest two or three major cpDNA clades; each clade has a clearly disjunct distribution pattern in the northern parts of Japan, and in the central parts of Japan. The southernmost clades endemic to central Honshu in Japan were found in all the species (Central Honshu clade). We estimate that the major clades of Pedicularis chamissonis and Primula cuneifolia separated from a common ancestor before the last glacial period (>0.6 and 0.47 million years ago, respectively). We speculate that the common distribution patterns of the cpDNA clades observed in central Honshu were formed by dynamic climatic changes (e.g., glacial events in the Pleistocene) and that the alpine regions of central Honshu acted as refugia for alpine plants during warm interglacial periods.
10.2307/25065528|The phylogeography of Japanese conifers studied using polymorphic allozyme and organelle (chloroplast and mitochondrial) DNA markers is reviewed. Three Abies species showed a clear geographical cline based on mtDNA polymorphisms. Allozyme markers revealed a clear genetic cline in A. mariesii, with no mtDNA polymorphism. Refugia of these species during the last glaciation were probably located along the southwestern Pacific side of Japan. Based on allozyme analysis, Pinus pumila may have migrated from Siberia southward from Hokkaido to higher mountains in central Japan. Mitochondrial DNA polymorphisms clearly differentiated the pentaphylla and parviflora varieties of Pinus parviflora and suggest that refugia of the latter species were located south of the central mountains of Chubu district during the last glaciation. Current populations in the Chubu highlands, Tohoku, and Hokkaido presumably became established by colonization from these refugia. Phylogeographic analysis of Cryptomeria japonica using allozymes and DNA markers did not reveal distinct patterns. However, microsatellite analysis revealed highest allelic diversity in putative refugia of the last glaciation. Allozyme analysis of Chamaecyparis obtusa revealed a clear cline. Recently, substantial numbers of loci based on expressed sequence tags for population and genome mapping were developed. Cryptomeria japonica and Chamaecyparis obtusa belong to different families, but molecular phylogeny based on chloroplast sequence data revealed that they are closely related and that sequence tag site markers of C. japonica are highly applicable to C. obtusa. Using such markers, researchers have attempted to clarify the genetic structure of the two species. This paper also discusses the most successful approaches (to date) for elucidating the genetic structure of the above-mentioned species and other phylogeographic issues related to Japanese conifers.
10.2307/25065529|Chenopodiaceae subfam. Betoideae is distributed in both western Eurasia (four genera) and western North America (one genus). To understand the origin of this disjunction, the phylogeny of the subfamily was reconstructed and dated using ndhF, matK/trnK, trnL-trnF spacer, and ITS sequence variation, penalized likelihood and Langley-Fitch, and calibration with three different fossils. Maximum Parsimony and Maximum Likelihood analyses of the molecular data show that Betoideae are monophyletic, but that relationships of the Himalayan Acroglochin, traditionally included in Betoideae because of the shared possession of a circumscissile capsule, are uncertain. Among the betoidean genera, Beta (excl. sect. Procumbentes) is sister to a clade of Hablitzia, Patellifolia (= Beta sect. Procumbentes), Oreobliton, and Aphanisma. Apart from the strongly supported sister group relationship between the North African Oreobliton and the Californian Aphanisma interrelationships among these four genera are not unambiguously resolved. The crown group age of Betoideae was estimated to 38.4-27.5 my using different DNA sequences, and the age of the Oreobliton/Aphanisma split to 15.4-8.1 my. Considering all evidence available, we conclude that the western Eurasian-western North American disjunction of Oreobliton/Aphanisma is more likely to have resulted from the fragmentation of a Beringian than a North Atlantic ancestral range. Irrespective of the geographical location of this ancestral range we postulate that the evolution into dry habitats of Oreobliton and Aphanisma took place in parallel in western Eurasia and western North America. Evidence for this may be the very different life form and habitat of the two genera, of which Oreobliton is a subshrub of rocky ground at montane altitude, and Aphanisma an annual from coastal habitats. Hablitzia, a perennial vine of deciduous forests in the Caucasus area, is sister to Patellifolia/Oreobliton/Aphanisma in the ndhF and ITS data sets. The habitat requirements of Hablitzia may be similar to those of the ancestor of the subfamily. Comparing the age of the Oreobliton/Aphanisma disjunction with ages estimated for East Asian-eastern North American disjunctions, we conclude that in many cases these two types of disjunction represent different ecological trajectories of essentially the same historical phenomenon.
10.2307/25065530|With as many as 1000 included species, Syzygium s.l. (including Syzygium and segregate genera such as Acmena, Acmenosperma, Cleistocalyx, Piliocalyx, and Waterhousea) comprises one of the major lineages within Myrtaceae, and is an important component of the Old-World tropical rainforest flora. As with other large genera, high species richness, an extensive distribution and relative homogeneity in morphology have hindered attempts to divide Syzygium s.l. Here, we investigate higher level relationships within the group, using parsimony and Bayesian analyses of cpDNA sequences from the matK and ndhF genes and the rpl16 intron, generated for a total of 87 species from the Syzygium group and eight outgroup taxa. Within the ingroup, four major well supported clades are found, which form a basal polytomy along with S. wesa and monotypic Anetholea. Generally, the molecular data provide little support for traditional divisions of Syzygium s.l., and the recognition of segregate groups such as Acmena, Acmenosperma, Cleistocalyx, Piliocalyx and Waterhousea. While homoplasy amongst morphological characters has misled attempts to divide the group, detailed and critical assessments of placental, ovular and seed morphology may provide novel insights into evolutionary relationships, and are an important future step in the development of a sound higher level taxonomy for Syzygium s.l.
10.2307/25065531|Relationships of the small austral genus Abrotanella are uncertain. It was previously included in the Anthemideae or more recently in the Senecioneae. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis of 39 accessions that included most species of Abrotanella and putative relatives including Blennosperma, Crocidium and Ischnea. These four genera have been considered to form subtribe Blennospermatinae. Our results suggest that the Blennospermatinae are polyphyletic; Blennosperma, Crocidium and Ischnea form a well-supported clade nested within the Senecioneae, while Abrotanella forms another well-supported clade that is distinct from these genera and its sister is not resolved. Molecular dating of Abrotanella suggests that the lineage initially diverged during the early Miocene. Secondary species radiations in Australasia and in southern South America that occurred 3 million years ago undoubtedly reflect long-distance dispersal, colonization and speciation. Both the ITS region and the 5' trnK/matK chloroplast DNA intron gave similar divergence estimates. The estimates were also robust to changes in the tree topology and to the different methods used to calculate divergence times.
10.2307/25065532|Although originally ascribed to the genus Gymnadenia R. Br. (Orchidinae: Orchidaceae), the Balkan endemic orchid G. frivaldii Hampe ex Griseb. has since been more frequently assigned to Pseudorchis Sguier (syn. Leucorchis E. Mey., Bicchia Parl.). Molecular phylogenetic analysis using the ITS region of rDNA reveals a large disparity between the two genera and demonstrates that frivaldii is embedded well within Gymnadenia s.s. Macromorphological and SEM studies further elucidate the floral and vegetative similarities between G. frivaldii and Pseudorchis, notably the heterochronically reduced gynostemium and small, short-spurred labellum; these similarities represent convergent evolutionary transitions, whereas other characters such as contrasting stigma and tuber morphologies provide stronger phylogenetic signals. The sequence-based phylogeny suggests that G. frivaldii represents one of three cases of independent paedomorphic floral reduction inferred in the genus; simplification has been more severe than in G. odoratissima but less severe than in the closely related Gymnadenia subgenus Nigritella. Alternatively, an effectively instantaneous evolutionary origin through hybridisation with a (most likely diploid) species of subgenus Nigritella remains possible. Reports of rare hybridisation between G. frivaldii and members of subgenus Nigritella are acceptably well documented, whereas reports of hybridisation with several other more phylogenetically distant orchid species (including the often sympatric Pseudorchis albida) are considered less secure.
10.2307/25065533|According to analyses of plastid DNA, New World Asclepiadoideae (Apocynaceae) fall into four clades; most species, however, are included in just one clade endemic to the New World that comprises Metastelmatinae, Oxypetalinae and Gonolobinae (the MOG clade). Looking for better support and resolution inside the MOG core group, we sequenced the nuclear ribosomal DNA region ITS and increased the number of plastid regions (trnS-G and matK) sequenced. Because of high levels of intra-individual polymorphisms and complex alignment among subtribes, ITS could not be used at the subtribal level. According to combined analysis of the plastid regions, Blepharodon lineare and Funastrum clausum are confirmed as sister group to the rest of Metastelmatinae and Oxypetalinae, respectively. The analysis indicates that Ditassa is polyphyletic. A highly supported clade composed of shrubby species with minute leaves that were traditionally classified in Ditassa comes out as sister to the rest of the subtribe apart from B. lineare. These data clearly support the recognition of a new genus in Metastelmatinae.
10.2307/25065534|The chloroplast gene matK and the nuclear internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) were used to explore taxonomic placement of and phylogeny within Calceolaria and related genera of Calceolarieae (= Calceolariaceae), a group traditionally referred to the polyphyletic Scrophulariaceae. Calceolarieae appear as a strongly supported monophyletic group and receive moderate support as the sister group of the family Gesneriaceae. The monotypic genus Porodittia is deeply nested inside Calceolaria and is reduced to synonymy under the latter genus. The phylogenetic trees retrieved for Calceolaria reveal that many presently recognised sections are polyphyletic. They also suggest that temperate species have retained the most ancestral character states in the genus. The phylogeny of Calceolaria features a number of well supported clades, which are difficult to characterize morphologically. A renewed interpretation of morphological characters diagnosing natural groups within Calceolaria is called for. The role of the Huancabamba Deflection as an important factor in the biogeography of Calceolaria is strongly alluded by the inferred phylogeny.
10.2307/25065535|Based on results of recent phylogenetic studies, two new sections of Festuca L. (F. sect. Lojaconoa, F. sect. Dimorphae) are described from the Euromediterranean region. Festuca sect. Lojaconoa is typified by Festuca coerulescens and also includes F. patula. Festuca sect. Dimorphae is typified by F. dimorpha and also includes F. laxa and F. pseudolaxa. Differentiation of these groups from other tax, traditionally considered related [i.e., Festuca sect. Subbulbosae Nyman ex Hack. and F. sect. Amphigenes (Janka) Tzvel.], is discussed. Festuca sect. Subbulbosae is lectotypified. The correct names of the species hitherto known as Festuca carpatica F. Dietr. and F. triflora Desf. are F. pseudolaxa Schur and F. patula Desf., respectively.
10.2307/25065536|The recognition of two new Malagasy species of Grammitidaceae, Zygophlebia goodmanii and Z. anjanaharibensis, puts into question some morphological and anatomical features separating the related genera Zygophlebia and Ceradenia, which until now were mainly defined based on neotropical taxa. The two new species share with Zygophlebia and Ceradenia subgen. Filicipecten a rhizome with dorsiventral symmetry and an amphiphloic siphonostele, well-differentiated phyllopodia, a deeply pinnatifid lamina without hydathodes at the tips of veins, and glandular receptacular paraphyses. Because of the non-waxy translucent exudates of their paraphyses, the two new taxa are placed in the genus Zygophlebia, in spite of their mostly free leaf veins. Peculiar vascular gaps, unrelated to phyllopodial insertions and distinctive of Zygophlebia, are found in the rhizome stele of Z. goodmanii. The lack of setiform hairs and the distal sori location in Z. anjanaharibensis do not allow for linking this species to any of the three groups previously described by Bishop in Zygophlebia.
10.2307/25065537|Recent cladistic analysis of multiple molecular data from chloroplast and nuclear genomes as well as morphological data have indicated that a reclassification of the family Costaceae is necessary in order to appropriately reflect phylogenetic relationships. The previously described genera Tapeinochilos, Monocostus, and Dimerocostus are all upheld in the new classification. Monocostus and Dimerocostus are found to be sister taxa. The large pantropical genus Costus is found to be polyphyletic and is thus divided into four genera, three of which are new (Cheilocostus, Chamaecostus, Paracostus). Costus has now a more concise generic concept including morphological synapomorphies previously absent due to the polymorphic nature of the prior non-monophyletic assemblage. Of the three new genera, one (Paracostus) was previously recognized as a subgenus of Costus. Cheilocostus comprises several Asian taxa and is sister to Tapeinochilos, whereas Chamaecostus comprises entirely neotropical taxa and is sister to a neotropical Monocostus + Dimerocostus clade. A reevaluation of the traditional taxonomy indicates that floral characters and pollination syndromes commonly used to identify groups exhibit homoplasy when analyzed in a cladistic framework and are thus unreliable as taxonomic indicators.
10.2307/25065538|The presence of Keteleeria in the Miocene of eastern China is confirmed by the discovery of a cone, winged seeds, and leafy shoots. These are described and compared with other fossil and recent representatives. The best match was with K. rujadana, a K. fortunei-like fossil from the Oligocene of Oregon, U.S.A. The presence of similar, if not identical taxa, on both sides of the Pacific indicates that in the Mid-Tertiary exchange between East Asia and North America via the Beringian land-bridge was still possible. With global cooling in the Tertiary, this thermophilic conifer became scarce. Its present restricted distribution dates from the Quaternary.
10.2307/25065539|As a contribution to establish taxonomic identification methods using DNA sequence data, we evaluate to which extent the present set-up of the nucleotide databases (NCBI, EBI, GenomeNet) allows to use them for reliable routine plant identification applying the implemented sequence similarity and homology search tools. We screened newly determined ITS 1 sequences from Asteraceae (tribes Lactuceae, Anthemideae) against the molecular nucleotide databases where sequences from that exact species, from other species of the same genus, or only from other genera of the same family had already been published. With the present set up of the BLAST algorithms [MEGABLAST, BLASTN] 100% correct family, 99% correct tribe, and 98% precise genus affiliation could be achieved in Lactuceae representatives and 100% correct family, 100% correct tribe, and 95% precise genus affiliation in Anthemideae. Correct species detection varied between 86% accuracy for Lactuceae and 91% in Anthemideae. Necessary optimization criteria are proposed as well as further requirements for a standardized molecular identification system.
10.2307/25065540|Online floras provide research botanists with the opportunity to work on floristic treatments dynamically, and enable users to browse and search these treatments. A web-based program called eFloras (URL: http://www.efloras.org/) was developed to enable access to online "electronic" floras. Through a web interface to the data, users can browse online floristic treatments by volume, family, and genus, and can search by name, distributional data, and text. With the use of web forms, editors and authors with permissions can correct and update the data.
10.2307/25065541|The application of the generic name Fragilaria has remained uncertain because the identity of the lectotype, Conferva pectinalis O. F. Mll., is unknown. Traditionally Fragilaria capucina Desm. has been considered a synonym of F. pectinalis, although this synonymy has not been confirmed. Application of the generic name Fragilaria can best be fixed by designating an epitype for C. pectinalis that fits the current circumscription of the genus (sensu Williams & Round). As epitype for C. pectinalis, we designate a specimen that Dillwyn thought to be representative of that species. We also examined the type material of F. capucina. Specimens from this material have a rimoportula at each pole and open girdle bands. Although the first character was not part of the revised definition proposed by Williams & Round, F. capucina can be placed in Fragilaria on account of the structure of its striae and the general appearance of the basal siliceous layer. Fragilaria capucina is, however, clearly not a synonym of F. pectinalis.
10.2307/25065542|The genus Fragilaria Lyngb. 1819 originally comprised eight species of filamentous diatoms, six of which were marine whereas two were freshwater. Subsequently, two of the eight species have been referred to Melosira C. Agardh 1824 (nom. cons.), two to Grammatophora Ehrenb. 1840, and one each to Diatoma Bory 1824 (nom. cons.) and Striatella C. Agardh 1832. Of the remaining species, Fragilaria pectinalis (O. F. Mll.) Lyngb. (Conferva pectinalis O. F. Mll.), from fresh water, was designated lectotype by Boyer in 1927. The last species, F. striatula Lyngb., from marine habitats, can be accommodated by Grammonema C. Agardh 1832. Because authentic material of Conferva pectinalis has not been found and Mller's published figures are not identifiable, the application of that name, and hence the application of the generic name Fragilaria, has remained uncertain. Fragilaria capucina Desm., which has been assumed to include the material in Lyngbye's hand, has served as a de facto lectotype. However, current studies by Tuji & Williams (2006) reveal that the type of F. capucina is not conspecific with the species to which that name has traditionally been applied. They therefore have proposed an epitype for C. pectinalis that will ensure the continued application of the generic name Fragilaria in the present-day sense.
10.2307/25065543|Teodor Hedlund was a Swedish botanist who published nearly 50 new names or combinations in Sorbus L. (Rosaceae). Lectotypes are designated for Sorbus arranensis Hedlund, S. minima (Ley) Hedlund, S. quercifolia Hedlund and S. subsimilis Hedlund. The lectotypification of S. anglica Hedlund by A. J. Wilmott is rejected and a new lectotype selected. Notes are given on typification of S. rupicola (Syme) Hedlund. "Sorbus globulifera Hedlund ex Riddelsdell" is not validly published and the material it is based on is part of the variation in S. aria (L.) Crantz.
10.2307/25065544|Lectotypes, neotypes and epitypes are designated by fifteen specialists for 99 Linnaean plant names belonging to the family Apiaceae (Umbelliferae). These newly proposed types support the current usage of the names concerned. Earlier but ineffective or supersedable type statements are discussed where appropriate.
10.2307/25065547|This note documents the events and conduct that led to the acceptance of Report 55 of the Permanent Committee for Spermatophyta concerning the conservation of Acacia Mill. with a new type. The procedures followed by the Nomenclature Section of the
10.2307/25065577|Relationships of genera traditionally referred to the subfamily Hydrocotyloideae (Apiaceae), with emphasis on Azorella, were estimated using sequence variation in the markers matK, rbcL, and rps16. The analyses were based on a combined dataset comprising 66 taxa represented by 134 sequences (29 matK, 40 rbcL, and 65 rps16) as well as partial datasets constructed from individual markers and combinations of them. The results confirm previous observations that the hydrocotyloids are an unnatural assemblage of taxa from at least four different groups, of which one belongs to Araliaceae and the remaining ones to Apiaceae. The recently recognized subfamilies Mackinlayoideae and Azorelloideae are supported, with the possible exclusion of Platysace from the former and the addition of Asteriscium, Diposis, Domeykoa, Drusa, Homalocarpus, Laretia, Oschatzia, and Pozoa to the latter. Within Azorelloideae, the Azorella, Bowlesia, and Asteriscium clades are identified, although relationships among them are obscure. The genus Azorella occurs in two subclades that also include other genera, and is obviously paraphyletic as presently conceived. The Azorella sections Cirrhosae and Ciliatae are probably also paraphyletic.
10.2307/25065578|The evolutionary distinctiveness and phylogenetic position of Marantaceae within the Zingiberales is strongly supported, yet relatively little phylogenetic research has been conducted on members of Marantaceae. Phylogenetic analyses of plastid DNA sequence data (matK and 3' intergenic spacer region, and the trnL-F intergenic spacer region) for 80 ingroup taxa representing 27 genera were conducted under parsimony criteria. Results identify five major clades and support significant realignments in tribal and "group" circumscriptions. Four non-monophyletic genera, Calathea, Marantochloa, Phrynium, and Schumannianthus are identified. Although significant work remains to identify relationships of the major lineages within Marantaceae and to redefine several problematic genera, we propose a working classification that better reflects the inferred evolutionary history of the family.
10.2307/25065579|Arenaria sect. Plinthine is an easily distinguishable morphologically cohesive group encompassing 14 species and five additional subspecies. To explore phylogenetic relationships and search for phylogeographic patterns in a group that is restricted to the western Mediterranean, independent and combined analyses of four datasets (morphological characters and sequences from nuclear and plastid DNA: nrITS, trnT-trnL, trnL-trnF) were conducted using Maximum Parsimony, Neighbour-Joining, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference. Monophyly of the section is supported by the data, the ITS sequences show full agreement with taxonomy for one third of the taxa, and the high number of trnL-F haplotypes found in SE Spain (7 of 11) is consistent with the fact that this region is one of the hotspots of biodiversity in the Mediterranean. However, a number of less easily interpretable results have been obtained, despite considerable ITS variation (43 parsimony informative characters within the ingroup) and a reasonable intraspecific sampling for this marker. These results are: low resolution at deep nodes of the ingroup, partial discordance between taxonomy and ITS sequences particularly for widespread taxa, and lack of congruence not only between the topologies of the plastid and nuclear trees but also between the two plastid trees. It is proposed that a combination of factors (rampant aneuploidy, polyploidy, hybridization, lineage sorting, and concerted evolution of ITS sequences) are responsible for the incongruent but not totally unexpected results.
10.2307/25065580|Episcieae is the most diverse tribe of Gesneriaceae, with 22 genera and over 700 species, or roughly 21% of all Gesneriaceae. The tribe is restricted to the Neotropics and is characterized by axillary flowers derived from a pair-flowered cyme inflorescence by reduction, a three-trace trilacunar node with split lateral bundles, superior ovaries, and with most members having a haploid chromosome number of n = 9 [n = 8 in Codonanthe and Nematanthus]. Most traditionally recognized genera in Episcieae are either known to be non-monophyletic or have not been represented adequately in phylogenetic analyses to test their monophyly. This paper presents phylogenetic analyses utilizing two molecular [the internal transcribed spacer region of 18S-26S nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS) and the trnH-psbA intergenic spacer for 155 species] and one morphological (99 characters for 120 species) datasets, combined in a total evidence analysis. All traditionally recognized genera of Episcieae except for the monotypic genus Lampadaria are represented. Of the 21 sampled genera in Episcieae, 16 are represented by the generic type species. The genera Glossoloma and Crantzia are segregated from the genus Alloplectus as traditionally recognized. Other genera that are strongly supported as monophyletic include Alsobia, Columnea (with the inclusion of C. dielsii), Corytoplectus, and Episcia. Drymonia is weakly supported and is shown here to be morphologically diverse and in need of further evaluation. Evolution of fruit structure is examined in the context of the phylogenetic results presented here with two previously unreported features that are here referred to as capsules with tardily dehiscent and non-dehiscent endocarps. Three independent origins of resupinate flowers are inferred for Glossoloma, Nematanthus, and Crantzia. Strongly supported clades have centers of diversity in southeastern Brazil (Nematanthus, Codonanthe, Codonanthopsis, and Paradrymonia anisophylla), northern South America (Alloplectus, Drymonia, Columnea, Neomortonia), Central America (Alsobia, Oerstedina, Rufodorsia, Cobananthus), and two clades with diversity in the Guiana Shield [(Paradrymonia, Nautilocalyx, Chrysothemis) and (Lembocarpus, Cremersia, Rhoogeton)]. Neomortonia, a genus of three species, is poorly supported due to conflict among datasets.
10.2307/25065581|Of the 90-95 species included in the Rytidosperma clade of grasses (Danthonioideae: Poaceae) about 20 are native to southern Africa, most of these belonging to the genera Karroochloa, Schismus and Tribolium. Whereas morphological data identify all three genera as being monophyletic, the robustness of this pattern is compromised by high levels of homoplasy. Here we use molecular data (plastid trnL-trnF and nuclear ITS sequences) to re-evaluate phylogenetic relationships within the Rytidosperma clade, with the specific aim of testing the monophyly of the African genera. Separate parsimony analyses of the two partitions reveal low levels of incongruence, which may be attributable to incomplete lineage sorting or past hybridization. Analyses of the combined data produce well resolved, strongly supported topologies that are virtually identical, regardless of the inference method used (parsimony or Bayesian inference) or whether or not "conflict" taxa are included. Our data support the monophyly of the Rytidosperma clade (synapomorphies include a punctateovate hilum, a large embryo, and lodicule microhairs) as well as the monophyly of the Australasian-South American Rytidosperma s.l. However, the monophyly of Karroochloa, Schismus and Tribolium is strongly contradicted, all three genera being polyphyletic as currently defined. Although not implemented here, a minimum of five new combinations would be required to rectify this situation. Character reconstructions reveal extensive convergence in a number of morphological features, especially those previously used to define genera. We suggest that the convergent pattern of evolution displayed by these traits, most of which describe spikelet/diaspore morphology, is linked to their functionality in seed dispersal and burial, and that this has compromised their utility as phylogenetic markers.
10.2307/25065582|Phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences of the plastid rbcL gene were used to obtain a phylogenetic framework for the New Caledonian endemic genus Canacomyrica (monotypic). A further analysis of selected genera within Fagales combining DNA sequences of the rbcL gene, plastid trnL-F region and nuclear ITS region was also performed. In all analyses Canacomyrica fell into a well-supported clade in which it occupied a position as sister to the remaining genera of Myricaceae. A chromosome number of 2n = 16, consistent with Myricaceae, is reported for Canacomyrica for the first time. On the basis of the phylogenetic data and numerous shared morphological features, the original placement of Canacomyrica in Myricaceae is accepted. Canacomyrica is distinguished from other members of the family by the presence of staminodes in the female flower, a six-lobed perianth and a lamellular, laciniate style. The affinities of Myricaceae within Fagales are re-evaluated in the light of the unusual morphological features of Canacomyrica. The significance of staminodes in Canacomyrica is discussed with reference to pollination syndrome and incomplete suppression of male function in Myricaceae. A lectotype is designated for the name Canacomyrica monticola Guillaumin.
10.2307/25065583|Nuclear ribosomal DNA Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) and plastid trnL intron and trnL-F intergenic spacer regions were sequenced for 14 species of Oreobolus (Cyperaceae) from throughout most of its distribution range (South America, Australasia, and Hawai'i), with the exception of the Malesian species; Costularia laxa was used as outgroup. Phylogenetic trees were produced for ITS and trnL-F datasets using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood. We estimated species divergence times by enforcing a molecular clock on the Maximum Likelihood ITS tree, using the appearance of O. furcatus in Hawai'i, no earlier than 5.1 mya, as a calibration point. Our results support the monophyly of the South American species with the southern O. obtusangulus as sister to the rest. This South American clade is sister to the Australian O. pumilio, and the Australasian and Hawaiian species sampled form a basal grade. Oreobolus oligocephalus is embedded within Oreobolus, rejecting its separation in the monotypic genus Schoenoides. The transformed branch lengths of the ITS tree indicate a recent (5.5-6 mya) origin of the South American clade, followed by a northward migration and diversification of species along the Andes.
10.2307/25065584|The phylogeny of usneoid lichens with black pigmentation in the cortex was reconstructed using Bayesian and maximum parsimony analyses of nuclear ITS rDNA sequences. Fifty new partial sequences of 14 taxa were generated and assembled with 74 sequences from GenBank. Our results indicate that Neuropogon is polyphyletic with a core group nested within Usnea subgen. Usnea as sister-group to section Usnea. In addition an undescribed species is basal to the section Usnea clade and the Neuropogon species U. acanthella and U. durietzii have unresolved relationships in the Usnea subgen. Usnea clade. Monophyly of Neuropogon not nested within Usnea subgen. Usnea is rejected using three independent tests. Consequently, it is proposed to synonymise Neuropogon with Usnea. We recommend a conservative approach regarding nomenclatural changes from phylogenetic studies especially at the generic level when few taxa are studied.
10.2307/25065585|This paper investigates Willi Hennig's approach to homology in terms of character transformation series. Hennig adopted the botanist Walter Zimmermann's empirico-critical approach to systematics, which Zimmermann defended against "typological systematics" as expounded by the botanist B. H. Danser. In developing his concepts of (sym)plesiomorphy and (syn)apomorphy, Hennig built on J. H. Woodger's formal approach to homology in terms of symbolic logic and set theory. Woodger's formalization of the relation of homology, and Hennig's use of it, are discussed in the light of modern approaches to developmental biology.
10.2307/25065586|Genipa in Madagascar currently comprises 11 species of Rubiaceae. These species do not belong in the New World genus Genipa (Gardenieae) but instead should be placed in Old World genera belonging to the tribes Gardenieae and Octotropideae. Six species can be confidently placed in the genus Hyperacanthus (Gardenieae), and the appropriate new combinations are made. Five species belong to the tribe Octotropideae but can not be unequivocally placed in genera at the present time and consequently no combinations are proposed. Three new types of placentation are recorded in Hyperacanthus, which broaden the morphological characterization of the genus. These placentation types are apparently unique within Rubiaceae and perhaps even within Asterideae. Species descriptions, additional material examined, distribution, ecology and conservation assessments are given for each of the six new combinations in Hyperacanthus.
10.2307/25065587|We use data from the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the nuclear rDNA cistron and the chloroplast psbA-trnH intergenic spacer to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships among southern African species of Euphorbia. The results indicate that major re-organization is necessary of the groupings within Euphorbia that have been recognised in the past, since most of them turn out to be polyphyletic. Furthermore, in its present circumscription, Euphorbia itself is not monophyletic, nor do the southern African species form a monophyletic group. Both datasets show that the southern African species fall into four major groups, which we recognise as subgenera: Chamaesyce Raf., Esula Pers., Euphorbia and Rhizanthium (Boiss.) Wheeler. To accommodate the southern African species, subg. Chamaesyce is divided into sect. Chamaesyce, sect. Frondosae Bruyns, sect. nov., sect. Articulofruticosae Bruyns, sect. nov. and sect. Espinosae Pax & Hoffm. Subgenus Euphorbia is divided into sect. Euphorbia, sect. Monadenium (Pax) Bruyns, sect. Goniostema H. Baill. ex Boiss. and sect. Tirucalli Boiss. To re-establish the monophyly of Euphorbia, the genera Endadenium L.C. Leach, Monadenium Pax and Synadenium Boiss. are reduced to synonymy under Euphorbia subg. Euphorbia sect. Monadenium and the species are all transferred to Euphorbia. Consequently the subtribe Euphorbiinae now consists of the single, very large, very widely distributed and very diverse genus Euphorbia. Three of the subgenera (Chamaesyce, Esula, Euphorbia) are nearly cosmopolitan, showing the great age and wide extent of the radiation that has occurred within Euphorbia. The remaining subg. Rhizanthium is mainly African.
10.2307/25065588|Combined analyses of plastid regions indicate that the genus Ditassa (Asclepiadoideae, Apocynaceae) is polyphyletic and reveal a highly supported clade composed of shrubby species with minute leaves. These molecular data provide clear support for the recognition of a segregate genus from Ditassa, which we propose here as Minaria. Keys to distinguish Minaria from closely related genera and to identify the species of Minaria are provided. Eighteen nomenclatural combinations are proposed and the new species M. campanuliflora is described. The new genus is centred on eastern Brazil with two more widely distributed species extending as far as eastern Bolivia and NE Argentina. All the species occur in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, and it is from Minas that the name is derived; fourteen are endemic to the Espinhao Range, and most are narrow endemics.
10.2307/25065589|The utility of morphological and molecular data in phylogenetic inference has been widely debated. Potential utility is intrinsically related to size, so the importance of morphological data in phylogenetic inference is becoming increasingly uncertain as molecular datasets grow rapidly larger. To test the continuing relevance of morphological data, we present an empirical investigation of size in a selection of recent data matrices and contrast the possible methods of measuring relative potential utility. Molecular datasets contained significantly more variable and parsimony-informative characters, and implied a greater number of parsimony-informative character-state changes than morphological ones. The latter is suggested to be the most useful measure of potential utility in phylogeny reconstruction, and shows much greater variability and overlap between molecular and morphological datasets. Morphological datasets often have much greater phylogenetic utility than is apparent from their size, and thus molecular datasets are not always more useful simply because they contain a greater number of aligned characters. We recommend these more accurate measures of utility should be more widely reported in phylogenetic research.
10.2307/25065591|There is an ever-increasing amount of cytogenetic data in plant sciences obtained by cytometric techniques, particularly flow cytometry. However, as these methods determine nuclear DNA amount irrespective of the number of chromosomes, a discrepancy between cytometric and karyological data may occur. To avoid potential bias, we appeal for consistency, distinguishing between the terms "ploidy / aneuploidy" referring to chromosome numbers and "DNA ploidy / DNA aneuploidy" to nuclear DNA content.
10.2307/25065592|The Flora Reipublicae Popularis Sinicae (FRPS) is one of the largest floristic projects in the world. The final product, 80 volumes in 126 parts, represents work by four generations of Chinese plant taxonomists during 45 years (1959-2004) and treats 31,180 species (300 families, 3,434 genera) on over 40,000 pages. More than half of the species (54%) are endemic to China. This monumental flora has not yet been thoroughly reviewed. The history of the project is described with comments on outline, statistics, largest families and genera, names of authors and editors, quality, species concept, new taxa, specimens, and proofing and indexing.

These names appeared in a PhD thesis submitted to the Ludwig-Maximilians Universitt Mnchen, Germany, in 1997. Being printed and distributed to over 60 libraries, this thesis met the formal requirements for effective publication of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature then in force, but is no longer effectively published as a result of a retroactive change in the rules adopted at the International Botanical Congress in Vienna in 2005. As a result, the new names appearing in the thesis were not validly published and the nomenclatural novelties ineffective. The new names published in this thesis are validated here since they have found widespread use in numerous publications; moreover, the new generic delimitations have been confirmed by molecular studies. New species and combinations described in the genera concerned in publications other than the thesis will be validly published elsewhere.

In the present study, nomenclatural and taxonomic updates are provided. A treatment of some species described by Bertoloni (1819, 1820) on Raddi's Brazilian collections is also provided.

Epitype specimens are designated for three of the lectotypes. Of the species names, three were first published by J. R. & G. Forster and became the nomenclatural basis of names adopted by Linnaeus filius. All type choices made here are intended to support current usage of their respective names.

Stoechadina, H. sect. Helichrysum and H. sect. Virginea are presented, along with some additional comments on the nomenclature of the names involved and on the taxonomy of the taxa to which they apply. Twenty-three previously published typifications of names of taxa belonging to these sections are also listed and, in some cases, commented upon. The accepted taxa of Helichrysum for which we propose typification of accepted names or synonyms, or upon which we make comments, are, alphabetically: H. angustifolium (Lam.) DC., H. arenarium (L.)

Four new combinations are made. Forty-one lectotypes are designated, of which five were previously claimed to be holotypes and, being published post-2000, are no longer effective as lectotypifications. One neotype is also designated.
10.2307/25065599|The name Achillea collina was not validly published by L. Reichenbach in "Flora germanica excursoria" (1832), as generally believed, but by H. G. Reichenbach in "Icones florae Germanicae et Helveticae" (1854). A lectotype and an epitype are proposed to fix the current use of the name A. collina. With the same purpose, a neotype is designated for the name A. pannonica Scheele.
10.2307/25065601|Phoradendron englerianum and P. ernstianum, described by Jozef Paczoski based on Peruvian material have been recently neotypified. The original types, collected by Augusto Weberbauer in the Berlin herbarium (B) were destroyed during World War II. However, prior to these neotypifications, the two species names were inadvertently lectotypified using duplicate material for the original types kept at the Herbario Weberbauer (MOL) in Lima, Peru. Additional information on another Paczoski name, P. leucocarpum, a species transferred to Dendrophthora, is also provided.
10.2307/25065602|Gymnosporia (Wight & Arn.) Hook. f. (Celastraceae) is an Old World genus of about 99 species and 19 infraspecific taxa. A historical review of the genus and its conserved status are given. Sectional subdivision of Gymnosporia into eight sections is based mainly on characters from fruit morphology and leaf anatomy. Taxonomically useful characters at section level include: presence or absence of leaf and fruit indumentum, number of values in the fruit, aril colour and the degree to which it covers the seed. Diagnostic leaf anatomical characters are epidermis cell size, presence or absence of a hypodermis, uni- or multi-seriate epidermis, dorsiventral or isobilateral mesophyll and presence or absence of trichomes or papillae. The newly described sections (species/infraspecific taxa in brackets) are Buxifoliae (29); Capitatae (1); Gymnosporia (6/3); Mossambicenses (11/4); Vaccinifoliae (1/2); Pubescentes (1); Putterlickioides (1/2) and Tenuispinae (49/8). A key to the sections and a list of species in each section are provided. Morphological as well as leaf anatomical characters to assist in the identification of sections are tabulated. Eleven new name combinations, three new ranks and two new names are proposed.
10.2307/25065633|Here we show with both extensive real and simulated data that rigorous and time-intensive approaches, including parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods, to reconstructing large phylogenetic trees are unwarranted with small amounts of data (i.e., single or small numbers, 2-3 genes) because they actually produce trees with scores that are shorter or otherwise less optimal than the model tree or trees produced with larger amounts of data. Furthermore they also fail to obtain consistently more correct groups than simple parsimony methods, leaving the latter to be preferred. When numbers of variable sites are limited relative to numbers of taxa sampled, simpler swapping strategies perform as well as much more rigorous methods. We caution against confidence in any results based on small data sets, even if (or especially if) there have been thorough analyses. Analyses of such data sets for exploratory purposes should rely on simple search strategies and not use excessive branch swapping or time.
10.2307/25065635|Floras (and Faunas) have a rich history that involves examining questions on evolution and biogeography. However, in recent publications Floras have been viewed as an end unto themselves, separate from clade-based monographs and evolutionary studies. Floras are not a separate entity but rather a part of a continuum that involves databases, checklists, floras, biodiversity studies, and conservation biology as well as monographs. As the importance of Floras and related studies has become more apparent, there have been comments about the lag time between when specimens are collected and when they are identified, the amount of time it takes to describe new taxa, and how long it takes to finish floras and other projects. Some have referred to this as the "Taxonomic Impediment", and it is sometimes laid at the feet of taxonomists. Taxonomists can become more efficient by using various on-line resources and this will continue to speed up as more literature, etc. become available but the impediments to taxonomy are many, not the least of which is a lack of funding and the dwindling number of taxonomists. Changes in how systematists work and interact with other branches of science must take place in order to speed up research and re-establish the importance of Floras but only a substantial infusion of funds and personnel will really accelerate our progress.
10.2307/25065636|The internet has opened new opportunities for the distribution of systematic information. Advantages such as immediate worldwide distribution, affordable presentation of color illustrations, ease of updating the information, and low cost all suggest that the web is an ideal medium for the publication of taxonomic keys, descriptions, illustrations, and catalogues. Using examples from on-line interactive keys published on the web and the interactive key projects developed at the USDA ARS Systematic Botany and Mycology Laboratory (SBML), this paper presents important points to be considered in developing online interactive keys. These include the use of standard internet protocols, emphasis on images, and easy maintenance by scientists without intervention of IT staff. An additional technical point is that morphological data should be external to the key program. As a result, when data are changed or replaced, the system will automatically be updated. In addition, these data can be used for applications outside of the key. While the potential usefulness of internet keys and other on-line systematic information may be obvious, there are hurdles that must be overcome before there is any significant proliferation of on-line keys. Systematists must embrace the internet as a desirable publishing option, peer review and institutional reward systems must recognize the significance of non-paper publication, and systematists need to incorporate structured procedures for data collection.
10.2307/25065637|We describe an ongoing project to digitize information about plant specimens and make it available to botanists in the field. This first requires digital images and models, and then effective retrieval and mobile computing mechanisms for accessing this information. We have almost completed a digital archive of the collection of type specimens at the Smithsonian Institution Department of Botany. Using these and additional images, we have also constructed prototype electronic field guides for the flora of Plummers Island. Our guides use a novel computer vision algorithm to compute leaf similarity. This algorithm is integrated into image browsers that assist a user in navigating a large collection of images to identify the species of a new specimen. For example, our systems allow a user to photograph a leaf and use this image to retrieve a set of leaves with similar shapes. We measured the effectiveness of one of these systems with recognition experiments on a large dataset of images, and with user studies of the complete retrieval system. In addition, we describe future directions for acquiring models of more complex, 3D specimens, and for using new methods in wearable computing to interact with data in the 3D environment in which it is acquired.
10.2307/25065638|DNA barcodes have been successfully applied to a limited number of animal groups with the application of the mitochondrial gene, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1. Recently two DNA regions, the plastid trnH-psbA spacer and nuclear ribosomal ITS region, have been shown to have potential as an identification barcode for land plants, although with some significant drawbacks. The ideal barcode should be relatively short in length (700 bp), more variable between than within species, and easily amplifiable with universal primers. Building on current success, ongoing investigations are searching for the best barcode to apply to all land plants. Once established, a plant barcode may be effectively used in biodiversity inventories, conservation assessments, and applied forensic investigations. Advances in sequencing technology and the completion of the DNA barcode library have the potential to provide the public with increased access to information about the natural world.
10.2307/25065639|Chenopodiaceae-Salicornioideae (14-16 gen./c. 90 spp.) are distributed worldwide in coastal and inland saline habitats. Most of them are easy to recognize by their succulent-articulated stem with strongly reduced leaves and by flowers aggregated in dense, thick spike-shaped thyrses. ITS and the atpB-rbcL spacer were sequenced for 67 species representing 14 genera of Salicornioideae and analysed with maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood, a fossil-calibrated molecular clock using the penalized likelihood method, and lineage through time plots. The evolution of stem, leaf, and flower morphology was traced using MacClade. Both molecular markers indicate that the monophyletic Salicornioideae originated in Eurasia during the Late Eocene/Early Oligocene (38.2-28.7 Mya) and experienced a rapid radiation into its major lineages during the Early Oligocene with Allenrolfea/Heterostachys, Kalidium, Halopeplis and Halocnemum/Halostachys branching off early. Already in the Middle Miocene (19.6-14.6 Mya) all major lineages of Salicornioideae were present. These additionally include Arthrocnemum/Microcnemum, the Halosarcia lineage (which includes all Australian species except for the Australian Sarcocornia) and the Salicornia/Sarcocornia lineage. A high intercontinental dispersability can be observed in Salicornioideae in particular in the Salicornia/Sarcocornia lineage with multiple colonization events in America, Australia and South Africa linked to the global aridification during the Oligocene, Late Miocene and Pliocene. The comparatively low species number of many genera is explained by a low number of niches present in the extreme habitats of Salicornioideae, strong interspecific competition mainly by close relatives, and by Pleistocene extinctions. We detected an evolutionary trend towards increasing reduction of the leaf lamina in Salicornioideae, with an ovate or terete leaf with a decurrent base as the plesiomorphic condition. Opposite phyllotaxis has arisen at least two times in the subfamily and is strongly correlated with the pair-wise fusion of leaves (not bracts), the reduction of leaf lamina, and the articulation of stem. However, the articulated stems and reduced leaves also have evolved twice in lineages with alternate phyllotaxis, such as Allenrolfea and Kalidium caspicum. Only one shift from free to connate bracts occurred in Salicornioideae with at least one reversal within the Halosarcia lineage. The fusion of bracts is mostly accompanied by a partly or fully connation of bracts and axis resulting in club-shaped spikes in which the flowers are tightly embedded in cavities. Both molecular trees are conflicting with the traditional tribes indicating that their diagnostic characters have originated by convergent evolution. For reasons of stability and clarity we propose that only one tribe, Salicornieae, should be recognized. The traditional circumscription of most genera is supported by the molecular results except for the closely related genera of the Australian Halosarcia clade and the Sarcocornia/Salicornia complex. The monotypic Kalidiopsis clearly originated from within Kalidium, and it is therefore newly combined in Kalidium.
10.2307/25065640|The monophyletic status of Ledebouria, Resnova and Drimiopsis (Hyacinthaceae) was investigated using cladistic analyses of morphological characters as well as by combined trnL-F and morphology dataset. Based on morphology alone, numerous synapomorphies support Ledebouria, Resnova and Drimiopsis as three separate clades. In contrast, trnL-F data in a reduced taxon sample suggest that Resnova and Drimiopsis are imbedded within Ledebouria, while in combination with morphology again suggest them to be separate. The analysis of morphological data shows that the majority of morphological characters listed by Manning & al. (2004) to support Ledebouria s.l. are homoplasious or symplesiomorphies. A revised taxonomy of Ledebouria, Resnova and Drimiopsis is premature.
10.2307/25065641|The generic classification of the eucalypts, especially recognition of the genus Corymbia, has been controversial. The phylogeny of Corymbia and related eucalypt groups was investigated using nuclear ETS sequences, and combined ETS and ITS sequences. Both the ETS and combined datasets support the monophyly of Corymbia. Three major eucalypt clades are confirmed: Corymbia + Angophora; Eucalyptus s.s.; and the Eucalyptopsis group. Within Corymbia, relationships are broadly consistent with phylogenies based on morphological and anatomical characters; sections Ochraria, Blakearia, and Politaria are all supported as monophyletic; sect. Rufaria is monophyletic with the inclusion of the monotypic sect. Apteria. Within Eucalyptus s.s., relationships are generally consistent with those shown by previous molecular studies. Within the Eucalyptopsis group, Allosyncarpia is sister to the clade Stockwellia + Eucalyptopsis. Relationships between the major eucalypt clades are equivocal, but combined analysis of ETS and ITS data shows Corymbia + Angophora as sister to Eucalyptus-the rainforest taxa of the Eucalyptopsis group being outside this clade. Patterns of relationship and distribution are consistent with differentiation of major lineages of Corymbia prior to the isolation of taxa (now relictual) in eastern and south-western Australia, arguably before the mid-Miocene.
10.2307/25065642|A new name, Koeleria loweana Quintanar, Cataln & Castrov. nom. nov., is provided for Parafestuca albida (Lowe) E. B. Alexeev, the single species of the endemic Madeiran genus created by Alexeev to accomodate Festuca albida Lowe. A lectotype is selected and a first chromosome number of 2n = ca. 175 is reported for this taxon. Careful re-examination of morphological characters and new chromosome data support the inclusion of this relict Macaronesian lineage within the diploid-to-highly-polyploid complex genus Koeleria Pers. Phylogenetic analyses based on both nuclear ribosomal ITS and chloroplast trnT-F sequences further indicate that Parafestuca is neither related to Festuca nor to the festucoids (Loliinae, Poeae), but a member of a strong Koeleriinae core clade (Aveneae).
10.2307/25065643|Descurainia Webb & Berthel. (Brassicaceae) comprises approximately 45 species distributed throughout temperate areas of the world. In contrast to the small-flowered herbaceous taxa which constitute the majority of the genus, the seven species endemic to the Canary Islands are relatively large-flowered woody perennials. A molecular-based phylogeny of Canarian Descurainia was constructed using DNA sequences from nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and seven non-coding chloroplast regions. The results of parsimony and Bayesian analyses suggest that species of Descurainia in the Canary Islands are recently derived via a single colonization event. The closest continental relative is D. tanacetifolia, a perennial herb from the mountains of southwestern Europe. Chloroplast data suggest that both intra-island adaptive radiation and inter-island colonization have played a prominent role in the evolution of Descurainia in the Canary Islands. The most likely ancestral location of the island progenitor was the lowland scrub zone on Tenerife.
10.2307/25065644|Phylogenetic relationships of Isoglossinae (Acanthaceae: Justicieae) were studied with a taxon sample including all but one genus putatively placed in the lineage and a dataset composed of DNA sequences from three genic regions (nrITS, cp trnS/G, trnT/L). Two members each of the lineages of Justicieae previously shown to by phylogenetically adjacent to Isoglossinae were included to test monophyly of Isoglossinae. The Malagasy genera Forcipella and Populina were excluded from Isoglossinae by our analysis. The former was placed outside of Justicieae. The latter was placed with plants representing the Tetramerium lineage of Justicieae. Our results do not provide strong support for placement of Ptyssiglottis with Isoglossinae but also cannot refute this placement. Core Isoglossinae (i.e., members of Old World Conocalyx, Isoglossa, Brachystephanus and New World Kalbreyeriella, Stenostephanus s.l., Razisea) are monophyletic; these plants share "Grtelpollen", hypothesized to be a morphological synapomorphy for the group. Malagasy Conocalyx is part of the clade that includes all sampled species of Isoglossa and does not seem distinct from the latter genus. Sister to Isoglossa (including Conocalyx) is a lineage including all sampled species of Brachystephanus plus all New World Isoglossinae. Plants belonging to this last clade share monothecous stamens as a morphological synapomorphy. Our data do not support but cannot refute reciprocal monophyly of Brachystephanus and New World Isoglossinae. There is, in fact, very little variation among these taxa such that the problem is lack of resolution rather than support for relationships that conflict with current taxonomy. NW plants in particular are richly diverse in morphology and it is remarkable that this diversification is not reflected in variation in these three DNA regions.
10.2307/25065645|Genetic distances among populations and phylogenetic hypothesis concerning origin and diversification of Cytisus purgans s.l. are inferred by analysis of the ITS and ETS regions (nrDNA) and the trnL-trnF intergenic spacer (cpDNA). Cytisus purgans s.l., a shrub of western Mediterranean mountains, consists of two evolutionary units: C. balansae (Boiss.) Ball (Morocco, Algeria, southern Spain) and C. oromediterraneus Rivas Mart. & al. (France, Portugal, Andorra, central and northern Spain). The two units are related to different Cytisus groups, in Bayesian and Maximum Parsimony analyses, and may be genetically unrelated, their morphological similarities being the result of convergence. However, the incongruence in the position of both species in the ITS tree and the ETS and trnL-trnF trees suggests an alternative explanation. Genetic differentiation could be due to lineage sorting of allelic polymorphism in the ITS region of the common ancestor, and the morphological similarities the result of morphological parallelism. Cytisus balansae conserves ITS sequences related to old Cytisus taxa; rapid radiation may have led to a western Mediterranean lineage in which C. oromediterraneus originated.
10.2307/25065646|We present a revised classification for extant ferns, with emphasis on ordinal and familial ranks, and a synopsis of included genera. Our classification reflects recently published phylogenetic hypotheses based on both morphological and molecular data. Within our new classification, we recognize four monophyletic classes, 11 monophyletic orders, and 37 families, 32 of which are strongly supported as monophyletic. One new family, Cibotiaceae Korall, is described. The phylogenetic affinities of a few genera in the order Polypodiales are unclear and their familial placements are therefore tentative. Alphabetical lists of accepted genera (including common synonyms), families, orders, and taxa of higher rank are provided.
10.2307/25065647|Recent morphological and molecular research on Cytisus and allied genera has produced a great deal of new data relevant to systematics, which have not yet been incorporated into a consistent classification system of the genus. We have compared and evaluated recently published cladograms and phenograms based on morphological and molecular (nuclear and plastid DNA) characters. The genus Cytisus sensu lato, including Calicotome, Chamaecytisus, Chronanthus, and Lembotropis, appears to be monophyletic. A subdivision of the genus Cytisus in 13 sections is presented; one species, C. tribracteolatus, remains incertae sedis. A new section (C. sect. Dendrocytisus) and two new combinations for taxa in C. sect. Calicotome are proposed.
10.2307/25065648|Hypervariable, dominant molecular markers have become more common as characters for reconstructing evolutionary relationships, largely due to the difficulty in locating useful variation in DNA sequences in some very recently radiated taxa. Several of the methodological and analytical issues relating to these types of data are discussed, specifically focusing on inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) data. Caution in avoiding redundancy in primer selection is recommended, as well as the use of 3' anchored primers. Manual versus automated methods are briefly discussed, in addition to the influence of fluorescent markers on ISSR PCR reactions. A series of clustering and phylogenetic analysis methods are compared. Several similarity coefficients are available for clustering analyses of ISSR data. Those that exclude shared-absence characters appear most appropriate, such as Nei & Li's (1979) coefficient. However, more than one coefficient with this title is accessible from different software programs; care should be taken to be certain of the characteristics of a given coefficient. The potential suitability of Dollo, Fitch, or Camin-Sokal Parsimony for ISSR analyses is also discussed.
10.2307/25065650|The status and identities of Polyporus unitus, type of Perenniporia Murrill, of Boletus medulla-panis, their supposed synonymy, and the nomenclatural status of Perenniporia, Poria, and Physisporus are discussed. It is demonstrated, based on the study of its type, that Pol. unitus is not a synonym of B. medulla-panis even in the historically wider context than that recognised here. Although not precisely identifiable, the type of Pol. unitus does not belong to Perenniporia in its current sense, which is based on B. medulla-panis. Poria Pers. and Physisporus Chevall. are discussed as possible generic names for B. medulla-panis and related taxa. However, in view of the need for nomenclatural stability, it is proposed to maintain Perenniporia as currently accepted, with B. medulla-panis as conserved type. This name is epitypified and Perenniporia medulla-panis redefined. Based on a study of European specimens, two species are recognized within the historical circumscription of P. medulla-panis, Perenniporia meridionalis being described as new. Both species are compared with other European taxa with resupinate basidiomes and a key to all these taxa is presented.
10.2307/25065651|A lectotype is designated for Echites campanulata Sess & Mo. The lectotype is identified as Laubertia contorta (Mart. & Gal.) Woodson, making E. campanulata a synonym of that name, and provides a further step towards a full account of the species of Echites described by Sess and Moio.
10.2307/25065652|The name Dianthus guliae Janka is typified. This name has to be applied to the Italian yellow carnation, formerly known as D. ferrugineus Mill. The latter name is here instead shown to be applicable to an Iberian endemic currently known as D. crassipes R. Roem. Rejection of the name D. ferrugineus Mill. is discussed.
10.2307/25065653|The nomenclature and taxonomy of the American, sorediate Roccella species recently known as R. peruensis and R. humboldtiana is reassessed. The two taxa are conspecific and the first, oldest, legitimate name for the united taxon is Roccella gracilis Bory.
10.2307/25065654|The typifications of Juncus kochii F.W. Schultz and Juncus supinus Moench var. nigritellus W.D.J. Koch non (D. Don) F.W. Schultz are discussed. A specimen from the Koch Herbarium (at L) is designated lectotype for both names. The taxon to which they apply is at present best regarded as Juncus bulbosus L. subsp. kochii (F.W. Schultz) Reichg.
10.2307/25065655|As a part of a study for the project "Flora Briofitica Ibrica" three names, Bartramia halleriana Hedw., Bartramia pomiformis Hedw. and Anictangium aquaticum Hedw. [ Cinclidotus aquaticus (Hedw.) Bruch & Schimp.], described by Johannes Hedwig, are lectotypified.
10.2307/25065656|Acroscyphus N. Kitag. (1984) is a later homonym of Acroscyphus Lv. 1846. The first substitute name published for it is Acroscyphella N. Kitag. & Grolle, which antedates Austroscyphus R.M. Schust. by just over two weeks.
10.2307/25065680|Three mitochondrial (atp1, matR, nad5), four chloroplast (atpB, matK, rbcL, rpoC2), and one nuclear (18S) genes from 162 seed plants, representing all major lineages of gymnosperms and angiosperms, were analyzed together in a supermatrix or in various partitions using likelihood and parsimony methods. The results show that Amborella + Nymphaeales together constitute the first diverging lineage of angiosperms, and that the topology of Amborella alone being sister to all other angiosperms likely represents a local long branch attraction artifact. The monophyly of magnoliids, as well as sister relationships between Magnoliales and Laurales, and between Canellales and Piperales, are all strongly supported. The sister relationship to eudicots of Ceratophyllum is not strongly supported by this study; instead a placement of the genus with Chloranthaceae receives moderate support in the mitochondrial gene analyses. Relationships among magnoliids, monocots, and eudicots remain unresolved. Direct comparisons of analytic results from several data partitions with or without RNA editing sites show that in multigene analyses, RNA editing has no effect on well supported relationships, but minor effect on weakly supported ones. Finally, comparisons of results from separate analyses of mitochondrial and chloroplast genes demonstrate that mitochondrial genes, with overall slower rates of substitution than chloroplast genes, are informative phylogenetic markers, and are particularly suitable for resolving deep relationships.
10.2307/25065681|A phylogenetic analysis of monocots and related dicots was conducted, using a four-gene matrix consisting of two genes from the plastid genome (matK and rbcL) and two from the mitochondrial genome (atpA/atp1 and cob). The taxon sample includes 101 monocots and 36 dicots, and all four genes were sampled for all 137 taxa. Jackknife support was assessed for clades resolved by the four-gene analysis, and compared to support for the same clades by each of the four three-gene subset matrices, in order to quantify the degree to which each gene contributed to or detracted from support for each clade. Instances of positively and negatively correlated support for clades by genes of the same and different genomes were observed. In particular, the placement of Acorus within a clade that also includes Tofieldiaceae, Araceae, and Alismatales s.s., as opposed to its frequent placement as sister of all other monocots, is supported by atpA and matK. The results indicate that genes from the mitochondrial genome provide a unique test of relationships that have been inferred with plastid-encoded genes.
10.2307/25065682|The mitochondrial genome of land plants has a high level of evolutionary plasticity that may impair its use in phylogenetic analyses. Among the most challenging properties are RNA editing and retroprocessing of edited mRNA into the mitochondrial and/or nuclear genome as processed paralogs. Using mtDNA sequence data encoding for apocytochrome B (cob) and the alpha subunit of F1-ATP synthase (atp1) across the monocots, and in two subclades, alismatids and Agavaceae, it is shown that edited sites, despite being more homoplasious than non-edited sites, perform well on the trees, and that they are not randomly distributed among taxa but have a clade specific distribution. Indirect evidence for the presence of processed paralogs is presented and their likely evolutionary fate discussed.
10.2307/25065683|Previously, nucleotide substitution rates in mitochondrial DNA of Geraniaceae and Plantaginaceae have been shown to be exceptionally high compared with other angiosperm mtDNA lineages. It has also been shown that mtDNA introns were lost in Geraniaceae and Plantaginaceae. In this study we compile 127 DNA sequences from two partial exons of the mtDNA nad1 gene in Geraniaceae, Plantaginaceae, and other angiosperm groups for which rate accelerations have not been reported, to assess the extent and nature of the nucleotide substitution rate acceleration. Whereas Litorella appears to have undergone a rate acceleration comparable to that observed in Plantago, the Geraniacean sister group representative Hypseocharis biloba has not, indicating that the rate change has occurred between the split of Hypseocharis and the rest of the Geraniaceae. Silent/nonsilent rate ratios  have decreased threefold in the "fast mtDNA" clades compared with other angiosperms, whereas their codon usage bias is around 20% lower. Absence of RNA editing in Geraniacean and Plantago mtDNA genes is confirmed. Possible causes for the exceptional substitution rate accelerations observed in these lineages are discussed in terms of the retroprocessing process or the possibility of affected mitochondrial DNA polymerase  proofreading accuracy control.
10.2307/25065684|DNA sequence data and phylogenetic approaches have contributed greatly to our understanding of fern relationships. Nonetheless, the datasets analyzed to date have not been sufficient to definitively resolve all parts of the global fern phylogeny; additional data and more extensive sampling are necessary. Here, we explore the phylogenetic utility of the plastid atpA gene. Using newly designed primers, we obtained atpA sequences for 52 fern and 6 outgroup taxa, and then evaluated the capabilities of atpA relative to four other molecular markers, as well as the contributions of atpA in combined analyses. The five single-gene datasets differed markedly in the number of variable characters they possessed; and although the relationships resolved in analyses of these datasets were largely congruent, the robustness of the hypotheses varied considerably. The atpA dataset had more variable characters and resulted in a more robustly supported phylogeny than any of the other single gene datasets examined, suggesting that atpA will be exceptionally useful in more extensive studies of fern phylogeny and perhaps also in studies of other plant lineages. When the atpA data were analyzed in combination with the other four markers, an especially robust hypothesis of fern relationships emerged. With the addition of the atpA data, support increased substantially at several nodes; three nodes, which were not well-supported previously, received both good posterior probability and good bootstrap support in the combined 5-gene (> 6 kb) analyses.
10.2307/25065685|We performed a molecular phylogenetic analysis of the generic complex Nonea/Elizaldia/Paraskevia/Pulmonaria (Boraginaceae-Boragineae), using
10.2307/25065686|We describe the neotropical fern genus Serpocaulon (Polypodiaceae), segregated from Polypodium, and make new combinations for the forty known species. Serpocaulon has been recognized previously as a putatively natural group by several authors, based on morphological evidence, but never accorded generic rank. The monophyly of Serpocaulon is strongly supported in chloroplast DNA-based phylogenetic analyses, using the genes rbcL, rps4, rps4-trnS intergenic spacer, and trnL-F intergenic spacer on 29 samples from 22 species. Serpocaulon is readily separated from other subclades within Polypodiaceae, and especially from Polypodium, which is less closely related to Serpocaulon than are several other genera. Serpocaulon differs from other New World polypods in the combination of usually long-creeping, sparingly branched rhizomes with clathrate (sometimes strongly so), usually peltately attached scales; regularly anastomosing (goniophlebioid) veins with individual areoles chevron-shaped and each with a single, free, included excurrent veinlet; and non-paraphysate sori in one to 10 rows between costae and pinna margins. In Polypodium, the rhizome scales are not clathrate,  concolorous, and invaginated at the base, with somewhat overlapping basal lobes, and rhizomes are generally shorter-creeping and more frequently branched, the veins are free or forming a single row of areoles, and the sori uniseriate on each side of the costae. Most species of true Polypodium are north-temperate, Mexican, or Mesoamerican in distribution, while Serpocaulon is entirely neotropical or subtropical, with the greatest number of species in South America. There appears to be no convenient infrageneric division of the species within Serpocaulon, although the most widespread species, S. triseriale, is somewhat isolated at the base of the clade. Species with the thinnest rhizomes also have the fewest scales, and generally grow at high elevations. Species having the scaliest rhizomes, with scales spreading and strongly overlapping, form a weakly supported subclade, as do species with multiseriate rows of areoles between costae and pinna margins.
10.2307/25065687|Stachyuraceae consist of a single genus Stachyurus with about ten species endemic to eastern Asia. The family was recently shown to be sister to the western North American Crossosomataceae. The phylogeny of Stachyuraceae and its relatives was reconstructed based on sequences of four chloroplast DNA regions (trnL intron and adjacent trnL-trnF spacer, rps 16 intron, ndhF gene, trnS-trnG-trnG region) and the nuclear ribosomal ITS region. The monophyly of Stachyurus was strongly supported. The divergence time between Stachyuraceae and Crossosomataceae was estimated to be 68.25  10.36 million years ago (MYA) using the penalized likelihood method based on rbcL sequences data with fossil calibration. Stachyurus sigeyosii was previously synonymized as S. himalaicus, but our analysis shows that it is sister to the morphologically highly distinct S. praecox from Japan and does not form a clade with S. himalaicus.
10.2307/25065688|The relationships between Hemizygia and Syncolostemon are investigated. Parsimony analyses of morphological data and sequences of the trnL intron, trnL-trnF intergenic spacer and the rps16 intron were carried out separately and in combination. All analyses largely show strong support for the two genera as a monophyletic group; neither genus as currently circumscribed is monophyletic. They are herein merged under the earliest name Syncolostemon. The clade can be diagnosed by the presence of fused anterior stamens. Bremer's ancestral area analysis method suggests that the Afroalpine and Afromontane archipelago-like Regional Centre of Endemism may be the ancestral area for Syncolostemon s.l.
10.2307/25065689|A new family of flowering plants, Gerrardinaceae M. H. Alford, is created for Gerrardina Oliver, an African genus of two species formerly allied to tribe Homalieae of Flacourtiaceae. Unlike Homalieae, now placed in Salicaceae s.l. (Malpighiales), Gerrardina has cunonioid leaf teeth, a cupular receptacular disk, introrse anther dehiscence, and apical placentation. Phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence data from plastid rbcL and atpB indicate that Gerrardina is not closely allied with any family. It is unresolved among the "eurosids II" ("malvids"), a clade that includes Brassicales, Huerteales, Malvales, and Sapindales.
10.2307/25065690|A new genus, Physeterostemon, with two new species, P. fiaschii and P. jardimii, is described from southern Bahian Atlantic forest of Brazil. The genus can be distinguished from all other Melastomataceae by its 6-merous and diplostemonous flowers, toothed and persistent calyx, inferior ovary and dry, capsular fruits. The androecium consists of stamens that are slightly unequal in size with connectives that are unappendaged or minutely ventrally bituberculate and not prolonged below the thecae but dorsally and apically thickened; the anthers are oblong and rounded apically in ventral view, slightly projecting backwards over the connective in lateral view, but with a single ventral pore.
10.2307/25065691|Serratula chinensis and S. forrestii, both endemic to China, have been shown to be phylogenetically separated from all other species of Serratula and from each other in a previous molecular analysis, and are placed in the newly described genera Klaseopsis and Archiserratula, respectively. Full descriptions including illustrations are presented.
10.2307/25065692|Micromeria has recently been revealed polyphyletic by molecular analyses, with members of sect. Pseudomelissa placed in close relationship to Clinopodium vulgare. Morphological data suport transferring the section to Clinopodium. A list of names under Clinopodium (including 15 new combinations) is provided for the taxa hitherto included in Micromeria sect. Pseudomelissa. Three species names are typified.
10.2307/25065693|Seed morphology of 24 species of Stenocereus was examined by scanning electron microscopy. Quantitative and qualitative features were evaluated to identify groups of species using a phenetic analysis. Two groups were distinguished based on morphological variations of seed size, luster, multicellular sculpture, keeling, cell-size, periclinal wall sculpture, microrelief and HM complex shape and position relative to rim. All species studied were keeled, with isodiametric cells in the lateral region. Stenocereus alamosensis, S. kerberi and S. beneckei are unique among Stenocereus species in that their seeds are flat but lack micro-relief. Stenocereus aragonii and S. eichlamii have large, glossy seeds lacking micro-relief unlike other Stenocereus species, but like most Pachycereus, are unique in that cells in the lateral region display partly convex, low domes. Quantitative and qualitative congruence and discordance among characters that determine species groups in Stenocereus are discussed.
10.2307/25065694|Recent and past morphological and genetic studies suggest that the genus Acacia s.l. is better treated as a number of segregate genera. The generic segregates more or less follow the boundaries of the former Acacia subgenera. It is thus an appropriate time to transfer Acacia kelloggiana A.M. Carter & Rudd from Acacia subgenus Aculeiferum to Senegalia Rafinesque. Studies of New World members of Acacia subgenus Aculeiferum have also revealed the necessity to select neotypes or lectotypes for some names of species now placed in the genus Senegalia.
10.2307/25065695|William Nylander described two new lichen taxa from Angola and 24 from So Tom and Prncipe based on material gathered by various Portuguese collectors, mainly Francisco Newton and Adolpho Moller. This material is deposited in the herbaria of Porto (PO), Coimbra (COI) and Helsinki (H-NYL). A list of these specimens and information on the types, including 12 new lectotypifications, is presented here.
10.2307/25065696|All the seven accepted names for species of the Jacobaea maritima group are discussed and typified. Lectotypes are selected for Cineraria bicolor Willd. from the Willdenow Herbarium (B); C. gibbosa Guss. and C. nebrodensis Guss. from the Gussone Herbarium (NAP); Othonna maritima L. from the Clifford Herbarium (BM); Senecio gnaphalodes Sieber from the Brno Herbarium (BRNM) and S. taygeteus Boiss & Helder. from the Boissier Herbarium (G). A neotype, conserved in the Herbarium of the University of Calabria (CLU), is proposed for Cineraria ambigua Biv. Four needed combinations under Jacobaea Mill. are here proposed for the first time: J. maritima subsp. bicolor (Willd.) Peruzzi & al., J. maritima subsp. gibbosa (Guss.) Peruzzi & al., Jacobaea ambigua subsp. nebrodensis (Guss.) Peruzzi & al. and J. ambigua subsp. taygetea (Boiss. & Heldr.) Peruzzi & al.
10.2307/25065697|Morphological evaluation of a previously overlooked isotype, together with an improved comprehension of its Costa Rican type locality, permit the definitive application of the long-misunderstood name Guarea hoffmanniana C. DC. to the species known most recently as Guarea macropetala T. D. Penn. The former name is lectotypified on the newly found isotype, and the latter name is formally relegated to taxonomic synonymy. All collections examined for this study are cited.
10.2307/25065698|The types of seven names of Carex species described by Hudson in the first and second editions of Flora anglica are designated here. Four lectotypes are chosen; two are plates, from Morison and Plukenet, a third is from original material conserved at BM-SL (all of them fixed by epitypes) and a fourth is from original material conserved at K. For the remaining three names, we have designed neotypes, selecting among appropriate material from the same regions and habitats indicated by Hudson.
10.2307/25065699|Notes on the taxonomy and nomenclature of Ornithogalum subg. Cathissa (Salisb.) Baker ( Cathissa Salisb.) are presented. This group includes three species described from the western Iberian Peninsula and northern Morocco (O. broteroi M. Lanz, O. concinnum Salisb., O. reverchonii Lange), with spicate to subspicate inflorescences and corolla segments lacking conspicuous green stripes on the reverse surface. The accepted taxa are listed with their synonyms and types are indicated for all the names involved, including the designation of a neotype for O. concinnum and a lectotype for O. reverchonii. Short diagnoses are provided for accepted taxa to facilitate identification.
10.2307/25065700|Lectotypes and neotypes are designated for 17 previously untypified Linnaean plant names belonging to the family Convolvulaceae. These newly proposed types support the current usage of the names concerned. Earlier type statements are discussed.
10.2307/25065701|Cyperus hirtus Thunb. from South Africa is lectotypified and shown to belong to Fimbristylis squarrosa Vahl. Misidentification of this plant and misapplication of its name by Kkenthal in 1936 has resulted in American botanists using Bulbostylis hirta (Thunb.) Svenson (e.g., in Flora Mesoamericana) for the pantropical taxon Bulbostylis hispidula (Vahl) R. Haines.
25065731|This paper discusses the need for an up-to-date linear sequence of angiosperm families based on the APG system. The methods used to generate the sequence are clearly laid out, and the sequence is provided in a simple numbered list of 479 families. The need for a consensus classification of families is also discussed.
25065732|Many species comprise multiple cytotypes that represent autopolyploids, or presumed autopolyploids, of the basic diploid cytotype. However, rarely has an autopolyploid been formally named and considered to represent a species distinct from its diploid progenitor (Zea diploperennis and Z. perennis represent a rare example). The major reasons why autopolyploids have not been named as distinct species are: (1) tradition of including multiple cytotypes in a single named species; and (2) tradition and convenience of adhering to a broad morphology-based taxonomic (or phenetic) species concept. As a result, plant biologists have underrepresented the distinct biological entities that actually exist in nature. Although it may seem "practical" to include morphologically highly similar cytotypes in one species, this practice obscures insights into evolution and speciation and hinders conservation. However, we do not suggest that all cytotypes should be named; each case must be carefully considered. A number of species comprising multiple cytotypes have been thoroughly investigated. Drawing on the literature, as well as our own experience with several autopolyploids (Tolmiea menziesii, Galax urceolata, Chamerion angustifolium, Heuchera grossulariifolia, Vaccinium corymbosum), we reassess the traditional view of plant autopolyploids as mere cytotypes. When considered carefully, many "unnamed" autopolyploids fulfill the requirements of multiple species concepts, including the biological, taxonomic, diagnosability, apomorphic, and evolutionary species concepts. Compared to the diploid parent, the autopolyploids noted above possess distinct geographic ranges, can be distinguished morphologically, and are largely reproductively isolated (via a diversity of mechanisms including reproductive and ecological isolation). These five autopolyploids (and probably many others) represent distinct evolutionary lineages; we therefore suggest that they be considered distinct species and also provide a system for naming them.
25065733|Based on chloroplast DNA sequences we develop a phylogenetic hypothesis of the diversification of liverworts (Marchantiophyta) with an extant diversity of about 6,000 species. Divergence time estimates obtained using penalized likelihood with integrated fossil evidence suggest a Late Ordovician origin of Marchantiophyta, a separation of Haplomitriopsida from the remainder of liverworts in the Early Devonian, a split of Jungermanniopsida and Marchantiopsida in the Late Devonian, and a separation of Metzgeriidae and Jungermanniidae in the Late Carboniferous. Leafy liverworts (Jungermanniidae) with an extant diversity of ca. 4,500 species split into Porellales and Jungermanniales in the Early-Middle Permian. Our data provide evidence for a diversification of Jungermanniidae in the Triassic-perhaps coinciding with the recovery of terrestrial vegetation from the Perm/Trias extinction-and an enhanced diversification in the Cretaceous and Early Tertiary. The latter diversification events may coincide with the establishment of modern rainforests in the Late Cretaceous to Early Tertiary that were dominated by derived groups of angiosperms. In addition, the Late Mesozoic and Early Tertiary diversification of leafy liverworts may have also been influenced by drastic changes in the geographical structure of the land masses and the global climate.
25065734|The monophyly of the woody bamboos Schizostachyum s.str., Cephalostachyum, Dinochloa, Leptocanna, Melocanna, Melocalamus, and Pseudostachyum was tested based on sequence data of the nuclear GBSSI gene and plastid trnL-F intergenic spacer, using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference. Schizostachyum s.str., Cephalostachyum, Leptocanna, Melocanna, and Pseudostachyum were resolved as a monophyletic group while Dinochloa and Melocalamus were excluded and should be referred to another subtribe. Schizostachyum s.str. and Cephalostachyum were strongly supported as monophyletic in both the separate and combined analyses; their circumscriptions should be modified, however. Leptocanna and Schizostachyum sanguineum must be united with the Cephalostachyum subclade and Cephalostachyum virgatum and C. pergracile transferred to the Schizostachyum subclade. Melocanna and Pseudostachyum were strongly supported as good genera.
25065735|The circumscription and phylogeny of Deschampsia were studied for the first time by parsimony analysis of nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and plastid trnL intron sequences. The traditional sectional division based on morphology was not supported by sequence data, which showed differences between core Deschampsia s.str. (mainly represented by D. cespitosa), D. atropurpurea and D. flexuosa. Differences in the ITS marker included insertions in the sequence of D. atropurpurea; the trnL marker contained a deletion shared by all Deschampsia sequences, excluding D. atropurpurea and D. flexuosa, and an insertion in D. flexuosa. ITS sequences also differed in an insertion shared by Northern Hemisphere accessions. Both markers produced similar tree topologies but D. klossi, in spite of being morphologically close to Deschampsia s.str., fell with D. flexuosa outside the core of the genus in the trnL tree. Molecular evidence corroborates morphological and cytological data supporting exclusion of D. atropurpurea and D. flexuosa from Deschampsia and their treatment as separate genera. The position of D. klossi needs further investigation.
25065736|Peridiscaceae, comprising Peridiscus, Soyauxia, and Whittonia, are an enigmatic angiosperm family of uncertain composition and placement. Although some have placed Soyauxia in other families (e.g., Flacourtiaceae, Medusandraceae), rather than in Peridiscaceae, sequence data for five genes (material of Whittonia could not be obtained) provide strong support for a clade of Soyauxia and Peridiscus. This evidence, combined with the strong morphological similarity of Peridiscus and Whittonia, support a monophyletic Peridiscaceae of three genera. Molecular analyses of a three-gene (rbcL, atpB, 18S rDNA) dataset for 569 taxa indicate that Peridiscus + Soyauxia together with Daphniphyllaceae form a clade that is sister to the rest of Saxifragales. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses of Saxifragales using a five-gene (rbcL, atpB, matK, 18S rDNA, 26S rDNA) dataset place Peridiscaceae (posterior probability of 1.00) Peridiscaceae as sister to the remainder of Saxifragales, albeit without high posterior probability (pp = 0.78). Parsimony places a well-supported Peridiscaceae (100% bootstrap) as sister to Paeoniaceae within a paraphyletic Hamamelidaceae, a placement that may be due to long-branch attraction. Following removal of Paeoniaceae from the dataset, parsimony trees place Peridiscaceae as sister to the remainder of Saxifragales. Although the placement of Peridiscaceae is not well supported in any analysis, molecular data suggest that Peridiscaceae do not have as their closest relatives Saxifragaceae, Iteaceae, Pterostemonaceae, Haloragaceae, or Crassulaceae, but instead are more closely related to woody members of Saxifragales (Altingiaceae, Cercidiphyllaceae, Hamamelidaceae, and Daphniphyllaceae); several morphological features similarly suggest a relationship of Peridiscaceae to these woody families. The low support for the placement of Peridiscaceae is not surprising; previous analysis indicate that Saxifragales underwent a rapid, ancient radiation, and resolving relationships among members of the clade, particularly the basal grade of woody taxa, has been extremely difficult.
25065737|With 23 suffrutescent to woody perennial species distributed in diverse ecological zones, Sideritis subgenus Marrubiastrum constitutes one of the largest plant radiations in the Macaronesian archipelagos. In an earlier study, we investigated the evolution of Sideritis in Macaronesia using chloroplast restriction site (RFLP) data, but inferences were limited by the lack of a nuclear marker. A second study used sequence data to determine the continental origin of the Macaronesian group, but that study included only seven island taxa in a much larger sampling of continental taxa. For the present study, we generated new datasets from sequences of the nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacers (ITS) and two plastid regions (trnL intron, trnT-trnL intergenic spacer) in order to reconstruct relationships among all extant island taxa using both nuclear and chloroplast data. Relationships based upon plastid data suggest that there may be a geographical component to cpDNA variation. Individual phylogenies reconstructed from the nuclear and chloroplast sequence data were incongruent, and differing placements of taxa were well supported in each of the two datasets. This incongruence has enabled us to identify several instances of potential cytoplasmic introgression, suggesting that hybridization may have been important in the evolution of Sideritis in Macaronesia. Because the ITS phylogeny concurs with current taxonomic circumscriptions in the Macaronesian subgenus, we reassess patterns of diversification based upon the nuclear tree.
25065738|Due to conflicting morphological characters, the systematic placement of the Mediterranean-Central Asian Grimmia pitardii, lately considered a member of Campylostelium (Ptychomitriaceae), has been controversial. Phylogenetic inferences based on the chloroplast gene rps4 and the trnL-F region were performed to clarify its systematic affinities. Grimmia pitardii is consistently resolved as a member of a maximally supported clade together with the genus Campylostelium. This combined clade forms the sister group to a similarly high supported clade comprising Grimmia, Racomitrium, Coscinodon, and Schistidium. Consequently, G. pitardii must be treated as Campylostelium pitardii (Corb.) E. Maier. Analysis of the systematic position of Campylostelium and Ptychomitrium, traditionally placed in the family Ptychomitriaceae, yielded two conflicting topologies: one groups Ptychomitrium and Campylostelium, whilst the second branches Campylostelium first, grouping Ptychomitrium with Grimmiaceae.
25065739|Use of molecular data for phylogenetic studies in Juncaceae/Cyperaceae beginning in 1993 has resulted in an uncertain taxonomic position of the Andean Oxychlo Phil. RbcL data used in earlier analyses resolved Oxychlo inside Cyperaceae or as their sister group. However, many typically juncaceous morphological features (e.g., spiro- or ortostichous leaves, many ovules, prominent tepals) differentiate Oxychlo from Cyperaceae. The present paper reveals relationships among the genera Oxychlo, Patosia, Distichia, Marsippospermum and Rostkovia based on both morphological and molecular data (cpDNA: rbcL, trnL intron and trnL-trnF intergenic spacer, matK and nrDNA: ITS1 & 2). Oxychlo is undoubtedly a member of Juncaceae based on both sources of data. It does not form a monophyletic lineage but is clustered with the Andean genera Patosia and Distichia. Oxychlo andina and O. bisexualis are closely related and form a sister group to O. haumaniana and O. castellanosii based on strict consensus tree of molecular data. Their position remains unresolved based on morphological data, however.
25065740|The palm Coccothrinax argentata occurs on both the southern Florida mainland and the Florida Keys, but the populations are morphologically distinct. The mainland populations tend to be shorter in stature than the insular populations. We tested the hypothesis that differences in stature were the result of genotypic selection because of different environmental conditions between the mainland and the Keys. We used a combined approach of morphological data gathered from a long-term common garden experiment and ISSR molecular data. After eleven years, the common garden plants are exhibiting differences in stature, but the differences are not associated with provenance. In addition, plants from different source populations have differences in ISSR profiles. We reject the hypothesis that differences in stature are solely the result of differences in environment. Morphological and molecular data do not exhibit clearly defined discontinuities that could be used to distinguish the populations as separate taxa. This study is the first common garden experiment with palms, which are long-lived and slow-growing, and the first to examine genetic differences between plant populations from mainland Florida and Florida Keys.
25065741|A strongly isolated population of Cochlearia in North-Western Ukraine was analysed using highly discriminating AFLP markers, to clarify the confusing taxonomy of the genus at the eastern edge of its distribution in Europe. The analysis revealed a high level of similarity between the Ukrainian population and C. pyrenaica, supporting its inclusion within this species and not within C. polonica. Cochlearia polonica remains a narrowly distributed endemic of the Polish lowlands. Most genetic variability of the Central European populations of the diploid C. pyrenaica (Ukraine, Carpathians, Alps) was found among populations. In addition, the populations significantly differentiated into two distinct groups (Alps versus Carpathians and Ukraine). The strong genetic divergence of the Ukrainian population together with its low within population variability (similarity indices between individuals exceeding 0.9) highlights the need for conservation efforts to prevent the irreversible loss of this distinct gene pool of C. pyrenaica.
25065742|Taxonomy in the apomictic genus Cotoneaster L. has been controversial. Two Scandinavian species were recently described from C. integerrimus s.l., C. canescens Vestergr. ex B. Hylm and C. scandinavicus B. Hylm. Morphometric analyses of leaf shape and DNA marker analysis with RAPD were applied to investigate the differentiation between these two tetraploid species, and determine whether two morphologically aberrant variants of C. scandinavicus, informally known as "balticus" and "gotlandicus", deserve taxonomic recognition. These taxa proved rather difficult to distinguish with morphological characters and RAPD data suggested an even more continuous pattern of variation. The geographically and morphologically narrowly delimited, prostrate C. scandinavicus "gotlandicus" was relatively homogenous but very close to other glabrous-leaved, more erect genotypes. The more broadly delimited C. canescens, C. scandinavicus and C. scandinavicus "balticus", however, completely overlapped genetically. These results are in contrast to the relatively high concordance between morphology-based and molecular marker-based discontinuities that has been reported in some other apomictic genera. Most likely, differences among apomicts in endosperm formation, propensity for fertilization and colonization history, are the culprits behind this lack of a consistency.
25065743|Luzula sect. Luzula is the most taxonomically diverse group within the genus. It displays a wide range of chromosome numbers due to polyploidy and agmatoploidy. In eight taxa of the section from Slovenia, NE Italy and S Austria, chromosomes were counted and the nuclear DNA amount, expressed as the C-value, was measured in root tip cells of seedlings, using interphase-peak DNA image cytometry. Previously known karyotypes were confirmed (Luzula campestris (L.) DC. subsp. campestris: 2n = 12 AL; L. multiflora (Ehrh.) Lej. subsp. multiflora: 2n = 24 AL and 2n = 36 AL; Luzula divulgata Kirschner: 2n = 24 AL; L. sudetica (Willd.) Schult.: 2n = 48 CL; and L. alpina Hoppe: 2n = 12 AL + 24 BL), and a new karyotype 2n = 24 BL was found in the region. Two new taxa were discovered and described: L. exspectata Bai & Jogan (2n = 24 BL) and L. divulgatiformis Bai & Jogan (2n = 24 BL). The 2C-value proved to be similar in diploid (L. campestris) and agmatoploid taxa (L. sudetica, L. exspectata, L. divulgatiformis) and ranged from 0.83 to 0.97 pg DNA. In the case of true polyploidy, the nuclear DNA amount approximately doubled in the tetraploids L. divulgata and L. multiflora (2C-value 2.09 and 1.88 pg, respectively) and tripled in hexaploid L. multiflora (2C-value 2.73 pg). The 2C-value of 2.06 pg of the partial agmatoploid L. alpina approximately equals the DNA amount in true tetraploids.
25065744|Phylogenetic studies of organelle DNA sequences at low taxonomic levels present a researcher with specific experimental design challenges. Such studies require sampling of large numbers of individuals, many of which share identical haplotypes. The process is often limited by time and money required for DNA sequencing. A variety of mutation detection methods has been developed to circumvent this limitation. This paper briefly reviews the available methods and presents some of their advantages and disadvantages. The applicability of these methods to nuclear DNA studies is discussed.
25065745|Taxonomic features of Panicum obtusum, a species ranging from Southern United States to Central Mexico and previously classified in subg. Agrostoides, sect. Obtusa of Panicum, are reviewed and compared with other taxa in the tribe Paniceae. The species is transferred to the new genus Hopia on the basis of morphological and molecular characters. Affinities of the new genus with other genera of Paniceae are discussed.
25065746|Tiputinia foetida is described here as a new genus of flowering plants in the Thismiaceae. A single individual of this achlorophyllous mycoheterotroph was found flowering in leaf litter at the Tiputini Biodiversity Station in Amazonian Ecuador. This new taxon is placed in Thismiaceae based on its pyramidal stigma, lack of septal nectaries, and other floral and vegetative features consistent with the other four genera known in the family. It differs from Thismia, the only other genus of the family present in the Neotropics, by its placentae parietally attached to the apex of the ovary; its identical, strap-shaped tepals that are blunt-tipped and horizontally spreading; and its stamens with highly ornamented filaments that are basally broad and erect, then curve inwards to partially obstruct the mouth of the floral tube. Some of these same characters, however, occur in African genera of Thismiaceae such as Afrothismia, Haplothismia, and Oxygyne. The closest relative of Tiputinia may actually be Oxygyne, which differs in having three (vs. six) stamens and less ornamented filaments. At anthesis, the flower of Tiputinia emits a foetid odor that attracts carrion flies and other insects that could function as pollinators. We hypothesize that Tiputinia evolved its scent and unusual floral morphology as a deceit pollination mechanism to attract flies or other pollinators down into the floral tube, where they would first contact the stigma, lay eggs on the inner, horizontal ridges of the tube, and finally contact the latrorse anthers as the insects emerge from the flower. Since foetid odors are capable of attracting pollinators from long distances in other carrion insect-pollinated plants, this pollination system may be particularly effective in rare, ephemeral, and otherwise inconspicuous forest herbs such as Thismiaceae.
25065747|Modern authors have not agreed on a satisfactory system of generic delimitation among woody Boraginales. Recent treatments have recognized a broadly defined Cordia with 3-7 subgenera or sections. Molecular sequence data suggest an alignment of genera that is consistent with morphological and palynological data. In advance of publication of several major floristic studies on Boraginaceae, generic delimitation of the traditional Cordioideae is reviewed. Coldenia, formerly considered a member of Ehretioideae, is sister to Cordia s.l. Within Cordia s.l., Varronia is sister to the rest of the genus and its resurrection as a distinct genus is proposed. Thus defined, Cordiaceae comprise three genera, all of which are monophyletic and consistent with vegetative, floral, and pollen morphology.
25065748|A recent molecular study of Colchicaceae showed four of the 19 genera and two of the five tribes to be paraphyletic. The genus Colchicum is nested within Androcymbium, Onixotis constitutes a grade between Neodregea and Wurmbea, Gloriosa is intermixed with species of Littonia, and Burchardia forms a grade sister to the rest of the family. The current classification of Colchicaceae is discussed and a revised classification is presented, based on the primary principle of monophyly. The recognition of subfamily Wurmbaeoideae for the cormous genera results in a paraphyletic Uvularioideae unless a further two or three subfamilies are recognized among the rhizomatous members of the family. This is not justified in such a small family. A revised tribal taxonomy is presented, recognizing six morphologically diagnosable, monophyletic clades at tribal level. The tribes were defined to maximize nomenclatural and taxonomic stability. Three emended tribes, Anguillarieae, Colchiceae and Iphigenieae, are recognized in the wurmbaeoid clade. The uvularioid grade is divided into Uvularieae and two new tribes, Burchardieae and Tripladenieae. The genus Burchardia is probably paraphyletic and further tribes may be required to accommodate segregates pending analysis of all species in the genus. The genera Neodregea and Onixotis are included within a widened circumscription of Wurmbea, defined by an ebracteate, spiciform inflorescence and three leaves. The genus Littonia is included within an expanded Gloriosa, distinguished by a stoloniferous corm, opposite or verticillate lower leaves, yellow to orange flowers, and more or less fleshy seeds. The necessary new combinations in these two genera are provided.
25065749|Whether categories in different higher taxa are comparable can be interpreted as a matter of degree that in turn depends upon taxonomic distance. With this interpretation, comparability was assessed relative to two standards of comparison: the mean genetic distance among species within genera of animals for two mitochondrial genes, and the extent to which species and genera are subdivided in folk classifications of animals and plants in different cultures. For both standards of comparison, a nonparametric randomization procedure was used on large published databases to estimate the decrease in comparability caused by differences among higher taxa at each rank. Species in different genera within the same family proved in some cases to be substantially less comparable than species in the same genus; and species and genera in different families within the same order were in some cases substantially less comparable than those in the same family; but comparability then declined only slightly for species and genera in different orders, classes, and phyla. Categories in different phyla are therefore almost as comparable as categories in different classes within the same phylum, orders within the same class, and even families within the same order.
25065750|A truly forgotten Amazonian botanical collection was that made by Dr. Luigi Buscalioni (1863-1954), whose 1899 expedition to southeastern Amazonia and particularly the edaphic savannas and transitions to drier savanna woodlands of the Brazilian Planalto at the southeastern edge of Amazonia-part of it still a botanical frontier-produced some 5,000 collections of plants and fungi. He traveled up the Tocantins and Araguaia rivers, penetrating into what are now the states of Tocantins and Gois. Buscalioni's was a relatively early expedition for Amazonia: only six substantial collections (>1,000 numbers) are known to have been made prior to 1900 in all of Brazilian Amazonia. Moreover, the upper Rio Tocantins and the Rio Araguaia remain poorly known botanically, so his collection undoubtedly contains much valuable information about the original flora of that region. This information unfortunately has been unavailable, however, because most of the collection languished in bundles at the RO herbarium for the best part of a hundred years, from the turn of the century until 1984, when the junior author discovered their existence during a re-organization of the RO herbarium, and 1995, when a visit by the senior author coincided with the recovery of revealing historical archives. The label information and preliminary taxonomy have now been data-based and are available over the Internet. In addition to his collections, Buscalioni's Amazonian legacy includes participation in debates about the origins of myrmecophily and the Amazonian savannas, the botanical identity of the commercial latex called caucho, and (indirectly) the founding of the INPA research institute in Manaus, Brazil. His scientific reputation and especially his efforts to found an international institute for Amazon plant research in Brazil brought him into dialogue with the great botanists of the day.
25065751|The African Plant Checklist and Database Project (APCD) provides botanists with the first angiosperm checklist and database for Sub-Saharan Africa. This was achieved by merging the existing datasets for Southern and Tropical Africa. The checklist is published as a one-off hardcopy publication. The database, with all attached additional inforamtion, is freely accessible via the internet and will be regularly updated. The APCD, for the first time, gives accurate statistics for the angiosperm flora of Sub-Saharan Africa. There are 50,136 current taxa (representing approximately 44,830 species) in the database, plus an additional 393 taxa where there are discrepancies in genus concept between the two original datasets. Taxa are classified into 274 families and 3,802 current genera. Several other important statistics can also be drawn from the database. Furthermore, by pointing out problems and discrepancies in taxonomic opinion, the APCD highlights taxa where further research is necessary. The APCD will be an invaluable tool to botanists working on the African flora. It also has an important role to play in greater projects such as the Global Plant Checklist Project and has already emerged as a nomenclatural standard for the African Plants Initiative.
25065754|A revision of the nomenclature of this group of species is presented as part of a wider taxonomic revision. Sixteen neotypifications, three lectotypifications, six epitypifications and one new combination [Anthurium ianthinopodum (Schott ex Engl.) Nadruz & Mayo, comb. et stat. nov.] are proposed, based largely on the coloured and black and white drawings collection of H.W. Schott at the Vienna Natural History Museum (Schott Icones Aroideae et Reliquiae) and herbarium material which matches the original descriptions in critical characters.
25065755|Winterocereus Backeberg is accepted in preference to "Hildewintera F. Ritter", a well established name that was published slightly earlier, but not validly. A new combination in Winterocereus is provided here.
25065756|The genus Peperomia includes 1,500-1,700 accepted species, making it one of the giant genera of angiosperms. The infrageneric classification usually adopted is that of Dahlstedt (1900) which divides Peperomia into 9 subgenera, 7 sections and 4 subsections. In 1930, two of these sections were treated comparably with Dahlstedt's subgenera, making a total of 11 primary subdivisions of Peperomia. Later, different authors added a few more subgenera to include some island species. The names of only a few subgenera, sections or subsections of Peperomia have been typified. In this paper, we present a survey of all subgenera, sections and subsections described in the genus Peperomia and we designate nomenclatural types for names that have not yet been typified.
25065757|Charles Wright made numerous plant collections in Cuba during the $19^{{\rm th}}$ century, and numerous new species were described based on his specimens. The application of Bourreria names (Ehretiaceae, Boraginales) described by O.E. Schulz, J. Miers, and A.H.R. Grisebach has been confused because of the unusual way, in which collection numbers and locality information was assigned to the Wright collections upon which the names were based. The confusion has been compounded by the loss of specimens in Berlin during World War II. The nomenclatural status of Bourreria names based on Wright collections is reviewed, and lectotypes are selected for Bourreria badia, Bourreria homalophylla, Bourreria polyneura, Bourreria setoso-hispida, and Crematomia attenuata (= Bourreria baccata). A complete list of Wright's Bourreria collections is provided as online supplement, along with notes on the identity of the component of each duplicate, as Wright and co-workers often assigned multiple gatherings to the same collection number.
25065758|The identity of Lobelia minima Sims, a taxon described as native to Cape of Good Hope, is reconsidered. After analysis of the protologue and the morphological traits of the lectotype, a color illustration of a plant grown in a greenhouse, a South African origin is discarded and the plant is identified as Solenopsis minuta subsp. balearica, an endemic from Mallorca (Balearic Islands). Synonymy and a brief description are provided, and an epitype is chosen to stabilize the name at species rank, as Solenopsis minima.
25065759|Hallea J.-F. Leroy (Rubiaceae), published in 1975, is a later homonym of Hallea G.B. Mathews (fossil "seed" morphogenus of unknown affinity) published in 1948, and is, therefore, illegitimate. A new generic name Fleroya Y.F. Deng is proposed here as a replacement.
25065788|We propose in this paper to use three regions of plastid DNA as a standard protocol for barcoding all land plants. We review the other markers that have been proposed and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. The low levels of variation in plastid DNA make three regions necessary; there are no plastid regions, coding or non-coding, that evolve as rapidly as mitochondrial DNA generally does in animals. We outline two, three-region options, (1) rpoC1, rpoB and matK or (2) rpoC1, matK and psbA-trnH as viable markers for land plant barcoding.
25065789|Delimitation and classification of the large, cosmopolitan liverwort family Lophoziaceae is controversial. Many recent workers have included it in Jungermanniaceae, and even in its strictest sense, internal classification has varied widely among different treatments. We analyse variation in DNA sequences of the chloroplast rps4 gene and the trnG intron to provide resolution of phylogenetic relationships in the leafy liverworts with emphasis on the various elements usually placed in Lophoziaceae. The following conclusions are drawn. Lophoziaceae is not closely related to Jungermanniaceae. Lophoziaceae, and perhaps also Cephaloziellaceae, should be included in Scapaniaceae unless many small families are recognised. Delavayella and Blepharidophyllum are excluded from Scapaniaceae. Jamesonielloideae is a family of its own (Jamesoniellaceae) sister to Adelanthaceae (or a subfamily of Adelanthaceae). The genus Anastrophyllum should be split into Anastrophyllum and Sphenolobus. Lophozia is polyphyletic and the genera Isopaches and Schistochilopsis, and perhaps Obtusifolium, should be recognised while L. sudetica could be transferred to Barbilophozia. Barbilophozia s.str. is monophyletic while Orthocaulis is polyphyletic with the four sampled species appearing in 3 different clades; their relationships are poorly resolved. Lophozia silvicola Buch is clearly separated from L. ventricosa and Jamesoniella oenops from J. colorata at species level.
25065790|Phylogenetic analyses of taxa that have been included in the tribe Paederieae are performed on the basis of a molecular dataset of plastid DNA sequences (the rbcL gene, rps16 intron, and the regions trnT-F). The paraphyly of Paederieae as currently circumscribed is confirmed. A clade comprising Paederia, Spermadictyon, Leptodermis, and Serissa is retrieved and the circumscription of Paederieae is proposed to be restricted to this clade. Paederia is sister to a clade with Spermadictyon, Leptodermis, and Serissa. Paederia is subdivided into an Asian and an African clade, and within the African clade seven species endemic to Madagascar are sister to P. pospischilii in north-eastern Africa. The position of Kelloggia as sister to Rubieae is confirmed and a position of Saprosma in the Spermacoceae alliance is supported. The genera Putoria, Gaillonia (with segregates), Plocama, and Aitchisonia form a clade that is sister to Theligoneae/Kelloggia/Rubieae. The name Putorieae is resurrected for the members of this clade. A synopsis of Putorieae is provided, where all species are placed in an expanded Plocama with 34 species. Thirty-one new combinations in Plocama are proposed. Plocama pendula on the Canary Islands is strongly supported as sister to a clade with P. crocyllis (former Crocyllis) in southern Africa and P. yemenensis and P. tinctoria (former Gaillonia) in southern Arabia/Horn of Africa.
25065791|We present a hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships in Planchonella (Sapotaceae, Chrysophylloideae) using nrDNA (ITS) data analysed with parsimony jackknifing and Bayesian inference. Results from these two approaches yield similar majority-rule consensus trees. Planchonella (formerly included in Pouteria) is a monophyletic genus of trees and shrubs with 60 species currently recognised. They are distributed in Australia (13 spp.), New Caledonia (32 spp.), the Pacific islands (10 spp.), and New Guinea (5 spp.), but more molecular research is needed in order to identify all members in New Guinea and Malesia. Three strongly supported clades and several subclades were recovered by our analysis. Two clades are restricted to New Caledonia. Within these are eight recently discovered species that are described here (P. crenata, P. glauca, P. latihila, P. luteocostata, P. mandjeliana, P. povilana, P. roseoloba, P. rufocostata), each with a conservation assessment. Our molecular phylogeny shows that some of these taxa, initially believed to be conspecific or closely related, represent separate lineages that deserve species rank. Two of these species are restricted to areas with near-future mining activities, which is why urgent conservation assessments are needed. Several subspecies or varieties of P. myrsinifolia and P. cotinifolia are recognised in Australia. Neither of these two species is monophyletic in its present circumscription, and for this reason P. cotinifolia var. pubescens is given species rank here as P. pubescens. We also amend the generic description of Planchonella, a genus best distinguished on a character combination of stamens positioned just below (rarely in) the tube orifice, a multi-seeded fruit, and foliaceous cotyledons embedded in endosperm.
25065792|Phylogenetic relationships among Pteridaceae were established using rbcL sequences, parsimony and posterior probabilities. The analyses involved 38 Pteridaceae species native in Brazil (12 of them endemic) and 81 species of Dennstaedtiaceae, Lindsaeaceae, Saccolomataceae (outgroups) and Pteridaceae. The resultant phylogeny comprehends five main clades: Platyzomatoideae-Pteridoideae-Taenitoideae; Ceratopteris-Acrostichum; Adiantoideae-vittarioids; Cheilanthoideae; Coniogramme-Cryptogramma-Llavea. The cladograms support the most recent classification of Pteridaceae and demonstrate the paraphyly of Cheilanthoideae and the unnaturalness of Ceratopteridoideae, Platyzomatoideae, Pteridoideae, and Taenitidoideae as traditionally defined. Adiantoideae can only be recognized if combined with the vittarioids. Several genera of Pteridaceae appear to be paraphyletic (e.g., as Cheilanthes, Doryopteris, Pellaea, Pteris), and new generic affinities suggested by consistent internal clades are proposed.
25065793|Nucleotide sequences of the chloroplast rbcL and trnL-F regions were determined for 33 Asian species that bear on relationships of the cheilanthoid ferns. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses were conducted on separate and combined sequence datasets to gain insights into phylogenetic relationships and generic circumscriptions of these cheilanthoids, with the following results. (1) Doryopteris ludens is always placed far from its congeners. (2) In rbcL sequence analysis, the Old World species of Paragymnopteris K.H. Shing form a strongly supported clade with Pellaea; these taxa are separated into two subclades in phylogenetic trees. (3) Except Paragymnopteris, Doryopteris, and Pellaea calomelanos, all the Asian cheilanthoid species sampled are grouped together and distantly segregated from the American taxa of Cheilanthes, indicating that Cheilanthes sensu Tryon & al. is not monophyletic. (4) The recognition of Sinopteris, Leptolepidium, Cheilosoria, and Mildella is not supported. All Asian species of these four small genera are grouped together with Aleuritopteris in the ML and BI trees.
25065794|Menispermaceae (Moonseed family) are an important family within the basal eudicots. This study is a first attempt to infer phylogenetic relationships within Menispermaceae, focusing on morphological data and using cladistic methodology. Sampling included genera from all the eight tribes usually recognized within the family, and was representative of the morphological diversity and worldwide distribution of the group. Preliminary trees were poorly resolved and were optimized using Reduced Cladistic Consensus (RCC) and NoiseSnapper. The latter program was used for the first time in phylogeny. In addition, fossils of the Eocene of the Paris Basin were included in the analysis. All three approaches were useful as they allowed for improvement of resolution. None of the tribes were found to be monophyletic except Menispermeae. We also show that fruit characters are unreliable and should not be used for classification.
25065795|The impact of Pleistocene climatic fluctuations on the distributions of plant species in the Greater Cape Floristic Region is largely unknown. We used a molecular fingerprinting tool, inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) PCR to examine the spatial distribution of genetic variation in the common and widespread shrub Elytropappus rhinocerotis. We wished to test the hypothesis that refugia for the species were located in areas which were buffered from marked variations in precipitation between glacial and interglacial periods. Populations from less protected areas, in contrast, should have suffered size reductions or extinctions during the dry Holocene optimum. We detected a large amount of genetic variation in the species, which was apportioned largely amongst individuals within populations rather than amongst populations or regions, as expected for an outcrossing and well-dispersed plant species. However, there was significant spatial structure and an uneven distribution of diversity across the range. Geographic distance is a very poor predictor of genetic distance between localities, especially towards the east of the range. This may be due to range alteration over the time-scale reflected by ISSR polymorphism. Inter-SSR variation declined from south to north in the western arm of the range, consistent with the prediction of Holocene aridification starting first and being most extreme in the north. Areas shown by the marker to harbour populations with high levels of variability include most parts of the eastern arm of the range, and the Kamiesberg highlands. Possible explanations for the observed patterns of ISSR variation are discussed.
25065796|We investigated patterns of genetic variation within and among the eight extant populations of the genus Abies in the western Mediterranean Basin. Using six chloroplast microsatellite (cpSSR) loci, a total of 22 alleles and 34 haplotypes was found among 225 individuals. The analyzed populations showed high levels of genetic diversity (mean $H_{{\rm e}}=0.84$). Two clearly separated main groups corresponding to the three Spanish and the five Moroccan populations, respectively, were distinguished. A phylogeographic signal was evident and a Mantel test revealed a strong positive correlation between geographic and genetic distances of the eight populations. Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) assigned 85% of the total genetic variation to differences between continents. Within each continent, populations were remarkably little differentiated with the exception of one highly divergent Moroccan stand; the origin of this divergence requires further investigation. Our results document a strong effect of the Strait of Gibraltar on Abies differentiation in this region, whereas the high diversity within and the low differentiation among populations on each side point to a certain level of pollen-mediated gene flow among the extant stands. On the other hand, our analysis indicates that the population formerly assigned to the species A. tazaotana is, in fact, genetically very close to most A. marocana stands. We discuss implications of the observed population structures for conservation and management of West Mediterranean Abies taxa.
25065797|Reticulate evolution, whether due to lateral gene transfer, introgression, incomplete lineage sorting, or hybrid speciation, is a ubiquitous phenomenon, yet systematists have few tools for analyzing and summarizing the resulting genealogical discordance. Here I argue that a primary concordance tree, a tree built from clades that are true of a plurality of the genome, provides a useful summary of the dominant phylogenetic history for a group of organisms. Residual historical signals can also be extracted in the form of secondary, tertiary, etc. concordance trees, which are built from clades that are present in the genome but contradict clades on the primary concordance tree. Clades on concordance trees can be annotated with their concordance factor (CF), the proportion of the genome for which the clade is true. Concordance trees can potentially be estimated either from population histories or from multilocus molecular datasets. In the latter case one can use the recently developed Bayesian concordance analysis to obtain point estimates and credibility intervals on CF's. I argue that the concepts of concordance trees and concordance factors inform the debate on how to integrate information from multiple independent datasets and help clarify the nature of the boundary between reticulate and divergent genealogy.
25065798|Dipteronia dyerana is a rare endemic from south-eastern Yunnan Province (China) that is known from only five natural populations, two of which occur outside a nature reserve. To obtain base-line information of the population structure, history and conservation of the species, we investigated patterns of genetic diversity within and among all natural populations, in addition to an ex situ conserved population, using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) DNA markers. Across all populations surveyed, average within-population diversity was remarkably low (e.g., 0.088 for Nei's gene diversity), with populations from outside the nature reserve maintaining the highest amounts of genetic diversity. Among all natural populations, high genetic differentiation $(G_{{\rm ST}}=0.375)$ was detected, together with an isolation-by-distance pattern. Past habitat fragmentation, restricted gene flow and, to a lesser extent, genetic drift are proposed to be the determinant factors responsible for the low genetic diversity and high genetic differentiation observed, although reproductive-ecological factors, such as a mixed-mating system and low seedling recruitment due to inbreeding, might also play a role. We strongly recommend in situ conservation of those D. dyerana populations occurring outside the nature reserve, as they contain the highest proportion of the species' total ISSR fragment diversity, which might be eventually relevant for local adaptation. Our data further indicate that the ex situ conserved population insufficiently represents the genetic diversity present in the species. It is therefore suggested to sample at least four natural populations to cover a reasonable proportion (95%) of the species' genetic variation for ex situ conservation.
25065799|Acosmium Schott is a Neotropical genus of ca. 17 species of trees with non-papilionoid, actinomorphic flowers. It has been included in the genistoid clade (Leguminosae, Papilionoideae) in recent phylogenetic analyses. A morphology-based cladistic analysis was performed to test the currently assumed monophyly of Acosmium, assess the validity of the infrageneric classification of Yakovlev, and detect synapomorphies and other diagnostic characters in Acosmium and related taxa. Thirty-four species representing ten genera of subfamily Papilionoideae were included in the analysis: all accepted species of the four sections of Acosmium together with species of Bowdichia, Clathrotropis, Diplotropis, Bolusanthus, Cadia, Poecilanthe, Cyclolobium, and Ormosia; two species of Luetzelburgia were selected as outgroups. The results do not support the monophyly of Acosmium; the species of this genus fall into three distinct, not closely related clades that correspond to the sections of Acosmium established by Yakovlev except for sect. Mesitis that merges into sect. Leptolobium. We propose: (1) recognizing a narrowly circumscribed genus Acosmium; (2) reinstating the generic name Leptolobium Vogel, encompassing sections Leptolobium and Mesitis; and (3) segregating A. praeclarum (Sandwith) Yakovlev into a new genus, Guianodendron. The phylogenetic relevance of some new or neglected characters, especially from bud architecture, seed, and seedling morphology is emphasized.
25065800|Aeonium (Crassulaceae) comprises species that display a remarkable degree of morphological diversity, including rosette trees, candelabrum shrubs, highly branched shrubs, and woody rosettes. Greenhouse studies have documented that the genus is also diverse in basic photosynthetic metabolism, with ${\rm C}_{3}$, CAM, and ${\rm C}_{3}\text{-}{\rm CAM}$ intermediates present. However, the degree of photosynthetic diversity present in natural populations and between species has never been surveyed. We analyzed stable isotopes of carbon from field-collected species of Aeonium and confirmed that these species are diverse physiologically. Using these data, each species sampled was coded as CAM, ${\rm C}_{3}$, or intermediate. This trait was optimized using parsimony onto one arbitrarily selected cladogram for Macaronesian Crassulaceae that had been previously published. These analyses indicated that the ancestral physiological condition for the entire Macaronesian clade of Crassulaceae is ${\rm C}_{3}$ photosynthesis. Within Aeonium, one subclade consists largely of species with obligate CAM, one is exclusively intermediate, and two subclades are more variable in photosynthetic metabolism. The ancestral character state for the Aeonium clade is equivocal when the intermediate carbon isotope values were coded as a third character state; however, when these intermediates are considered polymorphic (i.e., facultative CAM), ${\rm C}_{3}$ photosynthesis also was ancestral in Aeonium. Concentrated changes tests were conducted to explore associations between CAM and three growth-form attributes, including the candelabrum shrub and rosette tree growth-forms and monocarpy. These tests revealed no significant association between CAM and monocarpy. The candelabrum shrub growth-form is also not linked with CAM, but CAM has evolved twice within taxa displaying this growth-form. In contrast, the hypothesized correlation between CAM and the rosette tree growth-form was neither rejected nor supported.
25065801|First molecular phylogenies of Hoya failed to reveal many intrageneric relationships, emphasizing the need to find additional phylogenetic characters. Thirty-five species, covering the morphological and geographic variation of Hoya, were examined using light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Thirteen phylogenetically informative characters were scored and studied in the light of an available phylogenetic tree. Species attributed to the Acanthostemma-group share pollinaria with obliquely elongate pollinia on broad-winged caudicles, synapomorphies that also link H. anulata and H. lacunosa to this group, the latter found in a disparate position in the phylogenetic tree. The pollinaria of H. sussuela fit well with those of the other species of section Eriostemma in having pollinia with twisted caudicles, a square corpusculum, and without pellucid margins. The absence of pellucid margins on the pollinia is also characteristic of H. mitrata and H. darwinii. Australian/New Guinean species generally have obovate pollinia basally protruding outwards and thick rhomboid corpuscula, supporting a monophyletic Australian/New Guinean clade, as suggested by phylogenetic studies. Hoya australis from Australia and H. albiflora from New Guinea have identical pollinaria indicating the possibility that these taxa are conspecific, as also shown in the phylogenetic tree. Several of the examined characters of the pollinaria of Hoya are useful in inferring phylogenetic relationships, indicating the utility of pollinarium morphology in this genus.
25065802|A new method for working with morphological characters is described and explored in experiments using human participants. The method uses direct comparison and sorting of images to produce hierarchical character-cladograms. A character-cladogram is a graphical representation of a single character that serves as a hypothesis of phylogeny based on that character. Each dichotomy in the character-cladogram represents a character state. Character states are unnamed, thus avoiding problems that arise through the application of verbal labels. Experiments with human participants are used to explore the conditions under which direct comparison produces reliable (consistent from investigator to investigator) and valid (in agreement with an independent estimate of phylogeny) characters. Participants were drawn from students taking a course in plant diversity at UNC Greensboro, and professional plant morphologists attending the Botany 2004 meetings. The students were randomly assigned to trained and untrained groups. Training was carried out using a method that has been shown to change a participant's mode of visual processing from analytic (the mode used by visual novices) to holistic (an additional mode only employed by visual experts). Morphologists (no specialists of the taxonomic group) were included in the study to investigate the effects of disciplinary expertise on the ability to describe character-cladograms. They received no additional training beyond that available to them as disciplinary experts. The results suggest an improvement in both reliability and validity after the training regime. We found no support for the idea that the morphologists differed from untrained students in their ability to produce reliable or valid character-cladograms. Disciplinary expertise may not translate into the ability to make reliable and valid assessments of similarity in an unfamiliar visual domain. Based on these results, we suggest a method for creating morphological characters and character states.
25065803|This paper presents PCR primers and PCR conditions for low-copy nuclear genes in Ophrys and related orchid genera identified via screening of both published and newly designed primers. For Ophrys, the most useful markers identified in this screen are the LFY/FLO gene which contains an intron of 2 kb size and the MADS-box PI/GLO gene whose 2 first introns contain single nucleotide polymorphisms with variation at the populational level. In the taxa tested, our PCR primers amplified single-copy regions. Phylogenetic analysis of closely related taxa of Ophrys section Pseudophrys, based on LFY, revealed the following groups that are delimited by morphology: O. lutea s.l.; O. omegaifera s.l. with O. iricolor nested in this group; the two O. fusca s.l. taxa, O. leucadica and O. bilunulata; and the O. fusca s.l. taxon O. cinereophila together with a group of endemics from Crete.
25065804|To facilitate the construction of online determination aids from existing plain text dichotomous analytical keys, a software tool is presented for the quick conversion of such keys into HTML code. The resulting HTML documents can be navigated with hyperlinks, and it is possible to set hyperlinks from the taxa to other online resources. The program is accessible online at http://www.sysbot.uni-goettingen.de/key2html/key2html.html.
25065805|Studies of organelle DNA sequence at low taxonomic levels present a researcher with specific experimental design challenges. Such studies require sampling numerous individuals, many of which share identical haplotypes. The process is often limited by the time and money required for DNA sequencing. A number of screening techniques have been devised to combat this limitation, but many have not found wide-spread use in botany. An ideal screening technique would be fast, easy, safe, inexpensive, detect 100% of mutations, be suitable for DNA fragments of about 1 kb, and not require complex equipment. This paper compares the heteroduplex analysis (HA) and chemical cleavage of mismatch (CCM) methods for detecting known point mutations and a deletion in a 1 kb region of non-coding cpDNA from the Poa pratensis agg. A new CCM visualization method, staining with SYBR Green II, was tested.
25065806|The Mediterranean species of Plocama (incl. Putoria) are revised and two species, the widespread P. calabrica, comb. nov., and P. brevifolia, comb. nov., in Morocco and Algeria, are recognized. The variation and circumscription of the species are discussed and distribution maps are provided. Several names are reduced to synonymy and seven lectotypes are designated.
25065807|Taxonomic features of Panicum discrepans, previously classified in subg. Agrostoides, sect. Discrepantia of Panicum, are reviewed and compared with other taxa in Paniceae. The new genus Cyphonanthus is proposed on the basis of morphological and molecular characters to include a species distributed from the Caribbean and Mesoamerica to Brazil and Bolivia. Affinities of the new genus with other genera of Paniceae are also discussed.
25065808|The Drosera omissa/D. nitidula complex is revised. Drosera omissa is reinstated and found to be conspecific with D. ericksoniae, which is reduced to synonymy. The taxon corresponding to the type of D. nitidula is determined and D. allantostigma and D. leucostigma are elevated from subspecific to specific rank. Drosera patens (known previously as D. nitidula subsp. 'omissa' and D. nitidula 'var.?') is described as a new species. All five species are compared morphologically, described and illustrated. Cytological investigation found all species to have chromosome numbers of n=14 and 2n=28, suggesting a base number of x=7 for the complex.
25065809|The authors citation for family treatments and the correct author citation for new names in volumes 1 through 3 of the 21-volume "Flora Yunnanica" was not adequately explained at the time of publication. Although this information and the role of Wu Zhengyi (C.Y. Wu) is explained in later volumes, some of this information is only given in Chinese. As it is necessary to know this information when using these new names in subsequent publications, an account of the correct authorship of all new names in volumes 1-3 of "Flora Yunnanica" is provided here.
25065810|A century ago Gothan described fossil woods from the Arctic and established several new species and genera that were subsequently widely used. The type material has, however, never been reviewed. Investigations in Berlin and Stockholm resulted in the re-location of the original material which allows us to propose lectotypifications for the names of six species recognized by Gothan, three of which represent types of Gothan's generic names, Anomaloxylon, Protocedroxylon, and Protopiceoxylon. The types (holotypes or lectotypes) are illustrated here, some of them for the first time with micrographs. Taxonomic investigation of Gothan's species with "Abietineentpfelungen", an anatomical feature of ray cells, suggests that Cedroxylon transiens and Anomaloxylon magnoradiatum should be regarded as taxonomic synonyms of Protocedroxylon araucarioides, and Cedroxylon cedroides as a taxonomic synonym of Protopiceoxylon exstinctum.
25065811|Clarification in the Tokyo Code of the authorship of names appearing in the work of another allowed exemplification in the Vienna Code that it is the acceptance by the author of the name and not that by the publishing author that is critical for valid publication. This permits resolution of a long-standing uncertainty as to whether generic names published in Acharius's "Lichenographia Universalis" of 1810 were or were not first introduced in Luyken's Tentamen Historiae Lichenum of 1809. In that work, Luyken reproduced diagnoses of Acharius's new genera while the Lichenographia was still in press, and 5-6 months before Acharius's work was published. However, as Luyken did not accept the new genera in his final classification some workers had considered the names not validly published under Art. 34 of the Code. Now, following the Vienna Code, we conclude that these names were validly published in 1809 and must be attributed to "Ach., in Luyken". The correct place and date of publication of the ten generic names involved is presented along with notes on their nomenclatural status; these include the well-known genera Alectoria, Evernia, Lecanora, Nephroma, and Ramalina.
25065812|The classification of the Southern Hemisphere Veronica complex is discussed in the light of recent findings that these segregate genera are nested within the hitherto northern Veronica clade. In order to render Veronica monophyletic, we transfer Chionohebe, Derwentia, Detzneria, Hebe, Hebejeebie, Heliohebe, Leonohebe, and Parahebe to Veronica subgen. Pseudoveronica. Correct names are listed for all species in Veronica subgen. Pseudoveronica, according to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. Those species previously included in Derwentia together with other Australian species of Veronica are now classified in Veronica sect. Labiatoides, that in Detzneria is now classified in Veronica sect. Detzneria, and those in Chionohebe, Hebe, Heliohebe, Leonohebe, and Parahebe are now classified in Veronica sect. Hebe. Seventy-nine nomenclatural changes are provided: 61 new combinations (1 at section rank, 37 at species rank, 23 below species rank) and 18 new names (including 1 new name for a northern Veronica from the Caucasus).
25065813|While preparing a revision of Parasenecio W.W. Sm. & J. Small (Compositae) from China, we found that "Parasenecio morrisonensis Y.L. Chen" was not a validly published name because it was wrongly regarded as a replacement name (nomen novum), and thus no Latin diagnosis was given and no type was indicated, whereas it was actually the name of a new taxon that had been previously misidentified as Cacalia monantha auct. non (Diels) Hayata (cf Art. 33 Note 2 of the ICBN). Parasenecio morrisonensis is validly published here by giving a Latin diagnosis and designating a holotype.
25065815|Bauhinia emarginata Roxb. ex G. Don (1832), non Mill. (1768), nec Jack (1822) has been found to be conspecific with B. retusa Roxb. (1832), non Poir. (1811). So B. roxburghiana Voigt (1845) ( B. emarginata Roxb. ex G. Don), the first available name for this Old World species of Bauhinia, is reinstated here, setting aside B. semla Wunderlin (1976) ( B. retusa Roxb.), which is also found to be an illegitimate name.
10.2307/25065850|Hybridization and polyploidization are now recognized as major phenomena in the evolution of plants, promoting genetic diversity, adaptive radiation and speciation. Modern molecular techniques have recently provided evidence that allopolyploidy can induce several types of genetic and epigenetic events that are of critical importance for the evolutionary success of these plants: (1) chromosomal rearrangements within one or both parental genomes contribute toward proper meiotic pairing and isolation of the hybrid from its progenitors; (2) demethylation and activation of dormant transposable elements may trigger insertional mutagenesis and changes in local patterns of gene expression, facilitating rapid genomic reorganization; (3) rapid and reproducible loss of low copy DNA sequences appears to result in further differentiation of homoeologous chromosomes; and (4) organ-specific up- or down-regulation of one of the duplicated genes, may result in unequal expression or silencing one copy. All these alterations also have the potential, while stabilizing allopolyploid genomes, to produce novel expression patterns and new phenotypes, which together with increased heterozygosity and gene redundancy might confer on allopolyploids an elevated evolutionary potential, with effects at scales ranging from molecular to ecological. Although important advances have been made in understanding genomic responses to allopolyploidization, further insights are still expected to be gained in the near future, such as the direction and nature of the diploidization process, functional relevance of gene expression alterations, molecular mechanisms that result in adaptation to different ecologies/habitats, and ecological and evolutionary implications of recurrent polyploidization.
10.2307/25065853|Recent focus on plant-insect associations during the angiosperm radiation from the last 30 million years of the Early Cretaceous has inadvertently de-emphasized a similar but earlier diversification that occurred among gymnosperms. The existence of gymnosperm-insect associations during the preangiospermous Mesozoic is evidenced by mouthparts capable of reaching and imbibing pollination drops or similar fluids, availability of pollen types consistent with entomophily, and opportunities for related consumption of pollen, seeds, and reproductively associated tissues in major seed-plant groups, namely seed ferns, conifers, cycads, bennettitaleans, and gnetaleans. Based on stereotypical plant damage, head-adherent pollen, gut contents, wing structure, mouthpart morphology and insect damage to plant reproductive organs, the likely nectarivores, pollinivores and pollinators were orthopterans, phasmatodeans, webspinners, sawflies and wasps, moths, beetles, mecopteroids, and true flies. These associations are ranked from possible to probable although the last three insect clades provide the strongest evidence for pollinator activity. We document two mid Cretaceous examples of these associations-cycadeoideaceous bennettitaleans and beetles and a cheirolepidiaceous conifer and flies-for which there are multiple lines of evidence for insect consumption of plant reproductive tissues but also pollination mutualisms. These data highlight the independent origin of a major phase of plant-insect pollinator-related associations during the mid Mesozoic that served as a prelude for the separate, iterative and later colonization of angiosperms.
10.2307/25065854|In the Republic of Panam, phytophagous beetles were collected by hand and beating from superficially similar generalist blossoms of Nectandra umbrosa (Lauraceae) and Tapirira guianensis (Anacardiaceae), two phylogenetically distant Neotropical canopy trees. Beetles were sorted into three functional groups (guilds): general flower visitors, species developing in buds, and seed predators. Out of a total of 1,564 collected specimens belonging to 177 beetle species, 55 species or 31% were identifiable to specific epithet. These small- to medium-sized beetles belonged to four families: Cerambycidae, Chrysomelidae, Brentidae, and Curculionidae. A total of 723 beetles representing 121 species, and 841 beetles representing 121 species were recorded from N. umbrosa and T. guianensis, respectively. Of the beetles collected, 65 species were common to both trees, which equates to a similarity index value of 0.46 (Jaccard) or 0.34 (Srensen). With respect to functional groups, there was no significant difference in the number of beetle species between the two tree species. Overall, beetle abundance patterns on flowers of the two trees are similar in terms of phytophagous beetle subfamily dominance. There are differences however, significantly more leaf beetles (Cryptocephalinae, Eumolpinae, Galerucinae) were collected per hour on T. guianensis than on N. umbrosa. Moreover, among beetles shared between the two tree species, Baridinae weevils showed a tendency to be more abundant on N. umbrosa. Nearly three-quarters of the flower feeders (72%) were shared between the two trees. The large overlap in beetle species between the two plant species suggests that the fauna is fairly general in terms of host use. We discuss the possible significance of our results to phytophagous beetle and host plant evolution. The combined effects of large species numbers, high abundance and broad diet breadth across generalist flowers of tropical canopy trees suggests that small- to medium-sized beetles play a crucial role in maintenance of species biodiversity and forest ecosystem function.
10.2307/25065855|Since Delpino (1868-74) recognized that flowers sharing similar physiognomies are preferentially visited by certain groups of animals, it has been commonly inferred that these biological groups (flowers and pollinators) have passed a more or less complicated evolutionary process of mutual specialization. The question, however, as to what were the initial angiosperm floral forms remains unanswered. Whatever the form, a broad spectrum of visitors was likely. Each organism needs to be adapted to its environment, for which reason the term "generalized" instead of "non-specialized" is to be preferred. Generalized flowers occur even in otherwise highly evolved families, suggesting that these representatives have developed secondarily from a somewhat specialized pollination type; this points to the fact that "generalized" and "specialized" are relative terms. It also means that a generalized flower is not synonymous with a "primitive flower"! In terms of morphology, the original "primitive flower" form is a subject of debate. Neither in the fossil records nor among extant, archaic angiosperms is there a model organism bearing a flower with a broad spectrum of visitors, and which exhibits all organs in their plesiomorphic state. Nor is it likely that such a plant will ever be discovered. Thus, we must be content with a relative solution; there is one-hitherto only one-magnolioid family, the Winteraceae, some members of which approach the idealized model. Representatives of this family are characterized by many plesiomorphic features and have open flowers visited by a broad spectrum of pollen vectors. An explanation of how these plants could have remained in this generalized condition over long time periods is offered.
10.2307/25065856|The concept of a generalist flower appears to mean different things to different people, depending upon their background and training. We assess the different meanings of generalist flowers with respect to the ecological "set and setting" of pollination, and then we discuss notions of ecological, functional and phenotypic generalization. These ideas are explored in more detail using examples from our own published and unpublished studies on the pollination ecology of Daucus carota, Hedera helix, and Chamerion angustifolium, and from the published work of other researchers. Finally we relate these ideas and clarified definitions of "generalist" and "specialist" flowers to the pollination syndrome concept.
10.2307/25065857|Using a sample of 1,403 flowering plant species, we tested the hypothesis that flower openness and flower-visitor generalization level of a plant species correlate positively. The "flower-visitor generalization level" $L_{{\rm n}}$ of a flowering plant species n, here defined as number of flower-visiting animal species attracted to the flowers of n in a given study site, varied enormously among plant species. Its frequency distribution was extremely skewed. Within a study site, L also increased with number of flower-visitor species A. In order to correct for this, we expressed L relatively, as the proportion of the total flower-visitor fauna in a study site that visited a given plant species (relative generalization level, L/A). We listed the top-10 most generalized species (both according to L and L/A) in the "world", i.e., out of our sample of 1,403 plant species. Flower openness is defined as accessibility to the interior of the flower. We placed the blossom classes of Fgri & van der Pijl along a gradient, albeit not very well defined, of decreasing flower openness (dish-bowl, bell-funnel, head-brush, tube, gullet, flag) and tested for any relationship to their generalization level. The classes differed slightly but significantly in their level of L/A. Tube, bell-funnel, and dish-bowl had the highest generalization level and flag, gullet, and head-brush the lowest. Thus, flower openness and generalization level were not correlated. We discuss other factors influencing generalization level such as accessibility to pollen and nectar, morphology and behavior of visitor, and species diversity of the different functional types of visitors.
10.2307/25065858|We present a phylogeny for Mesembryanthemoideae (Aizoaceae) based on sampling of nearly all species and subspecies of the subfamily and analysis of cptrnL-F, rbcL-atpB, rps16, nrITS1 and morphology. The larger genera Phyllobolus and Mesembryanthemum are not monophyletic. Although some clades can be circumscribed with morphological (often homoplasious) synapomorphies, several clades are impossible to characterise morphologically. We recognise a single genus, Mesembryanthemum, in Mesembryanthemoideae. The genera Aptenia, Aridaria, Aspazoma, Brownanthus, Caulipsolon, Dactylopsis, Phyllobolus, Prenia, Psilocaulon, Sceletium, and Synaptophyllum are reduced to synonymy. Mesembryanthemum, which now consists of 101 species without recognised sections, can be distinguished by several uniquely derived morphological characters. Mesembryanthemum longipapillosum, which had recently been reduced to synonymy, is reinstated.
10.2307/25065859|Guatteria (Annonaceae) is with ca. 265 species one of the largest genera of Neotropical trees together with Inga and Ocotea. Use of Guatteria in evolutionary studies has been hampered by taxonomic problems caused by lack of morphological variability in the genus. This study focuses on molecular phylogenetic relationships within Guatteria and its satellites Guatteriopsis, Guatteriella and Heteropetalum, and implications of these relationships for classification and character evolution. Results show that Guatteriopsis, Guatteriella and Heteropetalum should be merged with Guatteria. Heteropetalum may be recognized at subgeneric level because of its aberrant morphology and Guatteriopsis and Guatteriella might be given sectional status. Most of the currently recognised sections in Guatteria are probably non-monophyletic. A completely new infrageneric classification of Guatteria would be premature, however, due to the lack of molecular and morphological synapomorphies to define the sections. Synapomorphies defining Guatteria s.str. probably evolved after divergence of several early branching lineages.
10.2307/25065860|A phylogenetic study of the genus Polycarpon was made using DNA sequence data from the chloroplast rps16 intron and nuclear RPB2 regions. Polycarpon as currently recognised is shown to be polyphyletic. The South American species P. coquimbense and P. suffruticosum are more closely related to Haya obovata (Socotra) and Polycarpaea spicata (paleotropical) than to the remaining species of Polycarpon, and the widespread tropical species P. prostratum is nested with Macaronesian species of Polycarpaea. All three should therefore be excluded from Polycarpon. The remaining species, the P. tetraphyllum group, has its main diversity in the Mediterranean region. It is a polyploid complex with morphologically very similar taxa mostly separated only by partially overlapping characters. The members of this group form a strongly supported, but largely unresolved clade. It is proposed that they are all included in a widely circumscribed P. tetraphyllum. The dehiscence of the capsules in P. tetraphyllum, by valves that elastically roll inwards and finally throw out the seeds, is unique in Caryophyllaceae and provides a strong synapomorphy for Polycarpon in this new restricted sense.
10.2307/25065861|Craspedia (Asteraceae: Gnaphalieae) is a genus of 23 species found only in Australia and New Zealand. Maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses of ITS and ETS intergenic spacers from the nuclear genome recovered three main lineages. The first lineage consists solely of the Australian species C. haplorrhiza, the relationships of which are unresolved, and the second includes species that are also exclusively Australian in distribution. The third lineage comprises two monophyletic groups; one including all the remaining Australian species sampled and the other, all New Zealand entities sampled. Monophyly of New Zealand Craspedia is also supported by analysis of psbA-trnH intergenic spacer sequences. Australian alpine species are independently derived from within the two larger Australian lineages. Both major Australian lineages are present in Tasmania suggesting multiple colonisations from mainland Australia. The single lineage of New Zealand Craspedia and the low divergences between Australian and New Zealand Craspedia samples are consistent with the derivation of New Zealand Craspedia via a single dispersal event from south-east Australia in the Late Tertiary or Quaternary. Compared with Australian Craspedia, the New Zealand species show extensive morphological divergence but little sequence divergence, suggesting a recent and rapid species radiation.
10.2307/25065862|A phylogenetic analysis based on a combined dataset of three genes, nuclear 18S rDNA and plastid rbcL and atpB, indicates that the enigmatic Neotropical genus Metteniusa is a member of the lamiid (euasterid I) clade. The genus appears as an isolated taxon near, but perhaps not related exclusively to, Oncothecaceae, which supports its recognition as a separate family.
10.2307/25065863|Fifty-three species of Boophone Herb., Ammocharis Herb., Cybistetes Milne-Redh. and Crinum L. were analysed cladistically using nuclear ITS and plastid trnL-F sequences, with Amaryllis belladonna L. as an outgroup. Boophone disticha (L.f.) Herb. is sister to the subtribe Crininae (i.e., Crinum, Ammocharis, Cybistetes). Two main clades were revealed in the Crininae. The first comprises Ammocharis, Crinum baumii Harms and Cybistetes longifolia Milne-Redh. & Schweick. Cybistetes longifolia appears in a sister relationship to Ammocharis angolensis (Baker) Milne-Redh. & Schweick. Crinum baumii and Cybistetes longifolia are thus both referred to the genus Ammocharis under the names Ammocharis baumii (Harms) Milne-Redh. and Ammocharis longifolia (L.) Roem. respectively. The second main clade is constituted by all other examined species of Crinum, and is split into four subclades. The first subclade includes populations of the newly discovered Zambian species, C. jasonii Bjor & Nordal (2006), which has bell-shaped flowers. The second subclade comprises all species with star-shaped flowers ("Stenaster") occurring in the southern and eastern part of Africa, Madagascar, and Australasia. The Angolan "Codonocrinum" (i.e., with bell-shaped flowers), C. fimbriatulum Baker, is in a sister relationship to this subclade. The third subclade includes species with bell-shaped flowers with main distribution in southern Africa, in addition to the Australian C. flaccidum Herb. The fourth subclade includes North African and tropical species with bell-shaped flowers including Asiatic taxa. A monophyletic group with star-shaped flowers distributed in West Africa and America is nested within this subclade. Interestingly, a narrowly endemic species, C. binghamii Nordal & Kwembeya, occurring in swamps in western Zambia is sister to this "western Stenaster" group. There is no support for the taxonomic recognition of subgeneric delimitation based on flower morphology. On the other hand, there are strong geographical and ecological trends in the phylogeny.
10.2307/25065864|The subfamily Thalictroideae, which is clearly defined by its chromosome characters, contains nine or ten genera. Here we use sequences of chloroplast rbcL and matK genes as well as non-coding trnL-F and nuclear ITS regions to reconstruct the generic level phylogeny of this subfamily. Our data recognize three major groups within Thalictroideae: (1) Thalictrum, Leptopyrum, Paropyrum, and Paraquilegia; (2) Urophysa, Semiaquilegia, and Aquilegia; and (3) Dichocarpum, Enemion, and Isopyrum. Isopyrum anemonoides, the sole species of Paropyrum, and Paraquilegia form a clade sister to Leptopyrum; together they make up the first group. Isopyrum manshuricum and I. thalictroides form another clade within the third group. Isopyrum anemonoides is sister to the monophyletic Paraquilegia. Our data suggest that Isopyrum is polyphyletic and support the segregate genus Paropyrum. Reconstruction of petal evolution suggests a secondary loss of petals in Enemion and Thalictrum, in contrast with the view that apetalous taxa are the most primitive. Petals with longer stalks in Dichocarpum are shown to be derivative, refuting the viewpoint that this type is a primitive condition. The flat petals in Paraquilegia may be derived from the tubular-type petals in Paropyrum and Leptopyrum, and spurred petals are thought to have originated from a single ancestor.
10.2307/25065865|This is an abbreviated version of a paper that appears in full in the Electronic supplement to Taxon. Phylogenetic definitions are provided for the names of 20 clades of vascular plants (plus 33 others in the electronic supplement). Emphasis has been placed on well-supported clades that are widely known to non-specialists and/or have a deep origin within Tracheophyta or Angiospermae. These treatments follow the draft PhyloCode and illustrate the application of phylogenetic nomenclature in a variety of nomenclatural and phylogenetic contexts. Phylogenetic nomenclature promotes precision in distinguishing crown, apomorphy-based, and total clades, thereby improving communication about character evolution and divergence times. To make these distinctions more transparent without increasing the number of entirely different names that must be learned, the following naming conventions (which have been adopted in the most recent draft of the PhyloCode) are employed here: widely known names are applied to crown clades, and the corresponding total clade (i.e., crown plus stem) is named "Pan-X", where "X" is the name of the crown (e.g., Pan-Spermatophyta for the total clade of plants that share more recent ancestry with extant seed plants than with any other crown clade). If a name "X" that is based etymologically on an apomorphy is applied to the crown, the name "Apo-X" is applied to the clade for which this trait is synapomorphic (e.g., Apo-Spermatophyta for the clade originating from the first plant with seeds). Crown clade names can be defined by three kinds of definitions, two of which are used here: standard node-based and branch-modified node-based. The latter is particularly useful when outgroup relationships of a crown clade are better known than basal relationships within the clade. Criteria and approaches used here to choose among competing preexisting names for a clade, to select a definition type, to choose appropriate specifiers, and (in some cases) to restrict the use of a name to certain phylogenetic contexts may be widely applicable when naming other clades. The phylogenetic definitions proposed here should help focus future discussions of the PhyloCode on real definitions rather than simplified hypothetical ones.
10.2307/25065866|Statistical methods are proposed for analyzing the experimental design, preliminary results, and final results of phylogenetic studies of organelle DNA sequence at low taxonomic levels. Such studies require sampling numerous individuals, many of which share identical haplotypes. The proportions of the haplotypes sampled can help answer the following questions: (1) Is one haplotype so dominant that the particular DNA region is without meaningful variation within the scope of the study? (2) Were all prevalent haplotypes found? (3) What are the proportions of each haplotype within the studied group? (4) What percentage of the studied group can be confidently asserted to belong to the haplotypes that were found? Examples are given in which the statistics techniques are applied to data drawn from the botanical literature. Tables are included as a quick reference for the researcher who wishes to circumvent calculation. A Microsoft Excel 2000 spreadsheet (titled "HaploPro.xls") for performing some of the more complicated calculations is offered online. Finally, the limitations of these methods and their applicability to nuclear DNA and other characters studies are discussed.
10.2307/25065867|We gathered morphological and genetic evidence for introgressive patterns in Gentianella stiriaca, a taxon thought to have resulted from reticulate relationships between two or three species (G. aspera, G. austriaca, G. rhaetica). Multivariate analyses including morphometric and classical differential characters were poorly resolving and showed that G. stiriaca was mostly distributed within G. rhaetica and G. aspera. Using only the categorical classical differential characters, three well-separated morphological groups (G. aspera, G. austriaca, G. rhaetica) were identified, however, with half of the G. stiriaca samples close to G. rhaetica. In contrast, AFLP data revealed several groups that were not concordant with morphological groups. Neighbour Joining, PCoA and Bayesian admixture analysis (BAPS) each identified a northeastern gene pool of G. aspera including northern samples of G. stiriaca, and a southeastern gene pool of G. rhaetica including southeastern G. stiriaca. Both gene pools show some admixture from G. austriaca. The genetic data support an old hypothesis of multiple hybrid origin and introgressive processes in the evolution of G. stiriaca. We discuss the effect of Pleistocene climate changes on the patterns of variation and introgression in Gentianella. We consider "G. stiriaca" a polytopic variant that does not deserve specific rank. Following the morphological species concept we propose including it in G. rhaetica to which it is most similar.
10.2307/25065868|A recent molecular analysis of the Colchicaceae has revealed that the genus Androcymbium is paraphyletic in relation to Colchicum and that the genus Merendera is polyphyletic. The implications of these results on the monophyly of the genera in this alliance are discussed. Two independent lineages within the paraphyletic Androcymbium are characterised by enlarged and brightly or contrastingly coloured bracts, which conceal the flowers. The tepals in these species are always cucullate. In the remaining lineages the flowers are more prominent and the tepals are mostly flat. No morphological characters can be identified that serve to diagnose the lineages in Androcymbium that are retrieved by the molecular analysis, and the only practical option is to include all species of Androcymbium within an expanded circumscription of Colchicum. The genus Colchicum in this expanded sense is defined by its short-stemmed or acaulescent habit, androecial nectaries, and 2-4-porate pollen. The necessary synonomy and new combinations are made.
10.2307/25065869|A new monotypic genus, Bangiadulcis (Bangiales, Rhodophyta) is described to accommodate the freshwater, filamentous species found in Europe, North America, and Japan, previously known as Bangia atropurpurea (Roth) C. Agardh. Bangiadulcis can be distinguished from other members of the Bangiales on the basis of cytological, reproductive, and ecological characters. Phylogenetic analyses of molecular sequence data have provided strong support for this distinct lineage.
10.2307/25065870|A new genus of the Ptychomniaceae (Ptychomniales) is described from Juan Stuven Island, south west Chile. Molecular phylogenetic analyses and morphology independently confirm the position of the taxon in the family, but features of the sporophyte (in particular a highly reduced endostome), a unique combination of gametophytic characters and a significant number of molecular autapomorphies indicate that the plant is clearly distinct from previously described genera. Molecular data demonstrate that the new genus is one of the earlier diverging lineages within the order, part of a basal grade that includes Hampeella, Ptychomniella, Tetraphidopsis, and Cladomniopsis, although its precise position remains ambiguous. The Ptychomniales occupy a key phylogenetic position as one of the earliest diverging pleurocarpous lineages with features that are intermediate between the most basal, predominantly orthotropic pleurocarps and the more derived plagiotropic taxa. The new taxon is thus of considerable phylogenetic significance and contributes to the nature conservation value of the locality.
10.2307/25065871|The use of staminal features as generic characters in Vaccinieae are reviewed and assessed using 108 OTUs belonging to 97 taxa, scored for 17 characters and then subjected to a variety of phenetic analyses. Our results suggest that such staminal features quo genetic characters are highly overrated and that any generic revision contemplated for Vaccinieae ought to encompass a much wider selection of characters.
10.2307/25065872|Distributional patterns of 81 species of three genera of Mexican gymnosperms (Ceratozamia, Dioon, Pinus) were analyzed to evaluate their contribution to the cladistic biogeography of the Mexican Transition Zone, applying Brooks Parsimony Analysis (BPA) and parsimony analysis of paralogy-free subtrees (PAPS). BPA showed three main groups of areas: clade A is comprised of the Baja California, Great Basin, and Mojavean provinces; clade B includes the Valle de Tehuacn-Cuicatln, Balsas Basin, Planicie Costera del Noreste, Planicie Costera del Noroeste, Costa del Golfo de Mxico, and Costa Pacfica provinces, located along the coasts and in the central lowlands of Mexico; and clade C includes the Appalachian, Atlantic and Gulf Coastal, Yucatn Peninsula, Caribbean, Californian, Vancouverian, Eastern Central America, Soconusco, Serranas Transstmicas, Serranas Meridionales, Sierra Madre Occidental, Altiplano, and Sierra Madre Oriental provinces, corresponding to the montane areas of the Mexican Transition Zone, Central America and some areas of the U.S.A. PAPS showed three groups of areas: clade D includes the Vancouverian, Appalachian, and Atlantic and Gulf Coastal provinces; clade E the Balsas Basin, Planicie Costera del Noreste, and Planicie Costera del Noroeste provinces; and clade F the Serranas Transstmicas, Soconusco, Serranas Meridionales, Sierra Madre Occidental, Altiplano, Sierra Madre Oriental, Baja California, Californian, Great Basin and Mojavean provinces. Comparing both analyses, three common area relationships emerge: (1) Appalachian and Atlantic and Gulf Coastal provinces, (2) Great Basin, Mojavean and Baja California provinces, and (3) Altiplano, Sierra Madre Oriental and Sierra Madre Occidental provinces. Differences between the general area cladograms can be accounted for by dispersal having a stronger influence in BPA, and the PAPS general area cladogram showing a clearer vicariant signal. The general area cladograms obtained support some area relationships not explained in previous studies, and may complement the historical distributional patterns of the biota of the Mexican Transition Zone.
10.2307/25065873|Evidence is strong that the specimens in the folio volume commonly known as the "Walter Herbarium," Natural History Museum, London, and often assumed to be the basis for the names in Thomas Walter's Flora Caroliniana (1788), are a collection gathered by John Fraser and, though seen and partially annotated by Walter, were in large part not employed by him in preparation of his book. In no case may a specimen be considered a holotype. A small number of specimens, of species from outside the area studied by Walter, may have been part of materials brought to him by Fraser, and may be interpreted as lectotypes. The great majority of specimens, though contemporary in time and often bearing Walter's handwriting, are irrelevant to typification of the Walter names of his Flora. This argument is based on identification by photograph and direct examination of many of the specimens, on determination of the handwriting of the labels as of Walter or of Fraser, and on comparison of the names of the book with the specimens of the folio.
10.2307/25065874|Joaquim de Almeida Pinto's Diccionario de botanica brasileira was published in 1873. The new scientific names in it have not appeared in the principal indices of phanerogamic scientific names. There are 12 new generic names, 317 new specific epithets, 6 new varieties, and 1 new specific combination in the book. Seven of the specific epithets have later homonyms: Elephantopus littoralis, Erythroxylum stipulosum, Heliconia sylvestris, Hyptis incana, Paspalum aquaticum, Passiflora involucrata, and Salacia corymbosa.
10.2307/25065875|We propose the adoption of the word cultigen to designate plants whose origin or selection is primarily due to intentional human activity. The word would be useful in general discourse about "wild" and "cultivated" plants and would clarify the respective scope, terminology and concepts of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN) and the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants ICNCP. Associated with this proposal is the possibility of making the distinction between these two kinds of plants explicit through their names.
10.2307/25065876|The currently used subspecific names for the annual wild and weedy relatives of domesticated sorghum either lack valid publication or have not had their priority established over competing names of equivalent priority. These problems are resolved with valid publication of the new combination Sorghum bicolor subsp. verticilliflorum and establishment of its priority and that of S. bicolor subsp. drummondii over competing synonyms.
10.2307/25065877|The illustration from J.G. Gmelin's Flora Sibirica (1749) is designated as the lectotype of Euphorbia pilosa L.
10.2307/25065878|Types for the names Barbula saxicola Lamy, Barbula subulata var. longifolia Kindb., Syntrichia alpina Brid., Tortula inermis var. submarginata Schiffn., and Tortula subulata var. compacta Schiffn., are designated here. Syntrichia alpina is considered conspecific with T. subulata Hedw., with which Tortula inermis var. submarginata and T. subulata var. compacta are also synonymized, as is Barbula subulata var. longifolia with T. schimperi M.J. Cano & al. Barbula saxicola is here considered to apply to the species currently known as Dialytrichia fragilifolia (Bizot & Cl. Roux) F. Lara; as B. saxicola has priority, this necessitates the new combination D. saxicola (Lamy) M.J. Cano.
10.2307/25065899|Solanum berthaultii and S. tarijense are two wild potato (sect. Petota) species distributed from Bolivia to northern Argentina. All authors have accepted them as good species since their publication in 1944, but they have been hypothesized to hybridize extensively with each other and with other species, despite their classification into different series and superseries by some authors. This study is a molecular counterpart (AFLPs, plastid DNA restriction site data, survey of a plastid DNA deletion) to a prior morphological study of these two species. AFLP data show weak support for separate species status for some accessions, but with many exceptions. In agreement with the morphological results we place S. tarijense into synonymy of S. berthaultii, and use herbarium specimen data for a taxonomic treatment to include a description, synonymy, and mapping of all accessions. We show similar taxonomic problems in sect. Petota and suggest that there will be a continuing trend of reduction of names in wild potatoes.
10.2307/25065900|The phylogenetic relationships of Nolana (Nolaneae, Solanaceae) were constructed using partial sequences (ca. 891 bp) of the granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI) or the waxy gene. Nolana, with 89 species, is primarily distributed in coastal Chile (49 spp.) and Peru (43 spp.), and of these, four species are recorded in Peru and Chile, and another from the Galpagos Islands, Ecuador. Our phylogenetic analysis, utilizing a sampling of 63 of the 89 species, supports the monophyly of Nolana and recovered three clades with 95%-100% bootstrap support. Nolana sessiliflora is the sister taxon to the remainder of the genus. Two large, highly supported clades are evident; one containing taxa from Chile, Peru and the Galpagos Islands, and another containing taxa from Chile and Peru. Nolana galapagensis, an endemic to the Galpagos Islands, is suggested to be sister to N. arenicola in a clade that also includes N. adansonii from southern Peru and northern Chile. These two species differ substantially in habitat preference, habit, leaf shape, and mericarp morphology. The monophyly is confirmed for a morphologically cohesive group composed of N. acuminata, N. baccata, N. elegans, N. reichei, N. parviflora, N. pterocarpa, and N. paradoxa, a clade of essentially Chilean species.
10.2307/25065901|About 13 major clades can be recognized within the genus Solanum (Solanaceae) based on chloroplast DNA sequence data. One of these is the Cyphomandra clade, which includes about 50 neotropical species. These have traditionally been placed into two or three sections: S. section Pachyphylla (formerly recognized as the genus Cyphomandra), S. section Cyphomandropsis, and S. section Glaucophyllum (monotypic and sometimes placed in S. section Cyphomandropsis). Phylogenetic relationships among 61 accessions of 35 species of the Cyphomandra clade are investigated using sequence data from the nuclear ITS region analyzed by parsimony and Bayesian inference. The Cyphomandra clade forms a monophyletic group, but the ITS data are equivocal as to the monophyly of sections Pachyphylla and Cyphomandropsis. Four well-supported groups of species can be recognized within the Cyphomandra clade; these conform in part to species groups proposed on the basis of morphology. The distribution of self-incompatible and self-compatible breeding systems is mapped onto the ITS cladogram, and patterns of evolution of enlarged anther connectives, osmophores, and volatile composition are discussed in light of hypothesized phylogenetic relationships.
10.2307/25065902|Representative taxa of Euphorbiaceae subfam. Acalyphoideae, especially of tribe Adelieae, were sampled to investigate the phylogenetic relationships of the genus Adelia using morphological and molecular (chloroplast trnL-F IGS and rbcL, and nuclear ITS DNA sequences) characters. Parsimony and Bayesian analyses were conducted. A clade containing the three genera of tribe Adelieae (Lasiocroton, Leucocroton, Adelia) was recovered. Molecular and total evidence analyses confirmed the monophyly of the genus Adelia but no synapomorphic character states supporting the Adelia clade were recovered. Adelia cinerea did not form part of the Adelia clade in the morphological analysis but was included in Adelia based on total evidence. Three main clades were retrieved in the genus, the earliest formed by A. cinerea, a second by four Mexican species distributed in deciduous forest and desert scrub, and the third by the four remaining species distributed in tropical forest in Mexico, the Caribbean, Central and South America.
10.2307/25065903|In an effort to obtain a solid and balanced approximation of global fern phylogeny to serve as a tool for addressing large-scale evolutionary questions, we assembled and analyzed the most inclusive molecular dataset for leptosporangiate ferns to date. Three plastid genes (rbcL, atpB, atpA), totaling more than 4,000 bp, were sequenced for each of 400 leptosporangiate fern species (selected using a proportional sampling approach) and five outgroups. Maximum likelihood analysis of these data yielded an especially robust phylogeny: 80% of the nodes were supported by a maximum likelihood bootstrap percentage  70. The scope of our analysis provides unprecedented insight into overall fern relationships, not only delivering additional support for the deepest leptosporangiate divergences, but also uncovering the composition of more recently emerging clades and their relationships to one another.
10.2307/25065904|The tribe Knoxieae consists of genera formerly included in (at least) four tribes of the Rubiaceae (the coffee family). Apart from Knoxia itself, which is mainly Indomalesian, the group is from Africa and Madagascar. Most genera are herbaceous or shrubby, but small trees are also present. They generally have fimbriate, colleter-tipped stipules and five-merous flowers with unequal calyx lobes. We present a molecular phylogeny of the group (based on two chloroplast markers, rps16 and trnT-F, and the nuclear ITS) and discuss the morphological support for the resulting groups and the taxonomic consequences of the phylogeny. Two hundred and sixty-one new sequences from 90 species have been obtained. Of the 19 genera of the Knoxieae, all but three (two monotypic and one with two species) are represented. The genera Calanda, Chlorochorion, Neopentanisia, and Paraknoxia are merged with Pentanisia. Pentas is shown to be not monophyletic and is split into the new genera Phyllopentas, Dolichopentas, and Rhodopentas. We also suggest the Pentas subgenera Megapentas and Chamaepentadoides be included in Chamaepentas. The genus Carphalea is also shown to be not monophyletic and for the African members of the genus (section Dirichletia) the name Dirichletia should be used. Placopoda is suggested to be merged with Dirichletia. Triainolepis is enlarged to include Paratriaina and Thyridocalyx. The tribal position of Lathraeocarpa is discussed. Twenty-nine new combinations for species and seven for infraspecific taxa are made. A key to the genera of Knoxieae is provided.
10.2307/25065905|Senecioneae is the largest tribe of Asteraceae, comprised of ca. 150 genera and 3,000 species. Approximately one-third of its species are placed in Senecio, making it one of the largest genera of flowering plants. Despite considerable efforts to classify and understand the striking morphological diversity in Senecioneae, little is known about its intergeneric relationships. This lack of phylogenetic understanding is predominantly caused by conflicting clues from morphological characters, the large size of the tribe, and the absence of a good delimitation of Senecio. Phylogenetic analyses of nrITS and plastid DNA sequence data were used to produce a hypothesis of evolutionary relationships in Senecioneae and a new, monophyletic, delimitation of Senecio. The results of separate and combined phylogenetic analyses of the two datasets were compared to previous taxonomic treatments, morphological and karyological data, and biogeographic patterns. These studies indicate that the subtribal delimitation of Senecioneae needs to be revised to reflect exclusively monophyletic subtribes. This would involve abolishing subtribes Adenostylinae, Blennospermatinae, and Tephroseridinae and recognizing subtribes Abrotanellinae, Othonninae, and Senecioninae. Moreover, Tussilagininae may need to be split into three or four subtribes: Brachyglottidinae, Chersodominae, Tussilagininae, and perhaps Doronicinae. On the intergeneric level, these phylogenies provide new insights into evolutionary relationships, resulting in a first approximation of a comprehensive phylogeny for the tribe. Most species currently assigned to Senecio form a well supported clade. Thus, a new delimitation of Senecio is proposed, which involves transferring the species of Aetheolaena, Culcitium, Hasteola, Iocenes, Lasiocephalus, and Robinsonia to Senecio and removing several Senecio groups that are only distantly related to the core of Senecio. Area optimization analyses indicate a strong African influence throughout the evolutionary history of Senecioneae, predominantly in subtribes Senecioninae and Othonninae.
10.2307/25065906|To clarify relationships within the predominantly Neotropical and exclusively fleshy-fruited Myrteae (49 genera and c. 2,500 species), we provide a phylogenetic hypothesis for evolutionary relationships between 31 of these genera by analyzing nuclear ITS and ETS ribosomal DNA, and plastid psbA-trnH and matK DNA sequences from 75 Myrteae species and 13 outgroup taxa using parsimony and Bayesian inference. Four morphological characters are epitomized on the resulting trees, and biogeographical analyses are also performed. Myrteae are monophyletic, comprising seven clades plus two isolated taxa of unclear relationships. Morphological characters exhibit homoplasy, although in combination are useful for clade diagnosis. Biogeographical analyses are inconclusive regarding the ancestral area of the tribe, but South American colonization before northern radiation via the Andes appears likely. The largest genera, Eugenia and Myrcia s.l., have western and southeastern South American origins, respectively.
10.2307/25065907|The holoparasitic family Cytinaceae (Cytinus and Bdallophyton) was previously shown to be allied with Malvales, however its closest photosynthetic ancestor was not determined. A molecular phylogenetic study was conducted using nuclear small-subunit rDNA and three chloroplast genes (the latter missing from the holoparasites but included to stabilize the overall tree topology) using Cytinaceae and exemplars from all recognized families from an expanded Malvales. Using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods, Cytinaceae were resolved with strong support as sister to the newly described Muntingiaceae. Potential morphological synapomorphies include trichome types, mature pollen released as tetrads, inferior ovaries, intrusive parietal placentation with many ovules, and fruit type. Given that all Muntingiaceae are neotropical, it is likely that the ancestor of Cytinaceae arose in the New World and migrated to continental Africa prior to the separation of Africa from South America.
10.2307/25065908|Maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) analyses of 67 nrITS sequences of various genera of the liverwort families Lophocoleaceae and Plagiochilaceae as well as Herbertaceae (outgroup) lead to a fully resolved phylogeny with the separation of Lophocoleaceae and Plagiochilaceae having a bootstrap support of 93 to 99. The monospecific genus Leptophyllopsis is placed sister to the remainder of Lophocoleaceae. Heteroscyphus is found to be monophyletic (ML) or paraphyletic (MP) with Chiloscyphus polychaetus nested in a robust subclade of Heteroscyphus. Leptoscyphus is nested in Chiloscyphus and placed sister to a clade including Chiloscyphus subgenera Chiloscyphus, Lophocolea and Notholophocolea (Chiloscyphus clade I). Chiloscyphus subg. Connati is placed sister to this Leptoscyphus/Chiloscyphus clade. Several accessions of Chiloscyphus, which have also been treated as genus Clasmatocolea are nested in Chiloscyphus clade I. The generitype of Pachyglossa is part of Chiloscyphus clade I and placed sister to Chiloscyphus subg. Notholophocolea. Pachyglossa differs only by its multistratose leaves from Chiloscyphus subg. Notholophocolea. Based on morphological similarities and the outcome of the molecular investigation, Pachyglossa is transferred to Chiloscyphus and Chiloscyphus polychaetus to Heteroscyphus. Five new combinations are introduced.
10.2307/25065909|In this study we analysed ETS sequence data of 164 accessions belonging to 31 taxa of Salicornia, a widespread, hygrohalophytic genus of succulent, annual herbs of Chenopodiaceae subfam. Salicornioideae, to investigate phylogenetic and biogeographical patterns and hypothesise about the processes that shaped them. Furthermore, our aim was to understand the reasons for the notorious taxonomic difficulties in Salicornia. Salicornia probably originated during the Miocene somewhere between the Mediterranean and Central Asia from within the perennial Sarcocornia and started to diversify during Late Pliocene/Early Pleistocene. The climatic deterioration and landscape-evolution caused by orogenetic processes probably favoured the evolution and initial diversification of this annual, strongly inbreeding lineage from the perennial Sarcocornia that shows only very limited frost tolerance. The further diversification of Salicornia was promoted by at least five intercontinental dispersal events (2 to South Africa, at least 3 to North America) and at least two independent polyploidization events resulting in rapidly expanding tetraploid lineages, both of which are able to grow in lower belts of the saltmarshes than their diploid relatives. The diploid lineages of Salicornia also show rapid and effective range expansion resulting in both widespread genotypes and multiple genotypes in a given area. Reproductive isolation through geographical isolation after dispersal, inbreeding, and comparatively young age might be responsible for the large number of only weakly differentiated lineages. The sequence data show that the taxonomic confusion in Salicornia has two major reasons: (1) in the absence of a global revision and the presence of high phenotypic plasticity, the same widespread genotypes having been given different names in different regions, and (2) striking morphological parallelism and weak morphological differentiation led to the misapplication of the same name to different genotypes in one region.
10.2307/25065910|Currently, three species of Muscari subg. Botryanthus are recognized in the Iberian Peninsula: two diploids (2n = 18), M. atlanticum and M. cazorlanum, and one morphologically variable species with three different ploidy levels, M. neglectum (2n = 36, 45, 54). We have made a comparative study of numerous Iberian populations to clarify the taxonomy and evolution of this group. To this end we carried out morphological and cytogenetic analyses, and phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacers of nuclear ribosomal DNA. Comparative and UPGMA analyses of the morphological characteristics show that the different ploidy levels of M. neglectum represent different species. We describe the pentaploid and hexaploid levels as two new species, M. olivetorum (2n = 45) and M. baeticum (2n = 54), each with an exclusive combination of morphological characters and a characteristic ecological behavior pattern. Phylogenetic study of ITS shows that the two new species are not autopolyploids from M. neglectum but allopolyploids. These findings are supported by the additivity of the three ITS variants found in M. olivetorum with the ITS of M. neglectum and M. baeticum, and also by morphology. Possible parents for both new species are proposed. Absence of homogenization between homeologous M. olivetorum nrDNA loci is explained by the absence of sexual reproduction and by nucleolar dominance, indicating that this is a recent species.
10.2307/25065911|Patterns of polyploid evolution in the taxonomically controversial Dactylorhiza incarnata/maculata groups were inferred genetically by analyzing 399 individuals from 177 localities for (1) four polymorphic plastid regions yielding aggregate haplotypes and (2) nuclear ribosomal ITS allele frequencies. Concordance between patterns observed in distributions of plastid haplotypes and ITS alleles renders ancestral polymorphism an unlikely cause of genetic variation in diploids and allopolyploids. Combining the degree of concerted evolution in ITS alleles (thought to reflect gene conversion) with inferred parentage provides support for a quadripartite classification of western European allopolyploid dactylorchids according to their respective parentage and relative dates of origin. The older allotetraploids that generally exhibit only one parental ITS allele can be divided into those derived via hybridization between the divergent complexes we now call D. incarnata s.l. and D. fuchsii (e.g., D. majalis) and those derived via hybridization between D. incarnata s.l. and D. maculata (e.g., D. elata). Similarly, the younger allotetraploids that maintain evidence of both parental ITS alleles can be divided into those derived from hybridization between D. incarnata s.l. and D. fuchsii, or perhaps in some cases a diploid species resembling D. saccifera (e.g., D. praetermissa, D. purpurella, D. traunsteineri s.l., D. baltica), and those derived from hybridization between the D. incarnata s.l. and D. maculata groups (e.g., D. occidentalis, D. sphagnicola). Older allotetraploids are inferred to have passed through glacially induced migration bottlenecks in southern Eurasia, whereas at least some younger allotetraploids now occupying northern Europe are inferred to have originated post-glacially and remain sympatric with their parents, a scenario that is largely in agreement with the morphology and ecology of these allotetraploids. ITS conversion is in most cases biased toward the maternal parent, eventually obscuring evidence of the original allopolyploidization event because plastid haplotypes also reflect the maternal contribution. Gene flow appears unexpectedly low among allotetraploids relative to diploids, whereas several mechanisms may assist the gene flow observed across ploidy levels. There is good concordance between (1) the genetically delimited species that are required to accurately represent the inferred evolutionary events and processes and (2) morphologically based species recognized in certain moderately conservative morphological classifications previously proposed for the genus. Further research will seek to improve sampling, especially in eastern Eurasia, and to develop more sensitive markers for distinguishing different lineages within (1) the remarkably genetically uniform D. incarnata group (diploids) and (2) locally differentiated populations of (in some cases unnamed) allotetraploids.
10.2307/25065912|Nuclear (AFLPs and ITSs) and chloroplast DNA markers (cpDNA) were analysed in Quercus suber L., Q. ilex L. and Q. coccifera L. in order to detect vicariant patterns in the Western Mediterranean Basin populations. Clustering methods, i.e., parsimony, minimum spanning network, UPGMA and PCO, were used to obtain robust phylogenies. The Mantel test was used to check the geographic structure of the populations. Nuclear markers' based phylogenies showed high bootstrap values at basal nodes of clusters indicative of species. Within species, Q. suber and Q. ilex showed three and two groups respectively with strong geographic structure for cytoplasmic and nuclear markers. In contrast, Q. coccifera had overlapping cpDNA lineages and nuclear markers did not show any group with strong geographic structure. Taxonomic assignation of the species was well-supported by our data. Ongoing allopatric speciation was inferred for Q. suber and Q. ilex derived from Pliocene vicariant events. Quercus coccifera showed a more homogeneous genetic pattern in the Western Mediterranean.
10.2307/25065913|Genetic diversity within and among Chilean Araucaria araucana populations was estimated using allozyme variability. A total of 537 individuals were sampled from nine populations. Twelve loci were scored in all populations and used for analyses. In general, the genetic variability of A. araucana were high as shown by mean expected heterozygosity ($H_{{\rm E}}$ = 0.151), percentage of polymorphic loci (P = 91.7%), mean number of alleles per locus (A = 1.73) and mean number of alleles per polymorphic locus ($A_{{\rm P}}$ = 2.4). Although the most of this genetic variation was within populations ($H_{{\rm S}}$ = 0.151), an important proportion of the total genetic diversity ($H_{{\rm T}}$ = 0.212) was among population ($G_{{\rm ST}}$ = 0.287). To analyze the relationships between populations we constructed a tree based on Nei's genetic distances using UPGMA methods, and calculated $F_{{\rm ST}}$ between population pairs. Our results showed complex patterns of genetic relationships among Chilean Araucaria araucana populations. Tree topology suggested the existence of three distinct groups of populations: The first group included populations from low-elevation central Andean range and Coastal range populations. The second group, included northern Andean populations. The third group of populations was composed of central high-elevation Andean populations. These patterns of population clustering are congruent with multiple glacial refugia hypothesis. In order to understand the present patterns of distribution of the genetic diversity and post-glacial colonization routes of Araucaria araucana, paleogeographical, paleoclimatic and biogeographical evidence is discussed.
10.2307/25065914|We report on the cuticular features of a number of Lauraceae species belonging to the genera Aspidostemon, Beilschmiedia, Cryptocarya and Potameia, all from Madagascar. The goal of this project was to ascertain if cuticular features could be used to determine the generic placement of a poorly known species previously placed in Cryptocarya and Aspidostemon and of several specimens which combine characters of Potameia and Beilschmiedia. We conclude that cuticular features define groups of species or genera of Lauraceae and that these characters are a promising tool in solving the generic placement of poorly known species or specimens which possess characters typical of more than one genus.
10.2307/25065915|A large-scale survey of the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research study area was conducted in which many kinds of samples were collected (e.g., plant, insect, soil). The plant samples were of a smaller size than typical herbarium accessions due to limitations in personnel, storage space, available plant materials, and time. The vouchers were identified in the field if possible. The vast majority of the rest were identified in the herbarium morphologically after the survey; less than 5% of the vouchers remained unidentified. Of these, a subset were subjected to molecular analysis using sequences of the nuclear ribosomal ITS region and to a BLAST search of sequences in GenBank to find closely related taxa. The close relatives along with the unknown specimens were subjected to maximum parsimony analysis to identify the potential phylogenetic relationships of the unknown specimens. Through this analysis nine unknown plant accessions were identified to family, tribe, genus, and species. Once this level of identification was established, some specimens were re-examined morphologically and compared with potentially related taxa in the herbarium to confirm or improve identifications. We outline an efficient method for surveying and collecting plant vouchers for a large sampling area. We also demonstrate that one can combine morphological and molecular data in the identification process to produce more complete datasets.
10.2307/25065916|We analyze distributional patterns of Neotropical flowering plants between 38 N and 55 S. Along with identification of centers of angiosperm biodiversity and endemism, we explore range size patterns and discuss implications for angiosperm evolution and conservation. Based on monographic and herbarium specimen data, a database for Neotropical angiosperms was created containing distributional and ecological data of more than 4,000 species and subspecific taxa, representing approximately 5% of all Neotropical angiosperms. Maps of species richness and endemism at 1 grid resolution were produced using a geographical information system (GIS). We found that the distribution area of most species was small (1% or less of the total Neotropical area) and that centers of narrow endemism were irregularly distributed, not coinciding with the hypothesized Pleistocene refugia and diversity hotspots. Based on identified centers of narrow endemism and forest conversion rates, we estimate that approximately 100 narrow endemic species are lost annually. Areas rich in narrow endemics but without protection status according to the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) Consortium are recognized. Our results suggest that the success of long-term conservation of angiosperm diversity relies on future protection of areas covering a larger portion of the identified centers of narrow endemism.
10.2307/25065917|Anecophytes are anthropogenic taxa which evolved under the influence of human activities in man-made habitats. Like other taxa they can be divided into indigenous (natives) and non-indigenous (aliens). Included in the anecophytes are cultigenic taxa and the hybrids between alien taxa as well as between alien and native taxa. They are native to the area where they originated. Proposed is the new term "cryptic anecophyte" for anthropogenic taxa with altered genetic structures (genotypes) not affecting the phenotypes.
10.2307/25065918|Trevesia vietnamensis J. Wen & P.K. Lc (Araliaceae) is described as an unusual new species from northwestern Vietnam. This species has 4-5-merous flowers with a 4-5-locular ovary and palmately compound leaves and would thus fit well within Brassaiopsis morphologically. Phylogenetic analysis using the nuclear ribosomal ITS and the chloroplast ndhF and trnL-F sequences, however, clearly places the new taxon in Trevesia, defined to include species with 6-16-merous flowers with 6-16-locular ovaries, and palmately lobed simple leaves. The discovery of Trevesia vietnamensis thus blurs the generic boundary between Trevesia and Brassaiopsis. The phylogenetic analysis suggests a sister-species relationship between Trevesia vietnamensis and T. lateospina from northern Thailand, a finding supported by a shared morphological character-the presence of setose hairs on the inflorescences and young stems. Trevesia vietnamensis is restricted to two localities in northwestern Vietnam. It grows in limestone areas in valleys and on shady mountain slopes at 500-700 m in primary, tropical, monsoon, broad-leaved forests.
10.2307/25065920|A review of recently published fossil Ephedraceae reveals a number of nomenclatural problems. "Liaoxia Cao & S.Q. Wu" and "Liaoxia chenii Cao & S.Q. Wu" were not validly published by Cao & S.Q. Wu in 1998 when they first described the fossils concerned. However, Liaoxia Cao & S.Q. Wu was validly published by Rydin, Wu & Friis in 2006 and Liaoxia cheniae (as "chenii") was also validly published by them, but as a new combination based on Ephedrites cheniae Guo & Wu (as "chenii"), validly published in 2000, and should be cited as Liaoxia cheniae (Guo & Wu) Cao & S.Q. Wu in Rydin & al. The epithet is corrected to cheniae because it commemorates a lady, Prof. Chen Shouliang. The continued use of Ephedrites Gpp. & Berendt is recommended because of its straightforward meaning and long history of usage, providing nomenclatural stability. Transfer to Ephedrites of names recently published in Liaoxia is deferred until a recommendation is made on the recent proposal to conserve Ephedrites with a new type.
10.2307/25065921|The recent uptake of the name Sclerophytonomyces Cif. & Tomas. sets a precedent for the potential use of 215 alternative generic names established by Ciferri and Tomaselli for lichen-forming fungi. It is generally believed that the intention of these authors was an alternative nomenclature for lichenized mycobionts, assuming that lichen names covered the entire symbiosis and were thus nomenclaturally incorrect. However, being aware of Art. 76 in the Stockholm Code ("... names given to lichens shall be considered as applying to their fungal components"; Art. 13 in subsequent Codes), the original idea of Ciferri and Tomaselli was not to replace these names, but to introduce a dual nomenclature that permitted separate naming of isolated fungal cultures, which appeared very different from the corresponding lichen mycobionts. Since Art. 76 did not allow such a dual nomenclature, the authors presented Proposal 46 to amend the Code, but at the same time published their new names separately. The names are conceptually illegitimate, but according to Art. 52.1, legitimacy is formally tied to the identify of the type specimens as governed by Art. 10.1. No type specimens were cited, yet the names are validly published since types were not required for valid publication of names prior to 1958. This has led to inconsistent interpretations of their use, and at least five generic names threaten more recently introduced generic names (Adelolecia, Allocetraria, Caleniopsis, Parmelina, Poeltinula), with about 100 species, many of which are widely distributed and well-known. About 75 of the 215 generic names were thought to be potentially available for use, because their presumed types are not types of previously published names of lichen genera. However, the species names cited as types of the 203 generic names published in the original paper lacked Latin diagnoses and so have no status under the Code, so the generic names are automatically typified under Art. 10.2 and 10.3 based on their diagnoses, which by use of the phrase "Ut in..." make direct reference to previously established generic names, and are thus formally illegitimate. Only three generic names are available for use because they are based on species with validly published names that are not the types of names of previously established genera of lichenized fungi: Coenomycogonium (based on Coenogonium interpositum), Dictyonematomyces (based on Dictyonema sericeum), and Mycocoenogonium (based on Coenogonium curvulum). However, these names are younger taxonomic synonyms of Coenogonium and Dictyonema, respectively.
10.2307/25065922|Typification of the 13 validly published, pre-1958 names of Helichrysum taxa based on Sicilian material is reassessed. Five of the types designated by Galbany-Casals & al. in their recent studies are confirmed (in some cases with additional precision), two neotypes proposed by them are superseded by lectotypes, and six lectotypes are newly designated. The correct name of the species known as H. rupestre, an illegitimate name, is H. panormitanum (or, if taken in a wide sense, H. pendulum).
25065943|The genus Veronica and its previous segregates have become one focus of the debate on whether to include paraphyletic taxa in classifications. The recent reclassification of Veronica to include the Southern Hemisphere Hebe-complex, North American Synthyris and Besseya, and the Eurasian Pseudolysimachion necessitated numerous nomenclatural changes including 24 new combinations in the latter presented here. The example of Pseudolysimachion demonstrates well the problems of paraphyletic taxa in classifications and therefore can serve as an exemplar.
25065944|The results of two recent phylogenetic studies led to the reinstatement of the tribe Sabiceeae, currently classified in the subfamily Ixoroideae s.l. (Rubiaceae) but with conflicting circumscriptions. In the present study, phylogenetic analyses based on nrITS and trnT-F sequence data of 78 taxa are performed to evaluate the different circumscriptions of Sabiceeae, the generic limits within Sabiceeae, and the biogeography of Sabicea. The polyphyly of Sabiceeae sensu Andersson is confirmed, and Pentaloncha and Temnopteryx are shown not to belong to Ixoroideae s.l. but to the subfamily Rubioideae. Our results favour a broad circumscription of Sabiceeae that includes Ecpoma, Hekistocarpa, Pseudosabicea, Sabicea, Schizostigma, Stipularia, Tamridaea and Virectaria. Sabicea sensu Wernham is not monophyletic unless Ecpoma, Pseudosabicea, Schizostigma, and Stipularia are included. We find no support for the monophyly of Stipularia, Sabicea and Pseudosabicea. Therefore, our newly circumscribed Sabiceeae contains only Hekistocarpa, Sabicea s.l. (Ecpoma, Pseudosabicea, Schizostigma, Stipularia), Tamridaea, and Virectaria. Finally, our analyses indicate several dispersal events of Sabicea species between African phytogeographical regions and continental African origins of the Malagasy, So Tomean, Asian, and Neotropical species of Sabicea via perhaps four independent dispersal events.
25065945|This is the first study of phylogenetic relationships within the pantropical group Urophylleae. Previous studies have included few representatives from this group and little is known about its phylogeny. Here we use sequence data from the rps16 intron to address the question where the four genera Temnopteryx, Pentaloncha, Pleiocarpidia, and Poecilocalyx, which have sometimes been classified in this group, belong. By using different outgroups we show that there is conflict regarding the resolution among lineages in Rubioideae, which partly affects the support for relationships within Urophylleae. Urophylleae is shown to consist of two sister groups, one consisting of Old World taxa and one smaller including the New World genera Amphidasya and Raritebe, and as sister of these two groups the African monotypic genus Temnopteryx. Pentaloncha, Pleiocarpidia, and Poecilocalyx all belong in the large Old World clade, which only comprises taxa included in the original circumscription of Urophylleae. Relationships within this group are not completely resolved, but Poecilocalyx is found to be the sister of Stelechantha, and Pleiocarpidia to be the sister of Urophyllum leucophleum. Urophyllum is paraphyletic as it seems to include Maschalocorymbus, Pleiocarpidia, Praravinia, and Pravinaria. It is not clear from the present analysis whether Pauridiantha is monophyletic or not.
25065946|The monospecific genus Plocaniophyllon occurs in mixed forests of Chiapas (Mexico) and San Marcos (Guatemala). Despite the fact that it was described in 1914, it has been poorly collected and consequently it is poorly understood. Here we describe the morphological and anatomical features that characterize Plocaniophyllon flavum Brandegee with the aim to re-evaluate its generic circumscription and tribal placement. We compare the characteristics of this genus with Deppea, with which it has been confused, but also with other genera of the tribe Hamelieae, where both have been classified. Plocaniophyllon shares with the other members of Hamelieae the presence of raphides in all organs; endodermis in the stem; palisade parenchyma formed by one layer of cells, and open spongy parenchyma in the leaf blade; stamens adnate near the corolla base; and seeds with tuberculate micro-ornamentation seed coat. Moreover, veins in Plocaniophyllon have fibers sheathing the phloem cells, with the quaternary veins forming an admedial ramified pattern; flowers are tetramerous with alternative aestivation; fruits are capsular with loculicidal and septicidal dehiscence. This combination of characters allows the distinction of Plocaniophyllon from the rest of the genera in the tribe Hamelieae. Furthermore, the fibrous vein sheathing and the admedial pattern of the quaternary veins are unique for Plocaniophyllon. The morphological and anatomical attributes of Plocaniophyllon not only justify its segregation at generic level, but also support its inclusion in the tribe Hamelieae.
25065947|Previous studies of Rennellia, Gentingia, Motleya and Prismatomeris resulted in conflicting classifications. This first phylogenetic analysis of these genera, based on morphological data, supports their separation from Morindeae s.str. as members of Prismatomerideae. Transfer of Prismatomeris subsessilis King & Gamble to Gentingia subsessilis (King & Gamble) J.T. Johansson & K.M. Wong is supported. Monotypic Motleya is nested in the Prismatomeris clade. Rennellia paniculata King & Gamble var. paniculata K.M. Wong and R. paniculata King & Gamble var. condensa K.M. Wong are monophyletic. There is no support for Rennellia morindiformis (sensu Johansson) or R. elliptica (sensu Johansson). Rennellia sp. (Fraser's Hill) is possibly conspecific with R. morindiformis (Korth.) Ridl., and R. borneensis (Baillon) Ridl. and R. elongata (King & Gamble) Ridl. with R. elliptica Korth. The relationships of Rennellia microcephala (Ridl.) K.M. Wong and R. amoena (Bremekamp) J.T. Johansson are poorly resolved. Complete resolution was not obtained probably due to a lack of good quality collections, particularly of Rennellia. The pressing priority is for fieldwork to obtain high quality specimens to allow molecular studies and comprehensive morphological investigation, to further test species limits and resolve relationships within and among these genera.
25065948|Broad-scale phylogenetic analyses of the angiosperms and of the Asteridae have failed to confidently resolve relationships among the major lineages of the campanulid Asteridae (i.e., the euasterid II of APG II, 2003). To address this problem we assembled presently available sequences for a core set of 50 taxa, representing the diversity of the four largest lineages (Apiales, Aquifoliales, Asterales, Dipsacales) as well as the smaller "unplaced" groups (e.g., Bruniaceae, Paracryphiaceae, Columelliaceae). We constructed four data matrices for phylogenetic analysis: a chloroplast coding matrix (atpB, matK, ndhF, rbcL), a chloroplast non-coding matrix (rps16 intron, trnT-F region, trnV-atpE IGS), a combined chloroplast dataset (all seven chloroplast regions), and a combined genome matrix (seven chloroplast regions plus 18S and 26S rDNA). Bayesian analyses of these datasets using mixed substitution models produced often well-resolved and supported trees. Consistent with more weakly supported results from previous studies, our analyses support the monophyly of the four major clades and the relationships among them. Most importantly, Asterales are inferred to be sister to a clade containing Apiales and Dipsacales. Paracryphiaceae is consistently placed sister to the Dipsacales. However, the exact relationships of Bruniaceae, Columelliaceae, and an Escallonia clade depended upon the dataset. Areas of poor resolution in combined analyses may be partly explained by conflict between the coding and non-coding data partitions. We discuss the implications of these results for our understanding of campanulid phylogeny and evolution, paying special attention to how our findings bear on character evolution and biogeography in Dipsacales.
25065949|To better understand the evolutionary history of the genus Artemisia (Anthemideae, Asteraceae) and its relationships to other genera of the subtribes Artemisiinae, Leucantheminae and Tanacetinae, 63 sequences of the external and 10 of the internal transcribed spacer of nuclear ribosomal DNA (ETS and ITS) were newly generated. Analyses were performed on the combined dataset using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. The combined analysis supports that all Artemisiinae genera included plus Hippolytia (subtribe Tanacetinae) and Nipponanthemum (subtribe Leucantheminae) constitute a monophyletic group. Within this group, a successive branching shows three monophyletic groups: (1) Nipponanthemum/Hippolytia/Brachanthemum; (2) the Dendranthema group; and (3) the Artemisia/Kaschgaria group. Within the latter, a new sister-group relationship is found between the monophyletic genus Kaschgaria and the Artemisia group, which comprises two main evolutionary lineages: (i) the Dracunculus clade including various Artemisia species and four Asian genera: Filifolium, Mausolea, Neopallasia and Turaniphytum; and (ii) the remaining subgenera of Artemisia plus the two North American genera: Picrothamnus and Sphaeromeria. Within this phylogenetic framework the evolution of two important characters (capitula and pollen type) in the group was inferred. Character reconstruction reveals that discoid capitula and Anthemis pollen type are the ancestral condition in the subtribe. The Artemisia/Kaschgaria lineage probably originated from an ancestor with disciform capitula, central hermaphrodite florets and Artemisia pollen type. Molecular evidence of several biogeographical migration routes of the genus Artemisia is presented.
25065950|Lithodora (Boraginaceae tribe Lithospermeae) comprises nine species of often narrowly endemic dwarf shrubs and shrubs. The genus shows a Mediterranean distribution with the centre of diversity in the western Mediterranean region. Lithodora is distinguished from its allies in Lithospermeae by a shrubby habit, the absence of both faucal scales and an annulus, and a very unusual mericarpid morphology, and it has therefore been regarded as a natural group in the past. Phylogenetic relationships of Lithodora were investigated with nuclear ribosomal ITS1 and chloroplast $trnL_{{\rm UAA}}$ intron sequences using parsimony and likelihood analyses. The results strongly indicate a polyphyly of Lithodora, which falls into two clades: The majority of species forms a monophyletic group ("Lithodora II") in a well supported clade together with a Lithospermum s.l. clade (including the New World genera Onosmodium and Macromeria) and our sample of Buglossoides species. A smaller number of species ("Lithodora I") falls into a second well supported clade including the monotypic genera Mairetis, Paramoltkia and Halacsya. A critical reevaluation of carpological characters traditionally used to delimit Lithodora corroborates the results of the molecular analysis and indicates that the cupulate areole and the mericarpid appendage found in the genus are homoplasious. The polyphyly of Lithodora is formally recognised by removing "Lithodora II" as a newly established genus, Glandora. The seven newly required combinations in the genus are provided.
25065951|Phylogenetic analyses of Melioideae, including representatives of all currently recognized tribes, were carried out using nuclear ITS ribosomal DNA sequence data. The secondary structure models employed for ITS1 and ITS2 allowed optimization of the alignment across Meliaceae genera of both subfamilies, yielding a maximum amount of information without the exclusion of some highly variable sites. This study is the first to assess the current circumscription of Melioideae and its tribes in detail, with data independent of morphology. Maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses of nuclear ITS, in contrast to analyses based on plastid rbcL, confirm monophyly for Aglaieae, Sandoriceae and Melieae, an isolated position for Vavaeeae, the position of Pterorhachis and Quivisianthe in Melioideae, and a close relationship between Turraeeae and Trichilieae. Trichilieae are morphologically and genetically the most complex tribe. Trichilieae cannot be separated from Turraeeae, Vavaeeae and Sandoriceae. Anthocarapa and "Pseudocarapa" form a clade but exhibit a high number of autapomorphies, which needs further investigation. We propose to keep Naregamia separate from Turraea, and to reconsider the present circumscription of Trichilieae.
25065952|A phylogenetic study of tribe Coreopsideae (Asteraceae) was conducted using sequences from two plastid regions matK and the trnL-trnF spacer, and nuclear ITS. Analyses of the plastid and ITS datasets result in similar topologies; thus these data partitions were combined and reanalyzed, resulting in a more highly resolved estimate of phylogeny. The plastid, ITS and total evidence trees indicate that the two largest genera of the tribe, Bidens and Coreopsis, are not monophyletic. Total evidence reveals several relationships that are not recovered by analyses of the individual data partitions, including a clade of four insular genera sister to a clade consisting of two sections of Mexican Coreopsis, and the genera Henricksonia, and Heterosperma. Furthermore, the annual, monospecific genus Dicranocarpus and Dahlia are recovered as sisters. The nuclear and plastid data partitions disagree with regard to the monophyly of Coreopsis sect. Pseudoagarista, with ITS placing the Mexican and South American members in distant clades whereas plastid sequences show them as sister groups. There is hard incongruence between the position of the enigmatic Coreocarpus congregatus in the plastid and nuclear trees. Comments are provided on possible diagnostic characters for clades in the total evidence tree.
25065953|Within the genus Scorpidium, the two species S. cossonii (Schimp.) Hedens and S. revolvens (Sw. ex Anonymo) Rubers are similar to each other in habit and superficial morphological traits, whereas S. scorpioides (Hedw.) Limpr. appears to be very different. Because finer morphological characteristics seem to tell another story, the taxonomic treatment of these species has been debated. A molecular analysis of exemplar specimens based on ITS, atpB-rbcL, rpl16, and trnL-trnF sequences reveals that S. cossonii and S. scorpioides differ from each other by 10 base substitutions/indels and from S. revolvens by 46. When relationships based on ITS, rpl16, or both markers together are analysed for numerous specimens, those of S. scorpioides appear with some S. cossonii specimens in a basal grade (rpl16) or in a clade nested within S. cossonii (ITS or both markers together). The molecular data suggest that superficial morphological data are misleading as regards to relationships within Scorpidium. There is no evidence for the recognition of the genus Limprichtia for S. cossonii and S. revolvens, or for merging these species into one. ITS data suggest recombination in S. scorpioides and rpl16 indicate exchange of chloroplast genetic material among populations of S. cossonii.
25065954|There has been a long history of interest in measuring the information conveyed by phylogenetic data. In one application, recent studies have attempted to compare the informativeness of morphological and molecular data, and of nucleotide and amino acid sequence alignments. While a variety of measures have been proposed to quantify phylogenetic information, most measures are rather unsatisfactory, failing to capture every aspect of the informativeness of a character. One measure, cladistic information content (CIC) is a natural measure of phylogenetic information. We show why CIC is preferable to other, recently introduced, measures, and, as an example, use CIC to compare the information of recent morphological and molecular datasets. This provides new empirical data relevant to the debate about the relative utility of morphology and molecules in phylogenetic inference, a subject of significant interest.
25065955|The monotypic tropical African genus Afrotrewia (with A. kamerunica; Euphorbiaceae s.str.), previously unclassified because of the lack of extant specimens, is redescribed and the species name neotypified based on newly collected material. In addition to Cameroon, its distribution is extended to Gabon. The phylogenetic position of Afrotrewia and that of the putatively related Necepsia was determined by using two chloroplast markers (trnL-F and rbcL), which were sequenced for these genera and analysed together with a previously published Euphorbiaceae s.str. dataset. In addition, the pollen of Afrotrewia was studied. The morphology of the specimens studied matches well with the original description. The phylogenetic analyses show that Afrotrewia is part of the core acalyphoid clade and not related to Necepsia, but its precise position is still ambiguous. The pollen of Afrotrewia resembles the pollen of several other acalyphoid genera; these are, however, scattered throughout the phylogenetic tree, indicating homoplasy in pollen structure. As no taxa potentially congeneric with Afrotrewia could be identified, we conclude that the generic status for this taxon is justified.
25065956|Previous studies using isozymes have established that the moss Plagiomnium curvatulum is an allopolyploid species that originated from hybridization and chromosome doubling of Plagiomnium elatum and Plagiomnium ellipticum. It has so far remained unknown which species is the donor of chloroplasts and mitochondria to P. curvatulum. Studies of organellar inheritance in bryophytes suggest that uniparental transmission was involved. Comparison of nucleotide sequence data of three chloroplast and three mitochondrial DNA markers from P. curvatulum and its parental species reveal that the chloroplast and mitochondrial sequences of P. curvatulum and P. ellipticum are identical and differ from homologous sequences of P. elatum. Seven samples from five different populations of P. curvatulum all gave the same result. Both mitochondria and chloroplasts of P. curvatulum were inherited from P. ellipticum. The nucleotide substitution rate calculated for homologous organellar nucleotide sequences is 4.57 times higher in chloroplasts than in mitochondria. Moreover, substitution rates differ considerably between chloroplast and mitochondrial homologous intron sequences when allopolyploid species and their parental haploids from different genera of bryophytes are compared.
25065957|Achillea millefolium agg. is an ecologically most diverse N Hemisphere polyploid complex. Because of ubiquitous hybridization and polyploidization, the aggregate is extremely polymorphic and notorious for its difficult taxonomy. AFLP analyses were applied to 61 populations representing most of the known taxa of A. millefolium agg. Genetic distance methods of population pairwise ${\rm F}_{{\rm ST}}$ and Neighbour Joining for tree constructions and the 2D_Euklid algorithm for scatter plots were used to evaluate the AFLP-matrix with 459, mostly polymorphic bands. The aggregate is monophyletic and sister to the subalpine relic A. latiloba-2x from NE Turkish and adjacent Georgian mountains. The seven 2x-species of A. millefolium agg. have differentiated vicariously in Europe/SW Asia and expanded into C and E Asia. Both, the NJ trees and the 2D_Euklid scatterplots demonstrate these 2x as genetically monophyletic and distinct; only A. roseoalba-2x, close to A. asplenifolia-2x, may be the product of hybrid introgression. The polyploids of the aggregate (about 20 taxa and cytotypes) exhibit various combinations of 2x AFLP bands, but in addition also 16.9% of exclusive bands, documenting new genetic variation. Whereas the ALFP trees suggest most of these polyploid taxa to be polyphyletic, the AFLP 2D_Euklid scatterplots demonstrate their phyletic coherence. This conflicting evidence apparently is due to wide-spread secondary hybrid merging between sympatric populations of different polyploid taxa, resulting in geographic instead of phyletic clustering of their populations in the AFLP trees. Available data suggest several parallel reticulating and ascending polyploid lines and their eco-geographical radiations. This has resulted in the origin of eight taxa of 4x, four or five of 6x and three of 8x in Europe and the Caucasus. One of them, A. millefolium subsp. millefolium-6x, also occurs throughout Asia, where two more 4x taxa, one additional 6x and one 8x can be recognized. Finally, from ancestors close to A. asiatica s.str.-4x, the A. borealis s.l. clade has originated in N America, where it has radiated with numerous 4x- and 6x-ecotypes into most diverse habitats. Thus, the polyploid complex A. millefolium agg., shaped by successive cycles of differentiation and hybridization + polyplodization, has expanded stepwise from Europe and SW Asia to E Asia, then to N America and finally world-wide with A. millefolium-6x as a weed.
25065958|We report agamic reproduction in Poa gymnantha, an endemic species from the high Andes of Peru, Bolivia and Chile, known only from pistillate plants. This is the first description of apomixis in Poa from South America. The species is a decaploid (2n = 10x = 70) with a basic karyotype formula of 4 m + 3 sm chromosomes. Diagnostic characters, geographic distribution and taxonomic circumscription of the species are given, along with illustrations. The paper contributes to a better understanding of floral morphology and reproduction in this agamic taxon.
25065959|Hydatellaceae was traditionally circumscribed as a family of two genera, Hydatella and Trithuria. We place Hydatella in synonymy of Trithuria. We describe three new species of Hydatellaceae from northern Australia and one new species from south-western Western Australia. Thus, we distinguish a single genus of Hydatellaceae, Trithuria, which consists of one species in New Zealand, ten species in Australia and one species in India. Two main characters were formerly used to distinguish between Hydatella and Trithuria: (1) reproductive units unisexual (homogamous) vs. bisexual (heterogamous) and (2) fruits with three prominent ribs, typically dehiscent vs. without prominent ribs, indehiscent. New evidence shows that the type of reproductive unit does not correlate with fruit morphology in Hydatellaceae. We hypothesize that two south-western Australian endemics known as Hydatella dioica and Trithuria occidentalis represent male and female individuals, respectively, of the same biological species. All four dioecious species of Hydatellaceae show similar sexual dimorphism. Male plants have reproductive units with longer and fewer involucral bracts than female ones. Anthers are much longer in dioecious species than in the morphologically closest cosexual species. The evolutionary significance of dioecy in Hydatellaceae is discussed.
25065960|Paracladopus chanthaburiensis is described from southeastern Thailand. Molecular phylogenetic evidence shows that P. chanthaburiensis and P. chiangmaiensis form the monophyletic genus Paracladopus, which is sister to Cladopus. Some of the characters of the new species are shared by P. chiangmaiensis, some others shared by Cladopus, and the remaining differ from those of the two. The ensiform leaf may be plesiomorphic in the subfamily Podostemoideae. The leaves are borne both at the sinuses of root branching and between successive branches, possibly due to leaf development within and proximal to the root meristem. The phylogeny of P. chanthaburiensis is consistent with the hypothesis that the Cladopus-Paracladopus clade, like the Hanseniella-Hydrobryum-Thawatchaia clade, originated in Thailand or the neighboring region.
25065961|The taxonomic status of Taxus in Pakistan was confused and uncertain due to opposing views about specimen identities. We used 27 morphological characters of 62 selected herbarium specimens of T. baccata, T. wallichiana and tentatively identified T. fuana to investigate the taxonomic status of Taxus in Pakistan by principal component analysis (PCA). Three discrete clusters representing the three species were identified in the PCA scatter plot. Character combinations allowed the reliable identification of specimens of T. fuana, T. baccata and T. wallichiana. Sequence data of nuclear ribosomal DNA ITS and the chloroplast trnL-F region were used to further delimitate T. baccata, T. wallichiana and T. fuana. Using maximum parsimony analysis three distinct clades were obtained representing the three species with strong bootstrap support. Based on both morphological and molecular sequence data, the Taxus species occurring in the western Himalaya including Pakistan was shown to be T. fuana and not T. wallichiana or T. baccata. The distinct species status of T. fuana, T. baccata and T. wallichiana was also well supported and found to be well correlated with their geographic distributions. The geographic ranges of the three species were updated based on the present study.
25065962|Two new species of the genus Leptophytum Adey are recognized, endemic to NW Spitsbergen respectively East Novaja Zemlya: L. jenneborgii herein described from sublittoral collections around Vasahalvya, growing on rocks and thalli of Lithothamnion glaciale, and L. arcticum known from a similar habitat at its type locality (Uddebay, East N. Zemlya). Both species exhibit a foliose and relatively large thallus, up to 10 cm in diameter, which develops several layers in an unattached-superimposed pattern, so that thickness reaches at least 1.5 cm. They differ in conceptacle morphology (convex vs rimmed multiporate roofs), including chamber and pore plate size. Their restricted distribution, on the periphery of the presumed northernmost ice limits during the latest glaciation, indicates that they are glacial survivals. Their characteristic habit sets them apart not only from Arctic congeners, but from Arctic corallines in general, and unites them with distantly related taxa from warmer waters, suggesting that they evolved before the beginning of the cooling period (mid-Tertiary) in the Arctic Ocean.
25065963|The incidence of Gracilaria bursa-pastoris, which is found mainly in Europe, in the northwest region of the Pacific Ocean was recently brought into question following the descriptions of G. parvispora and G. chouae from Hawaii and China, respectively. We examined the morphology of thalli previously identified as G. bursa-pastoris in Korea and Japan, and analyzed the plastid rbcL gene sequences of Korean and Japanese samples, and a G. parvispora sample from Hawaii. The morphological and sequence data both indicate identity between the taxon from Korea/Japan and G. parvispora from Hawaii, but significant differences exist between G. parvispora and G. bursa-pastoris from Europe. We propose that the thalli from Korea and Japan should be renamed G. parvispora. The rbcL tree grouped G. parvispora and G. damaecornis together, as a sister to the G. tikvahiae/G. isabellana/G. cuneifolia clade. This is the first recorded occurrence of G. parvispora outside Hawaii.
25065964|Clarifying the systematics of the genus Pistacia (Anacardiaceae) has been a challenging task. The use of several classical and modern classification tools resulted in disagreements. Pistacia spp. are the obligate hosts of highly specialized gall-forming aphids (Homoptera: Fordinae). It is well known that closely related species of insects may utilize closely related plants. A complete linkage cluster analysis of Pistacia species, based on presence/absence of thirteen aphid genera, is presented. Aphids recognized between evergreen and New World Pistacia species. Other Pistacia species are clustered into two groups: "Vera" (P. vera, P. atlantica, P. mutica) and "Khinjuk" (P. khinjuk, P. chinensis, P. integerrima, P. palaestina, P. terebinthus). Fordinae contribution to Pistacia taxonomy at the species and hybrid levels is discussed. The close association between insect herbivores and their hosts deserves to be used more often by plant taxonomists.
25065965|Taxonomy and relationships of Allium dentiferum, a polyploid synanthropic Mediterranean species, are assessed based on morphological, karyological and cladistic analysis. A new species, Allium galileum, closely related to A. dentiferum, is described and illustrated. Both species are large and share very long spathe valves, yellow-greenish tepals and interstaminal teeth. The new species, however, is diploid and linked to natural habitats, and is characterized by the lax and spread inflorescence, purple stamen filaments and the smaller perigon, anthers, ovary and capsule. Relationships among these two species and allied taxa of Allium sect. Codonoprasum, such as A. fuscum, A. pallens, A. paniculatum and A. longispathum, are discussed. A cladistic analysis based on morphological, karyological and phenological data of these species and taxa belonging to A. sect. Codonoprasum is presented. In the strict consensus tree the taxa are separated in distinct groups correlating with several diagnostic taxonomic characters.
25065966|In this paper we present a simple and reliable method for the extraction of nuclear DNA from grains of herbarium specimens of emmer wheat, along with a method to determine the level of DNA preservation with a set of PCR primers based on the nuclear high-molecular-weight glutenin gene. The method gave PCR products of between 80 and 1,030 bp. PCR products from each set of amplification reactions were cloned and sequenced in order to confirm their identity. We have found excellent levels of DNA preservation in grain between 49 and 107 years old, consistently amplifying products of at least 350 bp.
25065967|The chromosome number and known karyological features (karyotype description, presence of secondary constrictions, presence of accessory chromosomes, karyotype asymmetry) are reviewed for the sexually-reproducing endemic flora of the Balearic Islands (100 taxa), a continental archipelago in the Mediterranean. Chromosome numbers range from 2n = 8 (Crepis triasii) to 2n = 94 (Helictotrichon crassifolium), with 2n = 30 as the modal value. Overall, the number of inferred diploid taxa (57) predominates over polyploid ones (42). Intraspecific karyological variation accounts for about 10% of the whole endemic flora and includes within-individual polymorphisms related to (1) euploid changes involving somatic segregation or endopolyploidy, (2) the presence of supernumerary (B) chromosomes, and (3) karyological variation in species showing holocentric chromosomes. True infraspecific cytological variation involving fixed euploid changes has been verified only in a single taxon, Ranunculus paludosus subsp. barceloi. Overall, the documented patterns of infraspecific karyological variation in the endemic Balearic flora are of limited evolutionary potential since (1) fixed number of accessory chromosomes within individuals has not been detected in any endemic species so far analyzed, and (2) the two ploidal cytotypes of Ranunculus paludosus subsp. barceloi are geographically structured (Eastern vs. Western Balearics), precluding the formation of hybrid zones. The available data (singularity of chromosome numbers and ploidy levels, as well as biosystematic and molecular evidence) strongly suggest that at least nine polyploid endemic species (Agrostis barceloi, Allium antonii-bolosii, Anthyllis hyxtrix, Brassica balearica, Bupleurum barceloi, Centaurium bianoris, Coronilla montserratii, Helictotrichon crassifolium, Polycarpon colomense) could have had autochthonous origins in the Balearic archipelago from diploid or low polyploid-level ancestors. This hypothesized polyploid element accounts for at least 26.2% of the endemic polyploid flora and contrasts with the low estimates of polyploid evolution reported from oceanic archipelagos.
25065968|In this article, we present the results of a study of the herbarium collection by E.E. Lindemann kept at the Herbarium of the Botanical Department of St. Petersburg State University (LECB). Biographical data on Lindemann are given. The history of the collection, its contents and current status are discussed. The main part of Lindemann's herbarium (around 200,000 specimens) is kept at LECB. The collection was started by Eduard Lindemann's father, Emanuel Lindemann. It contains unique specimens collected by 844 collectors all over the world and sent to the Lindemanns by some of the most famous botanists of the 19th century in exchange. The most interesting specimens include those of C. Bauhin, J. Breyn and A. Clegero (XVII c.), C. Thunberg, P.S. Pallas (XVIII c.), C. Willdenow, F.A. Marschall von Bieberstein, Ch. Steven, E. Boissier, J.D. Hooker (XIX c.) and many others. At present, we have identified approximately 150 type specimens, but their actual number is much greater.
25065969|Lectotypes are designated for nineteen names applicable to species of Tortula sect. Pottia (Ehrh. ex Rchb.) Kindb. and one found to refer to Microbryum starkeanum (Hedw.) R.H. Zander. Our results show that Desmatodon gasilienii Vent., Pottia lanceolata var. lejolisii Corb., P. lanceolata var. papillosa Corb., and Tortula lindbergii Kindb. ex Broth. are all referable to the species currently known as Tortula lanceola R.H. Zander, which must, therefore, be replaced by Tortula lindbergii, published a hundred years earlier. Pottia fleischeri Warnst. is here considered to be a synonym of Tortula viridifolia (Mitt.) Blockeel & A.J.E. Smith and not of Tortula wilsonii (Hook.) R.H. Zander as proposed elsewhere. Pottia littoralis Mitt., P. notarisii Schimp., and P. propagulifera Herzog are conspecific with Tortula pallida (Lindb.) R.H. Zander. Pottia lanceolata var. leucodonta Schimp. is synonymized with Microbryum starkeanum (Hedw.) R.H. Zander. Another important change involves Tortula caucasica Lindb. ex Broth., which is considered to be conspecific with Tortula modica R.H. Zander, and must replace that name.
25065970|Documentation is provided to support the correct author citation for ten upper rank names of liverworts that have hitherto been cited incorrectly. In addition, the use of parenthetical author citations is clarified.
25065971|The name Zizania terrestris L. ( Scleria terrestris (L.) Fass.) was apparently based solely on a plate in Rheede's Hortus Malabaricus labelled "Katou Tsjolam", a Malayalam dialect name for the plant figured. As the plate shows characters of two different taxa, an epitype of Scleria terrestris is designated here to fix the current usage of the name.
25065972|An epitype for Cynoglossum montanum, a Linnaean name applied to a controversial species described from Italy, is designated in view of the poor characterization of its lectotype, an illustration published in the year 1616 based on plants from the central Apennines. The morphological analysis of the epitype and other herbarium material from the Italian peninsula allowed a better definition of diagnostic characters with respect to the closely related and broadly sympatric C. officinale, to which is connected by intermediate forms.
25066009|The African species currently residing in Peucedanum L. and associated platyspermous genera are not related to the Eurasian Peucedanum species. As the type of the genus is P. officinale L., which is part of the Eurasian group, a new generic classification is proposed for the African group. The affinities and circumscriptions of two previously enigmatic monotypic genera, Afroligusticum C. Norman and Erythroselinum Chiov., are clarified. The former is expanded, while the latter is subsumed into Lefebvrea A. Rich. along with six Peucedanum species. New combinations are formalized for 49 of the 58 species recognised, which are accommodated in six genera, as follows: Afroligusticum (13 spp.), Afrosciadium P.J.D. Winter gen. nov. (18 spp.), Cynorhiza Eckl. & Zeyh. (3 spp.), Lefebvrea (10 spp.), Nanobubon A.R. Magee gen. nov. (2 spp.), and Notobubon B.-E. van Wyk gen. nov. (12 spp.). Ten new synonyms are presented, in Cynorhiza (2), Lefebvrea (6) and Notobubon (2). Diagnostic characters include habit (woody shrubs, perennial herbs or monocarpic herbs), seasonality (evergreen or deciduous), leaf texture and arrangement, inflorescence structure, fruit morphology (size, shape and wing configuration) and fruit anatomy. The results of maximum parsimony analysis of 125 nuclear rDNA ITS sequences representing all tribes and major clades of the apioid superclade and closely related outgroups support the separation of the African group of genera from that of Eurasian Peucedanum.
25066010|ITS and rps16 intron sequences of altogether 83 species of Apiaceae subff. Saniculoideae (66 spp.), Apioideae (11 spp.), Mackinlayoideae, Azorelloideae (1 sp. each), Araliaceae subff. Hydrocotyloideae (2 spp.), Aralioideae (1 sp.) and Griseliniaceae (1 sp.) were analysed to reconstruct the phylogeny of Apiaceae subf. Saniculoideae tribe Saniculeae. Particular emphasis was placed on Eryngium, with 230-250 spp. the largest genus of Apiaceae, which was represented by 52 speices. It was found that the southern African genera Alepidea and Arctopus are (probably successive) sister to the remainder of the subfamily, followed by the Southwest Asian Actinolema and the western Eurasian Astrantia as sister genera. The cosmopolitan Sanicula and Hacquetia from Central Europe, Petagnaea from Sicily and two major (plus two smaller) clades of the cosmopolitan Eryngium form an unresolved polytomy. Eryngium consists mainly of one large clade distributed exclusively in the Old World, and a second large clade with mostly American species. The first branches of this latter clade are distributed mainly in the Iberian peninsula, implying an Old World origin of this New World clade. It also contains Australian species which apparently arrived there from South America. Although Eryngium is not resolved as monophyletic by the molecular data, it is argued that Eryngium is best interpreted as a monophyletic genus. The tribe is of southern African origin. From there, it reached western Eurasia between 49.3 and 44.6 million years ago (mya). Eryngium entered the New World between 7.4 and 6.6 mya, and Australia was reached between 2.6 and 2.2 mya.
25066011|The flora of Iran is rich in endemic species of Apiaceae, many of which have been poorly investigated and whose phylogenetic relationships are unknown. We investigate the relationships within five genus groups of Apiaceae subfamily Apioideae native to the Flora Iranica region using nuclear ribosomal DNA ITS sequences. Supplementary comparative data come from morphology and, for one of these groups, petiole anatomy and palynology. These groups of Apioideae are circumscribed initially on the basis of morphological similarities and/or the results of previous molecular systematic investigations, then redefined and confirmed as monophyletic based on the results of maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analyses of ITS sequences from a broader sampling of species. These five redefined groups and their constituent genera include the Cachrys group (Alococarpum, Azilia, Bilacunaria, Cachrys, Diplotaenia, Eriocycla, Ferulago, Prangos), Cymbocarpum group (Cymbocarpum, Ducrosia, Kalakia), Ferula group (Dorema, Ferula, Leutea), Johrenia group (Holandrea, Johrenia, Johreniopsis), and Opopanax group (Opopanax, Smyrniopsis). Azilia eryngioides is a sister group to all other members of the Cachrys group, coincident with its highly unusual morphology. The monotypic Alococarpum may be transferred into Prangos pending further study. The Cymbocarpum group is contained within tribe Tordylieae, the latter now expanded to include Cymbocarpum, and the monotypic Kalakia is submerged within Cymbocarpum. Dorema and Leutea arise from within a paraphyletic Ferula in tribe Scandiceae; nomenclatural changes are suggested, but must await supporting evidence from chloroplast DNA. Neither Johrenia nor Johreniopsis of the Johrenia group (tribe Selineae) is monophyletic, with all examined species except Johrenia golestanica arising from within a paraphyletic Holandrea. Holandrea may be transferred into Johrenia and J. golestanica may constitute a new, monotypic genus pending confirmation from further investigations. Opopanax and Smyrniopsis, traditionally treated in two tribes, are confirmed as monophyletic sister groups in the Apioid superclade. They share similar morphological attributes and are closely allied to Petroedmondia, Magydaris, and Crenosciadium.
25066012|The Hengduan Mountains of the Sino-Himalayas are rich in endemic species of Apiaceae subfamily Apioideae. To investigate relationships among these species and to ascertain their higher-level phylogenetic placements within the subfamily, we examined 106 accessions (representing 100 species from 52 genera) including the Chinese endemic genera Changium, Cyclorhiza, Notopterygium, Nothosmyrnium, and Sinolimprichtia. Sixty-three of these accessions were newly sequenced. Phylogenetic trees were inferred using maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses of nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. The phylogenetic trees were highly consistent and revealed several major clades heretofore unrecognized in the subfamily. Changium and Cyclorhiza fall within the Komarovia clade of previous investigations and Nothosmyrnium allies with tribe Pimpinelleae. Notopterygium and Sinolimprichtia along with many other taxa of Sino-Himalayan distribution comprise a well-supported East Asia clade; Vicatia and Haplosphaera arise within a paraphyletic Notopterygium. Other newly recognized, well-supported major clades include the Chamaesium clade, sister group to all other examined Apioideae except tribe Bupleureae, and the Asian Acronema clade, sister group to tribe Scandiceae. The Chamaesium clade and Bupleureae may represent the earliest diverging lineages of Apioideae in Asia. Sinodielsia allies weakly with Pterocyclus or is a sister group to the clade of tribe Apieae plus Pterocyclus; Sinodielsia is distinct from Meeboldia and Vicatia. Genera whose boundaries are poorly defined and controversial on the basis of morphology (Ligusticum, Peucedanum, Physospermopsis, Pimpinella, Pleurospermum, Sinocarum, Tongoloa, Trachyspermum) are not monophyletic in the ITS-based phylogenies. Further study of these Chinese endemics is necessary to produce a comprehensive, modern classification of Apiaceae subfamily Apioideae.
25066013|The identification and evaluation of phylogenetic incongruence remains a difficult problem in the reconstruction of evolutionary history. In this study, molecular sequence data were used to reconstruct the phylogeny of the moss genus Plagiomnium (Mniaceae). Separate analyses of gene regions from the nuclear and chloroplast compartments revealed several cases of topological incongruence, which were subsequently evaluated and compared with the behavior of documented allopolyploids in Plagiomnium. Plagiomnium, as currently circumscribed, is paraphyletic, with the epiphytic and primarily Southeast Asian genus Orthomnion nested within Plagiomnium sect. Rostrata. Previously recognized sections of Plagiomnium are also paraphyletic. Eleven out of sixteen species with multiple representatives in the analysis were found to have phylogenetic structure below the currently recognized species level. Populations of P. cuspidatum in Southeastern U.S.A., populations resembling P. tezukae in Southwest China, and three specimens from East Asia that resemble P. maximoviczii all represent distinct evolutionary lineages that may warrant formal taxonomic recognition. Incongruence between the nuclear and chloroplast genomic compartments can be partly explained by the allopolyploid origin of P. medium and P. cuspidatum. However, examples of incongruence in the placement of P. japonicum, P. undulatum, P. venustum, and Orthomnion are probably caused by increased rates of evolution and/or lack of support for branches that include these taxa. These results emphasize the importance of distinguishing between different types of incongruence on a case-by-case basis, before attempting to make general conclusions about the evolutionary processes involved in the creation of discordant gene trees.
25066014|Fagaceae include nine genera and ca. 900 species, making it one of the largest and economically important groups within Fagales. Phylogenetic relationships remain unresolved despite a long history of systematic study. We used CRABS CLAW, a single-copy nuclear gene, to generate over 2,900 base pairs of new sequence data, and combined it with previously collected molecular data to examine morphological evolution in the Fagaceae. We clarified the relationships of Chrysolepis, Lithocarpus and Quercus, and in this improved phylogenetic context we inferred morphological transformations of the cupule. Phylogenetic analyses supported an origin for Quercus from a castaneoid ancestor and a novel sister group relationship for Asian Lithocarpus and Chrysolepis; however the monophyly of both Lithocarpus and subfamily Castaneoideae was rejected. Our data suggest that North American Lithocarpus densiflorus is distantly related to Asian Lithocarpus and more closely related to Quercus, supporting the hypothesis that the uniflorous cupules of L. densiflorus and Quercus are derived from dichasium cupules via loss of lateral flowers. The sister group relationship of Asian Lithocarpus and Chrysolepis is supported by the morphological synapomorphy that each fruit is surrounded by a cupule. A new hypothesis is proposed to explain the evolution of the unusual cupules of Asian Lithocarpus and Chrysolepis. In this model, every flower represents a reduced dichasium, and we interpret the cupules of these taxa to be compound in nature, formed by multiple single-flowered cupules.
25066015|The Balkan Peninsula is known as an ice-age refugium and an area with high rates of speciation and diversification. Only a few genera have their centers of distribution in the Balkans and the endemic genus Edraianthus is one of its most prominent groups. As such, Edraianthus is an excellent model not only for studying speciation processes and genetic diversity but also for testing hypotheses regarding biogeography, identification and characterization of refugia, as well as post-glacial colonization and migration dynamics in SE Europe. The genus comprises 10 to 28 species and was traditionally divided into three sections: E. sect. Edraianthus, E. sect. Uniflori, and E. sect. Spathulati. We present here the first phylogenetic study of Edraianthus based on multiple plastid DNA sequences (trnL-F region and rbcL-atpB spacer) derived from a wide taxonomic sampling and geographic range. While the sister-group to Edraianthus could not be ascertained, the results strongly support its monophyly as currently circumscribed. The phylogentic relationships among Edraianthus and its closely related genera Halacsyella, Petkovia, Muehlbergella, and Protoedraianthus are discussed and their respective taxonomical standings are reevaluated based on molecular evidence. Our study identified several distinct monophyletic groups within Edraianthus, some of which correspond closely to previously established taxonomic treatments and some of which are first identified here. Morphologic, taxonomic, and biogeographic implications of these relationships are also discussed.
25066016|Family concepts in lichen-forming fungi are poorly understood and were traditionally based on easily observable characters. An example is the family Thelotremataceae, a species-rich group of crustose, predominantly tropical lichens with over 1,000 described species. Its distinction from Graphidaceae is largely based on ascoma shape (round vs. lirelliform). Previous studies already indicated that the distinction of these families is doubtful. However, these studies only included a few taxa of Thelotremataceae. Hence we obtained 96 new partial sequences of nuclear and mitochondrial ribosomal DNA, mostly of Thelotremataceae. We performed maximum parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of a combined dataset of 105 samples, representing 97 species. Our results indicate that Graphidaceae and Thelotremataceae cannot be separated, but form several lineages within one strongly supported monophyletic lineage. Monophyly of Graphidaceae and Thelotremataceae each in their present circumscription was rejected significantly using two independent alternative topology tests. Consequently, Thelotremataceae is reduced to synonymy with Graphidaceae. Further, numerous genera in Graphidaceae and Thelotremataceae were found to be para- or polyphyletic, including all genera currently placed in Thelotremataceae, with the sole exception of Diploschistes. In Graphidaceae, Graphis and Sarcographa are polyphyletic as currently circumscribed. However, since the topology within Graphidaceae s.l. largely lacks support and given the large number of species not yet studied, a thorough evaluation of the generic concept requires a larger dataset, including additional genes and taxa.
25066017|For the first time a phylogenetic analysis of the genus Crocus is presented. The phylogeny includes all but two of the currently 88 recognized species of the genus. The analysis is based on a total of 222 phylogenetically informative characters derived from nucleotide sequence data from three protein-coding (ndhF, accD, rpoC1) and two non-coding (trnH-psbA, rpl36-rps8) plastid regions. The phylogenetic hypothesis is in conflict with the primary classification of Mathew into subgenera and sections, most notably by placing the highly morphologically deviant C. banaticus (subgenus Crociris) not as sister group to subgenus Crocus but imbedded within it. The grouping of the taxa into series is better supported, though not entirely. Of the fifteen series recognized by Mathew, eight are confirmed as being monophyletic, monophyly of one more remains a possibility, and monophyly of a further two series is only violated by one taxon. Not unexpectedly, the two most species-rich groups, series Reticulati and series Biflori encompassing almost 1/3 of all species, are clearly non-monophyletic, but the present data do not satisfactorily solve their phylogenetic relationships.
25066018|Phylogenetic relationships based on plastid DNA sequences have recently been explored for the genus Grimmia, revealing a complex evolutionary history and many incongruities with respect to traditional views. Based on empirical observations it was postulated that episodes of allopolyploidy and various hybridization events have triggered speciation in the genus Grimmia. Comparisons of genes from different genomes could therefore help to detect putative reticulations that cannot be detected using a single genome. For this purpose phylogenetic inferences, based on the complete ITS region of nuclear ribosomal DNA, were contrasted with plastid (trnS-trnF, trnK/matK) derived ones. The ITS region proved to be highly variable in Grimmia, with various lineage-specific indels interspersed among a considerable number of conserved regions that contained important phylogenetic information. The sectional placement of most species is congruent with previous results based on plastid DNA. However, some species seemingly combine nuclear sequences of one section with chloroplast sequences of another. The species of Grimmia subg. Grimmia, with the exception of G. pulvinata, are nested within Grimmia in plastid phylogenies, but are sister to the remaining Grimmia groups and closer to Dryptodon based on nuclear DNA sequences. According to the Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test an alternative hypothesis in which Grimmia subg. Grimmia is nested within Grimmia could be rejected. Similarly, an alternative topology with G. tergestina close to G. laevigata as revealed by plastid data was clearly rejected by the SH test, supporting the observation that G. tergestina appears to have the nuclear sequence of section Orthogrimmia and the chloroplast sequence of section Guembelia. We hypothesize that both cases can be best explained by past reticulation events.
25066019|Relationships among 231 individuals of Anthyllis montana L. (Fabaceae) throughout its European and North-African distribution range were studied, evaluating 41 morphological characters in a multivariate way. The morphometric data revealed two major groups representing the western and eastern part of the species' distribution range. This pattern was basically congruent in all morphometric and previous molecular (AFLP) analyses. Further geographical structuring within the western or the eastern lineage was not obvious from the morphological data. Contradictory to molecular results, plants from the Alpes Maritimes/Liguria region clearly formed part of the western group in the morphometric analysis. The two A. montana lineages uncovered might be best described at subspecific rank, the western subsp. montana and the eastern subsp. jacquinii (A. Kern.) Hayek. Morphological discrimination between subspecies was mainly based on floral characters, and hence, subspecies montana is characterised by larger flowers, i.e., longer petals and calyx tubes. Within each of the two subspecies, regression analyses revealed correlations between vegetative traits and altitudinal as well as latitudinal origin, indicating plastic growth of A. montana modified by climatic conditions. Overall, a striking decoupling of floral and vegetative characters was noted. Therefore, the maintenance of floral differences between the two subspecies of A. montana after their Late Pleistocene separation might have persisted due to differences in pollination biology.
25066020|Wood samples from 53 species belonging to 41 genera of the Icacinaceae s.l. are investigated using light and scanning electron microscopy. The traditionally circumscribed Icacinaceae fall apart into four segregate families that are clearly nested within asterids, i.e., Icacinaceae s.str. (near or in Garryales), Cardiopteridaceae and Stemonuraceae (both Aquifoliales), and Pennantiaceae (Apiales). From a wood anatomical point of view, these families cannot easily be distinguished from each other. However, some features such as vessel distribution, perforation plate morphology, size and arrangement of vessel pits, fibre wall thickness, and the occurrence of cambial variants can be used to assign various species to one of the four families. The wood structure of the four segregate families is in general agreement with their suggested putative relatives, but the occurrence of lianas versus erect trees and shrubs is a confusing factor in getting clear phylogenetic signal from the wood structure. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses using molecular data and combined anatomical-molecular data show that Icacinaceae s.str. are not monophyletic, and their closest relatives remain unclear. The combined analyses provide moderate support for a clade including Cassinopsis, the Apodytes-group, the Emmotum-group (all Icacinaceae s.str.), and the genus Oncotheca. This clade is situated at the base of lamiids and may be closely related to Garryales. The remaining lineage of Icacinaceae s.str., the Icacina-group represented by many climbing taxa exhibiting cambial variants, is strongly supported and might be sister to the rest of lamiids.
25066022|Morphological, morphometric and molecular phylogenetic studies in the Eurasian/North American genus Krascheninnikovia suggest to synonymise all previously described taxa of this genus under the single species K. ceratoides. Krascheninnikovia ceratoides comprises two subspecies: the North American subsp. lanata, comb. nov., and the Eurasian subsp. ceratoides. The subspecies ceratoides comprises in addition to the traditional K. ceratoides also K. arborescens, K. compacta, K. eversmanniana, K. intramongolica, K. lenensis and K. pungens. Specimens sampled from a single, large population of subsp. ceratoides in western Mongolia showed extreme inter-individual variation, which encompasses almost any attribute previously considered to separate the different Eurasian species. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of the nuclear ribosomal ITS1-5.8S gene-ITS2 DNA revealed the genus Krascheninnikovia to be sister to the largely Asian genera Axyris and Ceratocarpus, all of which are characterised by the presence of stellate hairs. Nomenclaturally, subtribe Axyridinae, nom. nov., is proposed to cover this group in order to replace the illegitimate name Eurotiinae. The position of the North American genus Grayia, within or outside the Axyridinae, remains unsettled. Grayia is sister to Krascheninnikovia, Axyris and Ceratocarpus in the molecular phylogeny, but has no clearly stellate hairs. Its hairs appear intermediate between uniseriate and candelabra hairs and might be the precursor of stellate hairs. The adaptive significance of the different trichomes, life form evolution and biogeographical patterns are briefly discussed.
25066023|New specimens of Liaoxia cheniae ( Ephedrites cheniae) have been collected from the Jianshangou Bed (Liaoning, China). A reinvestigation indicates that this species belongs to Ephedra. A new combination is therefore proposed. The branching pattern of living plants and exsiccatae of Ephedra were compared with those of Alloephedra xingxuei. The results suggest that Alloephedra xingxuei be transferred to Ephedra, as E. xingxuei comb. nov.
25066024|The small poorly studied genus Verhuellia has usually been included in the genus Peperomia. However, a recent molecular study has revealed that Verhuellia is sister to all Piperaceae and neither part of, nor sister to Peperomia as expected. The genus currently includes three species, and with eight taxa described, has had a complex taxonomic history, including wrong synonymizations. Hence a thorough review of all publications mentioning Verhuellia and a detailed study of the herbarium specimens involved has been undertaken. In this paper we present a survey of the chaotic taxonomy of Verhuellia and clarify all nomenclatural obscurities. Additionally, as a consequence of the novel position of the genus, the traditional division of the family Piperaceae into two subfamilies Paperomioideae and Piperoideae is reconsidered.
25066025|Fossilized leafy shoots from South Primorye, Far East Russia, originally described as Pseudolepidodendron igrischense Ananiev 1974 by Zimina (1991), are here identified as Haskinsia colophylla Grierson & Banks 1983. The leaves in our new specimens are slightly smaller than in the North American type material. A single specimen with a sporangium casts insights on the fertile nature of this species. The nearly globose sporangium covers the central region of the lamina of an unmodified sporophyll although the exact position of insertion on the adaxial surface is unknown. The sporangium is distinguished from that in H. sagittata Edwards & Benedetto 1985 in that the latter species has ellipsoidal/obovoid sporangia. The South Primoryan strata were regarded to be of Late Devonian to Early Carboniferous age. However, since North American Haskinsia colophylla is from Early to Late Devonian, the Russian specimens may occur in older strata than previously thought.
25066026|Cladistic approaches to classification have become routine in plant systematics. Many workers now accept the following rules: (1) only synapomorphies are important for determining branching patterns (cladograms); (2) only holophyletic groups are acceptable; (3) classifications must be based directly upon these topological patterns; and (4) sister groups should have the same rank. Despite many positive aspects of cladistics, there remain several problems. Perhaps the most critical difficulty, and that which has led to the most discussion, is how to deal with character state evolution within lineages (i.e., the patristic divergence). This relates directly to the issue of recognition of paraphyletic groups. We present a new method for directly combining patristic and cladistic distances in an explicitly generated branching diagram (patrocladogram). This diagram can serve for classification using cladistic rules, because the patristic dimension has already been taken into account in the analysis. Controversial problems associated with paraphyletic groups vanish. Three examples are provided from plant groups at different levels of the taxonomic hierarchy with morphological and molecular data to suggest efficacy of the method.
25066027|Target 1 of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC) is, "a widely accessible working list of all known plant species, as a step towards a complete world Flora". This paper discusses the importance of the Target to the GSPC itself, to many sectors of science and society, and to decision makers. It then examines the progress made to date and prospects for the Target's completion. Good progress has been made in bryophytes, ferns and gymnosperms with widely accessible working lists either complete or almost so for these groups. Online working lists are available for around 50% of flowering plants. In all, Target 1 is around 53% complete. It is estimated that there are around 352,000 flowering plants and that the current gap in online coverage is around 177,000 species. The major families constituting the gap are identified, the four largest being Apocynaceae, Malvaceae, Ericaceae and Apiaceae. The large majority of families for which there is no working list available are either cosmopolitan or pantropical in distribution. However, progress to date suggests that neither broad distribution nor large numbers of species in a family are insurmountable problems in compiling working lists. The major barrier to completion of Target 1 remains the availability of taxonomists to contribute to the target. Completion of Target 1 by 2010 is possible if botanical institutions recognise the importance of the Target and collaborate, lever funding and prioritise activities appropriately.
25066028|In a recent floristic treatment, Haplocarpha thunbergii Less. was considered to be the correct name for H. scaposa Harv. The name H. thunbergii is a substitute name for Arctotis lanata Thunb. Examination of the original material in the Thunberg herbarium proved that Thunberg based the name A. lanata on three specimens each belonging to different species (those currently known as A. acaulis L., H. lanata Less. and H. parvifolia (Schltr.) Beauverd). Our identifications of these specimens proved that the names A. lanata and H. scaposa are not conspecific and H. scaposa is not a homotypic synonym of H. thunbergii. Herein a lectotype for H. scaposa is designated from the syntypes specified by Harvey. With the objective of maintaining nomenclatural stability, we lectotypify A. lanata and place it in synonymy of A. acaulis, thus preserving usage of the name H. parvifolia. An updated synonymy for A. acaulis is provided. In addition, lectotypes are designated for A. fosteri N.E. Br., A. oocephala DC., A. parvifolia Schltr., H. lyrata Harv. and H. transvaalensis Gand.
25066029|A detailed study of the species of Peucedanum occurring within the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa permitted the identity of the type of Bubon gummiferum L. ( Peucedanum gummiferum (L.) Wijnands), to be re-assessed. The type is a plate in Commelin, Horti Medici Amstelodamensis Rariorum Plantarum (1701) that closely matches, in our opinion, the species currently known as P. hypoleucum (Meisn.) Drude. Peucedanum gummiferum is therefore the correct name for this taxon.
25066030|Within the broadly understood aggregate of Linaria genistifolia from S.E. Europe and S.W. Asia, 36 names have been applied to the species recognized here as L. genistifolia (L.) Mill. and L. rubioides Vis. & Pani. In this paper, they are all presented in an annotated list with full synonymy. Nine of them apply to taxa that are currently accepted. Ten hitherto untypified names are typified here. The application of the epithets concolor, euxina, linifolia, nissana, rubioides, and sofiana that has been under dispute is resolved and a new nomenclatural arrangement proposed, including one new combination involving a change of rank-L. rubioides subsp. nissana. An identification key for the investigated taxa is presented.
25066031|In recent publications both Pulsatilla alba Rchb. and Pulsatilla alpina subsp. alba Zmelis & Paegle are treated as homotypic synonyms of P. alpina (L.) Delarbre subsp. alpina. Whereas this is correct for the former, it is not true for the latter. Pulsatilla alpina subsp. alba Zmelis & Paegle (1927) is legitimate and the correct name for Pulsatilla scherfelii (Ullep.) Skalick (P. alba auct.) at subspecific level whether or not it is regarded as distinct from P. alpina subsp. austriaca Aichele & Schwegler (1957).
25066032|The Salvador herbarium, conserved in the Botanical Institute of Barcelona, is one of the oldest in Spain, with 4,025 sheets gathered between the end of the 17th century and the middle of the 18th. We designate four lectotypes (for Acer hispanicum, Achillea chamaemelifolia, Rumex pyrenaicus and Vicia pyrenaica) and note the existence of seven isotypes of species names authored by Pourret that are conserved in BC-Salvador and in MAF-Pourret herbaria. The taxa involved were described under the pre-Linnaean system by Joan Salvador, and then Pourret used duplicates of some of them to publish new taxa in his "Chloris narbonensis".
27756699|The change of circumscription of Jarava (Stipeae) from a morphologically homogeneous section with nine species of the genus Stipa to a heterogeneous genus of ca. 60 species is criticized because of the lack of DNA data to support the change. The modification is considered inconvenient in terms of the ICBN article 14.1 on disadvantageous strict application of priority rules, due to the abundance of Stipa in South American arid regions, a fact which is reflected in the extensive use of the name Stipa by Latinamerican botanists.
27756700|Numerous linear taxon sequences can be generated from large phylogenetic trees raising questions about what criteria should be used to select an optimal sequence for collections of specimens and published taxonomic outputs including field guides. Possible criteria and ways to implement them are discussed in relation to the sequence of Angiosperm families proposed by Haston & al. (2007). We define a particular spatial arrangement in one or more dimensions of the terminal nodes of a tree as a projection of that tree; a projection method is the set of rules by which the projection is achieved. We show that the projection of the Angiosperm phylogeny to a linear sequence, proposed by Haston & al. (2007), is not ideal because it is incompletely optimized for incompletely specified criteria. Tree projection methods that promote stability and incorporation of morphological data used in herbaria and other identification guides are proposed.
27756701|Clade and monophyletic group on one hand and grade and paraphyletic group on the other hand are commonly used as pairs of interchangeable terms. I question this apparent synonymy and propose that "monophyly" and "paraphyly" should refer to a property of a set, whereas "clade" and "grade" should apply to individuals resulting from evolutionary process.
27756702|In the 1960s Taxon published articles aimed at improving botanical Seed Lists. We compared suggestions made then with the situation in 2007. Sadly the majority of problems raised in the original manuscripts were still evident today. Botanic gardens must improve if this practice is to survive.
27756703|Cheilanthoid ferns (Pteridaceae) are a diverse and ecologically important clade, unusual among ferns for their ability to colonize and diversify within xeric habitats. These extreme habitats are thought to drive the extensive evolutionary convergence, and thus morphological homoplasy, that has long thwarted a natural classification of cheilanthoid ferns. Here we present the first multigene phylogeny to focus on taxa traditionally assigned to the large genus Notholaena. New World taxa (Notholaena sensu Tryon) are only distantly related to species occurring in the Old World (Notholaena sensu Pichi Sermolli). The circumscription of Notholaena adopted in recent American floras is shown to be paraphyletic, with species usually assigned to Cheilanthes and Cheiloplecton nested within it. The position of Cheiloplecton is particularly surprisinggiven its well-developed false indusium and non-farinose blade, it is morphologically anomalous within the "notholaenoids". In addition to clarifying natural relationships, the phylogenetic hypothesis presented here helps to resolve outstanding nomenclatural issues and provides a basis for examining character evolution within this diverse, desert-adapted clade.
27756704|The Moorea Biocode seeks to compile an integrative taxonomy based on morphological, ecological, and molecular data for the entire macrobiota of the island of Moorea, French Polynesia. As a case study exploring the utility of selected molecular data for species identification within this integrative taxonomic framework, chloroplast DNA from three regions (rbcL, trnSGG, trnH-psbA) were sequenced for all species of filmy ferns (Hymenophyllaceae) known from Moorea. The relative utility of each of these regions for the purposes of phylogenetic analysis and DNA-based identification was inferred by estimating support for phylogenetic trees reconstructed from each region and by calculating intraspecific and interspecific distance values (uncorrected p) between taxa for each region. All three of these regions were found to be potentially useful for phylogenetic studies at the appropriate taxonomic level. trnH-psbA was determined to have the greatest utility as a potential marker for DNA-based identification because of its high interspecific variability and high degree of amplification success. rbcL and trnH-psbA were successfully used in combination with morphological characters to identify a previously unidentified Moorean filmy fern species, Polyphlebium borbonicum. The presented results support trnH-psbA as appropriate for completing the plant section of the Moorea Biocode, although the use of additional markers will be necessary.
27756705|Recent phylogenetic investigations of marattioid ferns (Marattiaceae) have generated a refined understanding of genus- and species-level relationships within the family. A taxonomic revision of marattioid ferns is presented here. This new taxonomy is congruent with the current understanding of the phylogeny of marattioid ferns based on both molecular and morphological data. Marattiaceae is recognized here in the broad and most commonly used sense, encompassing all extant genera. Marattia as traditionally defined is paraphyletic, and is split here into three morphologically distinct and monophyletic genera: Marattia s.str. is restricted to the Neotropics and Hawaii; Eupodium, a distinctive Neotropical genus that has not been recognized by recent authors, is resurrected; and a newly described genus Ptisana comprises the Paleotropical species. Angiopteris is circumscribed broadly to include Archangiopteris, Macroglossum, Protomarattia, and Protangiopteris. Neither Danaea nor Christensenia require changes to their circumscriptions. As Marattia s.l. is undergoing the most drastic change in this taxonomy, species-level detail is given for Marattia s.str. and the segregated genera Eupodium and Ptisana. New combinations are made in Eupodium and Ptisana. Considerable monographic work still remains to be done, and is of particular importance given the threatened status of many presently poorly understood species in this family.
27756706|In 1947 Babcock published his widely acknowledged monograph of the genus Crepis L. including a sectional classification of the species as well as extensive hypotheses about character evolution. To reinvestigate Babcock's evolutionary hypotheses and the generic delimitation of Crepis L. a phylogenetic analysis was conducted using ITS and chloroplast matK sequence data. The results revealed Crepis L. to be polyphyletic. A monophyletic clade including Central Asian and North American species of Crepis sect. Ixeridopsis is clearly isolated from Crepis s.str. and, as also supported by additional morphological evidence, needs to be transferred to the genus Askellia Weber (1984). A second clade comprising the genera Lapsana L. and Rhagadiolus Juss. as well as a statistically strongly supported clade of several Crepis species is sister to a third clade: the monophyletic Crepis s.str. Within Crepis s.str. the molecular data does not support Babcock's sectional delimitation which is mainly based on his hypotheses about karyotype evolution. Hence, morphological and karyological characters are re-assessed with regard to the molecular phylogeny.
27756707|The genus Myopordon, with six perennial species from Iran, Lebanon, Syria and Turkey, had until recently been placed in the Carduinae subtribe. Oligochaeta, composed of four annual species from the Caucasus, India, the Near East and Pakistan, was considered related to the genus Rhaponticum in the Centaureinae subtribe. The two genera have apparently not much in common; however, evidence that both are closely related within the Rhaponticum group was provided by recent molecular phylogenetic reconstructions. New and previously published cytogenetical (fluorescent in situ hybridization of rDNA genes, fluorochrome banding of AT- and GC-rich regions, silver nitrate staining of active ribosomal genes, genome size assessment), karyological, molecular phylogenetic and palynological data are evaluated in the light of the recent evidence concerning the relationships of Myopordon and Oligochaeta. Myopordon presents a constant chromosome number and a homogeneous pattern in physical mapping of rDNA genes, contrasting with a strong variability in chromosome banding, genome size and pollen-type. Such tendencies could be related to the environmental pressures in the high mountains where species of Myopordon occur. This also accords well with the phylogeny and the geographic distribution of the genus. Phylogenetic reconstructions resolve Oligochaeta as being nested in the clade of Myopordon species. The exceptional cytogenetical, karyological, as well as palynological characters of Oligochaeta are apparently derived from a Myopordon-like ancestor.
27756708|Phylogenetic analyses of separate and combined plastid trnL-trnF and nuclear ITS DNA sequences were used to investigate the delimitation of Cineraria with respect to five species previously included in Cineraria, its infrageneric structure, and to contribute to knowledge regarding its relationships in the tribe Senecioneae (Asteraceae). The molecular phylogenetic study (corroborated by morphological evidence) has resulted in a revised generic concept/circumscription for Cineraria with the removal of anomalous species from the genus and the recognition of two new genera: Bolandia and Oresbia. Bolandia comprises two South African species (B. argillacea, B. pedunculosa) previously included in Cineraria. The monotypic Oresbia heterocarpa (syn.: C. tomentosa) has unique morphological features and exhibits strongly incongruent placement with Kleinia galpinii versus Dendrosenecio kilimanjari in the trnL-trnF and ITS datasets, respectively. The other species previously placed in Cineraria are reinstated as Senecio cordifolius (syn.: C. mitellifolia) or reassigned as S. hederiformis (syn.: C. hederifolia) because of their close relationships to species currently placed in Senecio s.1. in a clade that also includes Pericallis. Cineraria now has a coherent morphological concept as plants with palmately veined leaves, radiate, calyculate capitula, obtuse/penicillate style apices and obovate, compressed cypselae with two distinct margins or wings and a substantial carpopodium. The species-level comparisons within Cineraria show surprisingly limited amounts of DNA variation that nonetheless have striking points of incongruence between the trnL-trnF and ITS datasets. Cineraria evidently experienced a rapid biogeographic and morphological diversification periodically punctuated by bouts of reticulate evolution. Investigations into relationships within the Senecioneae concur with previous reports that Cineraria is related to Pericallis and Dendrosenecio, and our increased taxonomic sampling identifies Bolandia as a putative sister-genus to Cineraria.
27756709|There is much debate about the phylogenetic relationships within the temperate bamboo clade inferred from morphological and anatomical data. To investigate these relationships, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and partial granule-bound starch synthase I gene (GBSSI) sequences were obtained from 47 species representing the two widely subtribes and 26 genera of the temperate bamboo clade. All analyses of the DNA data using maximum parsimony and Bayesian reference confirm that the temperate bamboos form a robust monophyly with 100% bootstrap support. Our results suggest that the Racemobambosinae is not a member of the temperate clade. The two major subtribes, Arundinariinae and Shibataeinae, are each rejected as monophyletic. This is somewhat unexpected as the definition of the subtribes is based on the inflorescence types that have been widely accepted. Our results also suggest that, in the temperate clade, Arundinaria s.l., Pleioblastus, Chimonobambusa, Sinobambusa, and even the "well-defined" Phyllostachys, are not monophyletic. Therefore, most genera, as currently delimited, within the temperate clade are highly heterogeneous. Using GBSSI, ITS, and GBSSI-ITS combined data it is revealed that Phyllostachys and Shibataea are closely related and that the combination of Menstruocalamus and Qiongzhuea and even some species of Sinobambusia into Chimonobambusa is warranted. Brachystachyum is not supported as being derived within Semiarundinaria. This implies that many morphological characters used for subtribal divisions and generic delimitation in the current systems of bamboo classification are homoplastic and that their evolutionary meaning should be reevaluated.
27756710|Based on nucleotide sequences from three chloroplast DNA regions (rps16, rpl16, trnT-trnL), we infer detailed phylogenetic relationships within the subfamily Thunbergioideae (Acanthaceae) and among major lineages of the family as a whole. Taxa were sampled to cover the geographic distribution of Thunbergioideae and to include all subgenera of the largest genus Thunbergia. All other major lineages of Acanthaceae were sampled to test monophyly and intrafamilial position of Thunbergioideae. Both parsimony and Bayesian analyses support Thunbergioideae as monophyletic. The mangrove genus Avicennia is consistently placed as sister to Thunbergioideae although with only moderate support. Thunbergia and Mendoncia are both monophyletic in all analyses, and Mendoncia is placed as sister to Thunbergia plus Pseudocalyx. Relationships within the two largest genera Mendoncia and Thunbergia are highly resolved and most branches are strongly supported. Our results suggest that the existing morphology-based classification of Thunbergia partially holds, but needs revision. Based on the phylogenetic relationships we found it likely that a twining habit is ancestral for the genus Thunbergia. The thecal awns, characteristic for many species in the genus, have probably evolved from unicellular bristles. Longitudinal dehiscence over the whole length of the thecae, which is present in many Thunbergia species, most likely evolved from short slits or pores as present in Pseudocalyx and Mendoncia.
27756711|Phylogenetic analyses were conducted with 51 parsimony-informative morphological characters and previously generated DNA sequence data from five genic regions (ITS, trnL-trnF, rpl16, matK, trnC-trnD) to revise the classification of Symplocaceae in accordance with ranked monophyly. Observed conflict between the morphological and molecular estimates is interpreted as a consequence of convergent features of the androecium among two clades of the family, possibly influenced by the advent of hummingbird pollination in the largest New World lineage. All nine taxa above the species level in the revised classification (two genera, and within Symplocos two subgenera, three sections, and two series) are based on clades with 90% bootstrap support values and Bayesian posterior probabilities of 1.00 in molecular analyses. Symplocos section Cordyloblaste (two species) is elevated to the genus level on the basis of both its position as sister to all other Symplocos species and morphological differences that have been used to delineate genera in other Ericalean families. Optimization of the morphological characters onto one of the trees from the combined morphological and molecular analysis suggests that all nine recognized taxa correspond to clades that have at least two morphological synapomorphies, although for two of these clades support is provided by only ambiguous characters. All 318 species of Symplocos, as currently recognized in the literature, are assigned to subdivisions. The assignment of 90 of these is based on molecular and morphological data, and that of the rest (as yet unsampled for DNA sequence characters) on morphological attributes alone. The ranks of two taxa are changed (to Symplocos subgenus Palura and Symplocos series Urbaniocharis), several lectotypes are designated, and a key to genera and subdivisions of Symplocos, descriptions, and complete synonymy are provided.
27756712|Bomarea with 100110 species represents the most diverse genus of Alstroemeriaceae. The genus is distributed from Chile to Mexico and comprises twining, prostrate or erect herbs with tuberous storage roots and pendant, showy flowers. Phylogenetic relationships and patterns of evolution within Bomarea have not yet been explored. Thus, neither the currently accepted classification nor patterns of morphological evolution have been evaluated. To resolve relationships within Bomarea, we sequenced three cpDNA regions (psbA-trnH, rpoB-trnC, matK) and the nrDNA ITS spacer regions (ITS 1 AND ITS 2). MP and ML analyses of the combined data recover three major lineages in the genus and the composition of these clades is inconsistent with previous classifications based of morphology and biogeography. Patterns of evolution for three morphological characters were investigated by mapping them onto the phylogeny. The analyses indicate that the ancestor of Bomarea had compound umbels, a twining habit, and foliar indument. The phylogenetic analyses were unable to obtain high support, which suggests a relatively recent and rapid radiation of this genus.
27756713|Broad phylogenetic analyses of Crassulaceae have retrieved a large clade comprising as much as one-third of the species diversity present in the family as a whole. This so-called Acre clade (Sedoideae) includes familiar genera such as Echeveria, Graptopetalum, and Thompsonella, and while it is consistently recovered in studies at the family level, relationships within the clade as well as the monophyly of many of the constituant genera have yet to be established. Results of a phylogenetic study of a genus within the Acre clade, Thompsonella, are here reported. Morphological evidence was gathered and molecular (nuclear ETS and ITS) DNA sequences were generated for forty-seven taxa from the Acre clade, including all recognized members of Thompsonella. Parsimony analysis of the combined data retrieved Thompsonella as a monophyletic group and retrieved species in Graptopetalum, Thompsonella, Echeveria, Pachyphytum and Sedum sect. Pachysedum in a clade; this group was previously identified as the "Echeveria group". Results indicate that only a few genera in the Acre clade are monophyletic and that to establish their generic limits further sampling mainly in the large Echeveria and Sedum genera is needed. Results from morphological and molecular analyses disagree in the position of T. mixtecana. However, an additional restricted analysis performed solely with cpDNA (rps16) placed this species within Thompsonella, suggesting a hybrid origin.
27756714|The American species of Hordeum form a monophyletic group of closely related species, in which a rapid radiation took place in South America during the last two million years. Species relationships within this group could up to now not be clarified because of the small sequence differences among the species or incomplete sorting of ancient alleles. To overcome these problems we analyzed 65 samples covering all 13 diploid New World species with amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis (AFLP). Six primer combinations yielded 858 fragments, 765 of which were potentially parsimony informative. Two samples of diploid Asian Hordeum species were included as outgroup taxa. AFLP analysis was able to resolve species relationships, showing Californian H. brachyantherum as sister to four major phylogenetic groups from South America. These are a central Argentine and northern Andean group (H. cordobense, H. muticum), a mainly central to northern Argentine group including two North American species (H. erectifolium, H. euclaston, H. intercedens, H. pusillum, H. stenostachys), a group occurring mainly in southern Patagonia (H. comosum, H. patagonicum, H. pubiflorum), and a group of two species, whose close relationship has not been inferred before (H. chilense, H. flexuosum). Within these groups, sister species can be resolved with high bootstrap support, while statistical support for the branches defining the relationships among these groups is relatively low. The AFLP results support the monophyly of the three annual New World species, as well as earlier findings regarding intercontinental long-distance dispersals from South to North America.
27756715|Polyploidy, probably the single most important mode of sympatric speciation in plants, tends to result in complicated evolutionary patterns. The Cardamine digitata aggregate is a species complex where polyploidy has resulted in taxonomic and nomenclatural controversies. Two basic chromosome numbers are found (x = 7 and x = 8), and all plants studied so far are tetra- to dodecaploids. We used six microsatellite loci originally developed for the Arabidopsis genome to identify evolutionary and taxonomic units within the C. digitata aggregate, obtaining 102 polymorphic markers. Using different analysis methods (PCO, CVA, STRUCTURE, parsimony), we recognised four approximately equidistant units corresponding in morphology with the four described species: C. blaisdellii, C. digitata, C. microphylla, and C. purpurea. All taxa include at least two ploidal levels; thus recurrent taxonomic autopolyploidy is indicated.
27756716|The biosystematics of Jacobaea maritima (L.) Pelser & Meijden and four closely related taxa in the Central Mediterranean area has been studied. Nine representative populations of five taxa (J. maritima subsp. maritima, subsp. bicolor, subsp. gibbosa, J. ambigua subsp. ambigua and subsp. nebrodensis) were analysed. Molecular analysis confirms close relationships among taxa (trnLEU and ITS II sequences are identical); ITS I and ISSR analysis, on the other hand, shows some variability. Multivariate PCoA, based on 22 morphological variables, shows a gradient connecting all populations; a rather clear grouping of taxa is obtained, however, when the population from Levanzo is excluded. Finally, a new subspecies, J. maritima subsp. sicula, is proposed.
27756717|The taxonomy of the Leptogium lichenoides complex is revised here based on a morphological, ecological and molecular phylogenetic study. A phylogenetic analysis of phenotypic characters was compared to a phylogeny based on nrITS and -tubulin data. Using these phylogenies, we concluded that what was commonly recognized as Leptogium lichenoides s.l. encompasses three distinct species. Leptogium lichenoides var. pulvinatum is now recognized as a separate species L. pulvinatum comb. nov. Leptogium aragonii sp. nov., a non-isidiate species with large thalli, is the second species part of this complex, and L. lichenoides s.str., as redefined here, is the only species of this group with isidia. We also found that Leptogium lichenoides s.l. is polyphyletic. Leptogium pulvinatum and L. lichenoides s.str. are more closely related to L. gelatinosum than to L. aragonii. The taxonomic status of L. quercicola is reduced to a variety of L. pulvinatum. Identification key, descriptions and distribution maps are presented for Leptogium aragonii, L. gelatinosum, L. intermedium, L. lichenoides s.str., L. pulvinatum, and L. pulvinatum var. quercicola.
27756718|The previous taxonomic treatments of Paeonia arietina (= P. mascula subsp. arietina) and studies on relationships with its allies are reviewed. As a result of examination of a large number of herbarium specimens, extensive field observations, population sampling in the Mediterranean region, Turkey and the Balkan, and subsequent analysis, the P. arietinaP. parnassica group is found to be distinct from P. mascula in having tuberous roots, hirsute stems, petioles and sepals, and leaves that are mostly densely villose beneath. Our morphological and molecular data indicate that the P. arietinaP. parnassica group is most closely related to the P. officinalis group. These two groups are clearly separated from each other by differences in the indumentum of the sepals and stems, and in the shape, number and indumentum of the leaflets/segments. Paeonia parnassica is distinguished from P. arietina mainly by the dark purple petals (vs. pink or red) and purple anthers (vs. yellow). Paeonia officinalis subsp. banatica can not be clearly distinguished from P. officinalis subsp. officinalis. As a result, P. arietina and P. parnassica are recognized at specific rank, whilst P. officinalis subsp. banatica is retained as a subspecies.
27756719|Since the introduction of Arabidopsis thaliana, the Thale Cress, to a broader scientific community in 1965, nearly 40 years passed until the phylogenetic position of this species was resolved and its closest relatives were characterized. More and more molecular data is available for Arabidopsis thaliana and it has become the most important model system among dicotyledonous plants. However, Arabidopsis thaliana provides only a limited set of traits and characters. We are now in the position that scientists move into the more diverse relatives of Arabidopsis, transferring knowledge from the model plant to these species. Hereby past taxonomy and phylogenetic concepts may lead to misunderstanding and confusion. Consequently there is much need to provide a comprehensive overview on current knowledge of systematics, evolution and diversity of Arabidopsis and its relatives, despite the several actual reviews focusing on various aspects of its taxonomy, ecology, and importance as model system considering also the closest wild relatives. Herein, we aim to critically discuss the most recent taxonomic and systematic conclusions in the light of a worldwide screening of genetic diversity within the genus Arabidopsis. We also define gaps of knowledge to focus and stimulate future research activities.
27756720|Insufficient reserves of genomic DNA can hamper molecular phylogenetic analysis. High-throughput genetic techniques that require relatively large amounts of DNA, the difficulty in obtaining samples of taxa from remote regions, and re-sampling of limited archival DNA by repeated phylogenetic surveys can often limit the DNA available for study. To provide a possible solution to this problem, we applied Multiple Displacement Amplification (MDA) to eight archival genomic DNA extracts. The performance of MDA-treated DNA versus untreated genomic extract was evaluated by PCR amplification of three common phylogenetic markers (psbB, nad7, ITS) across a dilution series. Generally, amplification of all three genetic markers from the MDA-treated DNA dilutions was greater than from equivalent dilutions of untreated genomic template. These results indicate that genes from all three plant genomes were amplified and that copies of the target genes psbB, nad7, and ITS were substantially increased during the MDA procedure. Sequencing of the psbB, nad7, and ITS PCR products from both the MDA-treated DNA and the untreated template was used to assess the fidelity of the MDA procedure. Sequences from the MDA-treated DNA and the untreated genomic template differed by 1.2  104%, which is within the margin of Taq error. These findings emphasize the significance of Multiple Displacement Amplification for optimization of weak PCR, maintenance of depleted genetic stocks, increasing density of taxon sampling, and improving consistency between different phylogenetic analyses.
27756721|The Identity of Curcuma zedoaria (Christm.) Roscoe and its nomenclatural history are explained. Roscoe wrongly interpreted the basionym of this name and applied his combination to different taxon, which is not even involved in Christmann's protologue. The first lectotypification applied the name to the species upon which Rheede's description of Kua was based. Study of living material reveals that the name C. zedoaria (Christm.) Roscoe is currently applied to several superficially similar taxa in different parts of India and SE Asia and there are no grounds to propose conservation of the name with a different type. To avoid more confusion, the identity of the plant representing C. zedoaria in the sense lectotypified by Burtt (1977) is explained here and a colour plate depicting its morphology is provided. The plant described and depicted by Roxburgh as Curucuma zerumbet Roxb., a name usually cited among synonyms of C. zedoaria (Christm.) Roscoe, is found to represent the taxon that Roscae had in mind while publishing his combination C. zedoaria (Christm.) Roscoe. Curcuma zerumbet Roxb. is illegitimate, however, and as there is no other name available or this taxon it is described here as Curcuma picta. The nomenclatural history of Amomum zerumbet J. Knig nom. illeg. and Erndlia subpersonata Giseke, names which are involved in the illegitimacy of C. zerumbet Roxb., is explained.
27756722|A proposal was recently made (Redhead & al. in Taxon 55. 2006) to conserve the name Boletus applanatus Pers., and a neotype was selected for it. However, two externally almost indistinguishable specied occur in Europe: Ganoderma applanatum (Pers.) Pat. as commonly understood, and G. adspersum (Schulzer) Donk. In this paper we examine the selected neotype of Boletus applanatus and determine that it conforms to the current European concept of G. applanatum rather than to the superficially similar G. adspersum.
27756723|Recent work on Nymphaea ampla (Salisb.) DC, s.1. in tropical America suggests that two species should be distinguished within this broadly circumscribed taxon, which formerly has mostly been treated to include all of the native tropical diurnally flowering water-liliees of Central and South America and the Antilles. The two species are distinguished by their leaf margin, venation pattern, and coloration; by the number of flower parts; and by seed morphology. To determine proper nomenclature for the two recognized species, the typification of all relevant names is investigated. The typification of several names is reported, including the two names proposed for acceptance: N. ampla for a species of Mexico, Mesoamerica, and the Greater Antilles and N. pulchella DC. for a species from southern and central Mexico, southern Mesoamerica, South America, and the Greater and Lesser Antilles.
27756724|Typification of names of lichen-forming fungi referring to taxa currently placed in the genus Caloplaca was undertaken by examination of material from the Acharius herbaria (BM-ACH, H-ACH, UPS-ACH). Lecto-types are selected for Lecanora inalpina, Lecanora teicholyta, Lecidea aurantiaca var. rubescens, Lecidea caesiorufa, Lecidea turneriana, Lichen erythrellus and Parmelia microthelia and the holotype identified for Lecidea viridirufa. Lecidea caesiorufa var. festiva and Lichen craspedius are illegitimate names and both are automatically typified by the type of Lichen arenaritus.
27756725|Morphological studies of Acosmium Schott indicate that the majority of species currently included in the genus should be transferred to Leptolobium Vogel. This paper presents a nomenclatural treatment reflecting reinstatement of the name Leptolobium. Five new combinations are made, five new synonyms are recognized, lectotypes of five species names are designated, and two names, hitherto assigned to Acosmium, are excluded from both that genus and Leptolobium.
27756726|The nomenclatural problems involved with subgeneric names under Parodia are elucidated, and the nomenclature of all existing names is evaluated in detail. Subgeneric names under Notocactus are similarly covered in a second part. A thrid part consists of a list of published subgeneric names for the group arranged alphabetically by the epithet of the name of the species indicating the type.
27756765|The Nymphaeales (water lilies) clade has diverged as the second branch in the tree of angiosperms and is composed of the three families Cabombaceae, Nymphaeaceae and Hydatellaceae. Extant species diversity is constituted by 82 species, about half of which belong to the nearly globally distributed genus Nymphaea. DNA sequence datasets of multiple non-coding and rapidly evolving regions from all three genomic compartments (ca. 8 kb of sequence per taxon) for a dense sampling of Nymphaeales, Austrobaileyales and Amborella were examined. In an attempt to review the literature on water lilies of the past decades a matrix comprising 62 morphological characters was generated. The crown group of extant Nymphaeales is supported by a series of synapomorphies, several of which have evolved in line with the acquisition of herbaceous habits and adaptations to an aquatic lifestyle such as the loss of cambium and sclerenchyma. Further innovations evolved subsequently within the diversification of the water lily crown group such as hydropotes, or an aril as floating device for the seeds in core Nymphaeaceae that have evolved fruits ripening under water. Both Hydatellaceae and Cabombaceae exhibit many derived features that in part may be explained as adaptations to anemophily. The Nymphaeaceae are supported as monophyletic by most character partitions, including morphology, as are Nuphar and Barclaya as successive sisters to the core Nymphaeacae (Nymphaea, Ondinea, Euryale, Victoria). Parsimony analysis of the morphological dataset alone yielded a well resolved and statistically supported tree. Ondinea appears as a close relative of the Australian subg. Anecphya clade within Nymphaea by all genomic compartments and morphology. Earlier hypotheses of Nymphaea being paraphyletic to the Euryale-Victoria clade are inferred in nuclear trees, albeit with low support. Different morphological characters equivocally support a position of the Euryale-Victoria clade as sister to the subg. Hydrocallis-Lotus clade within Nymphaea or as sister to all species of Nymphaea. The diversification of the water lily clade is further characterized by a trend towards increased complexity in floral architecture.
27756766|Vegetative and leaf architectural characters are used to assess the phylogenetic relationships of species of Cabombaceae and Nymphaeaceae. Twenty-eight species representing all eight genera and the five subgenera of Nymphaea are analyzed. These morphological analyses give robust support to other molecular and morphological analyses of the relationships of the two families. There is strong support for the two families to be monophyletic, and that Euryale and Victoria are closely related. Strict consensus analyses show that within the Nymphaeaceae, Nuphar is the first sister clade, followed by Barclaya and finally by a polytomy of Ondinea, Euryale-Victoria and Nymphaea. The relationships of Ondinea are uncertain, in part due to missing characters. Finally, the genera of each family are monophyletic. Each genus has a suite of distinctive vegetative characteristics that are used to make an identification key of the genera. Although the value of vegetative and leaf architectural characters is shown, inclusion of atypical leaves, for example some types of submerged leaves, results in less resolved or robust trees.
27756767|Perianth differentiation into distinct morphological whorls (sepals and petals) can be difficult to assess, particularly in early-divergent angiosperms. The perianth of members of Nymphaeales (Cabomba, Brasenia, Barclaya, Euryale, Nuphar, Nymphaea, Victoria, Ondinea) has been described as differentiated into sepals and petals, undifferentiated or presenting examples of both states. In this paper, we review perianth structure in Nymphaeales using morphology and ontogeny in order to determine whether their perianths are dimorphic. The results indicate that although there are differences between the outer and inner perianth series, the organs display few "typical" sepal-petal characteristics. Our observations of the perianth of Nuphar and Nymphaea, and reports on Euryale, show that sepaloid (green) and petaloid (yellow) areas can both occur on individual perianth organs, and that sepaloid areas occur mostly in the regions of the perianth organ that were exposed when the flower was in bud. SEM study revealed further morphological differences between the sepaloid and petaloid areas of Nuphar and Nymphaea and also between the exposed and covered regions of the perianth of Cabomba, Brasenia and Barclaya. We discuss the implications of these results with respect to current concepts of perianth differentiation.
27756768|Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for the basal angiosperms Amborella trichopoda (Amborellaceae) and the water lily Nuphar advena (Nymphaeaceae) have proven valuable in identification of gene pairs to study the timing of duplication events relative to the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all extant angiosperms. Here we discuss how ESTs for these taxa are also useful for deducing gene families that were present in the MRCA of all flowering plants. For example, 4,572 gene clusters identified in an analysis of the rice and Arabidopsis proteomes contained putative orthologs of Amborella or Nuphar. Homologs of many developmentally important genes were identified from Amborella or Nuphar in these gene clusters. This number of ancestral genes is expected to increase as the number of Amborella and water lily ESTs increases. Genes found unduplicated in the rice and Arabidopsis genomes may be especially useful for phylogenetic analyses including diverse angiosperm lineages. We identify 595 of these single copy genes with putative orthologs in Amborella or Nuphar. Phylogenetic analysis of one of these nuclear single-copy genes encoding the enzyme carboxymethylenebutenolidase yields a topology that places Amborella and Nuphar as the sisters to all other extant lineages of angiosperms and is generally consistent with current angiosperm phylogenies based mainly on chloroplast, mitochondrial, and nuclear ribosomal sequences.
27756769|With the present study we attempt to elucidate the history of the order Nymphaealeswater-lilies and relativesin time and space. On the basis of a dense taxon sampling that covers all genera of Cabombaceae and Nymphaeaceae and all subgenera of the genus Nymphaea, and on the basis of well-supported phylogenetic hypotheses, we estimate divergence times in Nymphaeales. Distribution data for all species are used to reconstruct ancestral ranges and to identify possible dispersal events in the biogeographic history of Nymphaeales. Considering the fossil record for the clade as well as geologic history, a plausible historical scenario can be drawn. The assessment of extant biogeography shows that there are several centres of species diversity for Nymphaeales, i.e., northern South America, Central America, the Zambezian region of Africa and northern Australia. However, the diversification of the Nymphaeales started in the Northern Hemisphere when the northern landmasses were covered by tropical vegetation, except for the very high latitudes. The estimation of divergence times depicted two distinct radiation events, a rapid first differentiation into three major lineages during the Paleocene (Cabombaceae, Nuphar, remaining Nymphaeaceae) and the radiation of core Nymphaeaceae (Victoria, Euryale, Nymphaea incl. Ondinea) from the Late Oligocene to Middle Miocene. The second radiation probably started in the Northern Hemisphere. We hypothesize that subsequent spatial separation and southward relocation of the descendants led to the disjunct distribution of extant sister lineages in core Nymphaeaceae, e.g., Euryale-Victoria or Nymphaea subgg. Hydrocallis and Lotos.
27756770|A fossil herbaceous angiosperm, Pluricarpellatia peltata gen. et sp. nov., is described from the Lower Creatceous Crato Formation of northeastern Brazil. The description is based on several nearly complete specimens with roots, cordate, excentrically peltate to centrally peltate leaves, and flowering structures with in situ seeds. The seeds are smooth to verrucate and have the micropyle and hilum close together and have laminar placetation. Pluricarpellatia shares several characters with extant Nymphaeales, such a rhizomatous growth from simple, petiolate, peltate leaves, and laminar placenation. Similarities to Cabombaceae include an apocarpous gynoecium. However, the carpel morphology clearly differs from extant Cabombaceae so that Pluricarpellatia is considered to represent an exinct member of Nymphaeales, most likely branching off early in this lineage, and may thus be the most basal member of this clade described so far. In addition to Pluricarpellatia an unnamed nymphaelean plant (Taxon A), possibly belonging to the Nymphaeceae, is described. During the late Aptian to earliest Albian representatives of Nymphaeales may have already developed a moderate diversity.
27756771|A phylogeny oc Solanaceae is presented based on the chloroplast DNA regions ndhF and trnLF. With 89 genera and 190 species included, this represents a nearly comprehensive genus-level sampling and provides a framework phylogeny for the entire family that helps integrate many previously-published phylogenetic studies within Solanaceae. The four genera comprising the family goetzeaceae and the monotypic families Duckeodendraceae, Nolanaceae, and Sclerophylaceae, often recongnized in traditional classifications, are shown to be included in Solanaceae. The current results corroborate previous studies that identify a monophyletic subfamily Solanoideae and the more inclusive "x = 12" clade, which includes Nicotiana and the Australian tribe Anthocercideae. These results also provide greater resolution among lineages within Solanoideae, confirming Jaltomata as sister to Solanum and identifying a clade comprised primarily of tribes Capsiceae (Capsicum and Lycianthes) and Physaleae. Stronger evidence also is provided for the inclusion of Capsicum within a paraphyletic Lycianthes. Solanaceae are a predominantly New World group, with several lineages represented on other continents. Apart from events within Solanum (for which sampling in this study is inadequate for biogeographic interpretations) the Old World representatives of Solanaceae can be accounted for by eight or nine dispersal events.
27756772|Traditional taxa that are non-monophyletic (paraphyletic or polyphyletic) on a molecular phylogenetic tree may be interpreted as surviving ancestors that are evolutionarily static in expressed traits but accumulating DNA changes used to track genetic continuity. In cases in which re-evolution (convergence) of such taxa is deemed improbable, non-monophyly may be used to infer evolutionary trees of virtual fossils reflecting macroevolution. A taxon tree or Besseyan cactus of the family Pottiaceae (Bryophyta) is presented as an example. Non-monophyly may be evolutionarily informative at the taxon level in the same way synapomorphies are phylogenetically informative at the molecular trait level.
27756773|Populations and species of Sphagnum section Subsecunda are morphologically variable and it is often difficult from studying field-collected plants and herbarium specimens to delimit species. Allelic patterns at 20 microsatellite loci indicate that three distinguishable gene pools can be identified among plants from Australia and New Zealand. All three species are morphologically variable along a moisture gradient and this appears to be largely plastic, without genetic differentiation among species specific morphotypes. Sphagnum novo-zelandicum and S. comosum appear to have monoploid gametophytes, are closely related, and are endemic to Australia and New Zealand. The former usually occurs at or above water level and the latter is an aquatic plant with extensive morphological variation, ranging from simplx to branched morphotypes. Sphagnum fuscovinosum and S. simplex are synonyms of S. comosum. The third species is a highly disjunct population of the s. auriculatum/S. inundatum complex of Europe, which has not previously been reported for Australia and New Zeland. These plants appear to be polyploid and the genetically and morphologically distinct from both S. novo-zelandicum and S. comosum. All three species had duplicated loci amplified by one of the microsatellite primer pairs. The Sphagnum species are now reported for Australia and New Zeland, with three of these being endemic.
27756774|Gagea trinervia and G. graeca, both diploid (2n = 24), share several features that appear unusual in the genus: white flowers, relatively late flowering, and reb bulb tunics. They are genetically rather close but can be distinguished with karyology and molecular markets (nrITS-region). They were indeed thought to be conspecific by many authors, however, exhibit major ontogenetic, morphological and anatomical differences which indicates a strongly divergent evolution. Gagea trinervia differs from G. graeca in having bulbils with stolon-like hypopodium, a regular sister bulbil at the immature stage, an unifacial, juvenile-like basal leaf to adult stage, few cauline leaves, few flowers and a low level of sexual reproduction. These two species make up Gagea sect. Anthericoides, the most early-branching clade of the genus, endemic to the Mediterranean. The closest phylogenetically is Gagea serotina, that is referred to the separate section Lloydia (Salisb.) Peruzzi & al. comb. & stat. nov.
27756775|Using plastid, ITS, and ETS sequences, we investigated the parentage of polyploids Tragopogon buphthalmoides, T. castellanus, T. coloratus, T. gracilis, T. latifolius, and T. tuberosus. One of the parents of T. tuberosus is a member of the Collini clade (likely T. marginatus) and the second parent is part of the Angustissimi clade, most likely T. pusillus. Tragopogon bornmuelleri and T. rechingeri are not likely parents of T. buphthalmoides. Tragopogon crocifolius and T. lamottei are parents of T. castellanus. Tragopogon latifolius var. latifolius is an allotetropoloid, with one parent from the Angustissimi clade (T. graminifolius or T. pusillus) and the other parent is a diploid or tetraploid from the Profundisulcati clade (likely T. buphthalmoides); one likely parent of tetraploid T. coloratus is a tetraploid T. buphthalmoides and the other one is a diploid T. australis (T. porrifolius ssp. australis). Molecular data clearly argue against the inclusion of this tetraploid within T. coloratus (2n = 12). Tragopogon tomentosulus is not closely related to t. gracilis. Tragopogon acanthocarpus is nonmonophyletic based on rDNA and plastid sequence data. Homogenization of rDNA repeats has occurred to varying degrees in the Eurasian polyploids.
27756776|Twenty-five years after the last major revision, the results of a molecular phylogenetic analysis have necessitated a re-classification of the Disinae (Orchidoideae, Orchidaceae). The small genus Schizodium, endemic to the Cape Floristic Region, is deeply embedded in the genus Disa and its generic status can thus no longer be maintained. We propose a monogeneric subtribe Disinae and a subdivision of Disa into eighteen sections and one nothosection. Excluding the latter, the sections are monophyletic, well-supported, morphologically distinguishable and are delimited to maximize the congruence with the previous classification. All 180 described and one undescribed species, as well as four named, natural hybrids are enumerated and assigned to sections and the nothosection.
27756777|A phylogenetic survey based on ITS and trnT-L sequences was conducted in the Campanula lusitanica complex, a group of annual species of Campanula sect. Rapunculus (Campanulaceae) distributed in the western Mediterranean region. Both nuclear and plastid data unambiguously demonstrated the existence of two non-related lineages within this complex (C. lusitanica and C. dieckii). The C. lusitanica lineage is monophyletic and comprises five species (C. broussonetiana, C. cabezudoi, C. lusitanica s.str., C. specularioides, C. transtagana) that have all been referred to C. lusitanica s.l. by various authors; the C. dieckii lineage includes only one extant species, C. dieckii. Furthermore, our data strongly indicate that the affinities of C. dieckii are outside of the Campanula sect. Rapunculus core group. Divergence times indicate that the C. lusitanica lineage most likely originated in the Betic-Rifian area in the late Miocene (Tortonian, approx. 9.4 My). In the C. lusitanica lineage a vicariant speciation pattern is observed in the recently evolved C. transtagana/C. broussonetiana clade (ca. 5.1 My) probably as a result of continental isolation caused by the opening of the Gibraltar Strait (ca. 5.3 My). Our evolutionary study strongly supports the taxonomic recognition of these otherwise neglected microspecies.
27756779|Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), a rapid, simple, high-resolution analytical method, provides biochemical profiles containing overlapping signals from numerous compounds present in cells. FTIR analysis of leaves of twenty-one species in four sections of Camellia (one in sect. Longissima, two in sect. Longipedicellata, sixteen in sect. Thea, and two in sect. Glaberrima) was conducted to determine whether they can be discriminated on the basis of biochemical profiles. The results showed that the spectra were highly typical for different species. A hierarchical dendrogram based on principal component analysis of FTIR data confirmed the morphological classification of the four sections proposed in previous work. Quantitative and qualitative leaf anatomy characteristics, such as pattern and size of epidermal cells, cuticular ornamentation, layer of epidermal cell, and thickness of palisade parenchyma and spongy parenchyma, provided additional taxonomic evidence.
27756780|Calcareous dinofoagellates are considered to be a monophyletic group of peridinoid taxa that have the potential to produce calcified exoskeletal structures during the life cycle, or that derive from such forms. Frequently, these calcareous bodies are excellently preserved in the fossil record and have received increased attention during the past three decedes with regard to their use in biostratigraphy, climate and environmental reconstruction. Fossil and extant taxa have been classified in various, partly concurring, systematic concepts, using character complexes of the theca, cyst wall ultrastructure and archaelpyle/operculum morphology. The significance of such character complexes is briefly discussed in the light of molecular data that have been accumulated during the past decade. Over the Years, the number of published taxonomic names has increased, partly due to nomenclatural changes. We propose that the entirety of calcareous dinoflagellagtes, and non-calcareous relatives dervied from them, is accommodated in a single family of the order Peridiniales, the Thoracosphaeraceae, combining the former segregated taxonomic units Calciodinelloideae, a subfamily within Peridiniaceae, and Thoracosphaerales, a separate dinoflagellate order. As a result of a meeting of calcareous dinoflagellate specualists, we outline major subjects that are in need of re-inivestigatin and-evaluation (an Agenda for Calcareous Dinoflagellate Research). In order to contribute to a consistent and stable nomenclature and taxonomy of calcareous dinoflagellates, we list 97 published generic names assigned to known calcareous dinoflagellates ion a nomenclatural synopsis, with species names indicating their typing and information on type locality and stratigraphy. We Evaluate the status of these nameswhether validly published and, if so, whether legitimate, a crucial first step for any revisionary work in the future.
27756781|The selection of a DNA barcode in plants has been impeded in part to the relatively low rates of nucleotide substitution observed iat the mosot accessible plastid markets. However, the absence of consensus also reflects a lack of standards for comparing potential barcode marketsi. While manyo publications have suggested a host of plant DNA barcodes, the studies cannot be readily compared with each other through any quantitative or statistical parameter, partly because they put forward no single complelling retionale relevant to the adoption of a DNA barcode in plants. Here, we argue that the efficacy of any particular plant DNA barcode selection should reflect the oanticipated performance of the resulting barcode database in assignment of a query sequence to species. While legitimate scientific disagreement exists over the criteria relevant to "database performance", the nation gives a unifying rationale for pororitizing selecton criteria. Accordingly, we suggest a measure of barcode ifficacy based on the rationale for prioritizing selection criteria. Accordingly, we suggest a measure of barcode efficacy based on the rationale of database performance, "the probability of correct indentification" (PCI) is left flexible enough to handle most of the scientific disagreement over how to best evaluate DNA barcodes. Finally, we consider how different types of barcodes might require different mehtods of analysis and database design and indicate how the analysis might affect iothe slection iof the most broadly effecive barcode for land plants.

27756783|Problems with the name and concept of the entity known as "Porphyra umbilicalis" that have led to confusion over its identity for more than 250 years are addressed. The name was first used by Ktzing (1843), who provided a diagnosis based entirely on material collected from Scotland by Scheele, but he later subsumed it under another species. Jacob Agardh (1883) transferred Ulva umbilicalis L. (1753) to Porphyra. We show that this nomenclatural problem can be resolved by typifying the names Ulva umbilicalis L. and Porphyra umbilicalis Ktz. Although we have located a Scheele specimen of Porphyra, there is no evidence that Ktzing based his description of P. umbilicalis on this material. We have therefore selected a specimen of P. umbilicalis from Scotland as neotype of P. umbilicalis Ktz. which fits both his diagnosis and the current concept of P. umbilicalis and for which we have molecular data. We also provide a revised diagnosis and designate the specimen chosen as the neotype of P. umbilicalis Ktz. as the epitype of Ulva umbilicalis L.
27756784|Juan Isern collected ca. 25,000 plant specimens during the Pacific Scientific Commission to South America between 1862 and 1866, but unfortunately he died the same year the expedition returned to Spain. In Chile, Isern exchanged specimens with Philippi, who later described three new species based on those collections which are all deposited at SGO. In the early 1930s, Jos Cuatrecasas worked intensively with the Isern collections at MA, where most of Isern's South American specimens are deposited. Cuatrecasas, Trelease, Sleumer, Standley and Yuncker described several new species and other taxa using Isern collections as type material. A total of 47 species, 21 varieties and 7 forms were described in 9 families, principally in the Asteraceae, Piperaceae and Gesneriaceae based on Isern collections. Here, the nomenclature of all Isern type specimens is studied for these 75 names. Lectotype specimens for the names of four species, three varieties and five forms described by Cuatrecasas and one species described by Trelease are designated in the present paper.
27756785|The name Arctotis plantaginea L. was published by Linnaeus in Species plantarum ed. 2, but application of this name has been uncertain and no original elements or illustrations can be traced. Consequently, it is still untypified. In early applications the name was applied to specimens of at least five species until Thunberg unequivocally applied the name to an element of the species currently known as A. semipapposa (DC.) Beauverd. Subsequently, A. plantaginea has been placed as a synonym of A. semipapposa, but it has nomenclatural priority over the latter name. In order to maintain nomenclatural stability, we herein designate a neotype for A. plantaginea, which results in its falling into the synonymy of A. angustifolia L., thus preserving usage of the well-established name A. semipapposa. Names in the A. semipapposa species complex are typified and nomenclatural issues concerning some of the names are resolved. In addition, A. macrosperma (DC.) Beauverd is placed in the synonymy of A. semipapposa.
27756786|Original material for the endemic Iberian species Odontitella virgata, initially described as Euphrasia linifolia sensu Brot., non L., does not exist. A specimen from Valorado's herbarium (LISU) is chosen here as neotype for the name of the species now placed in the monotypic genus Odontitella. The same specimen is selected as neotype for Euphrasia tenuifolia Pers., basionym of Odontites tenuifolia (Pers.) G. Don, the correct name for these plants in Odontites. In addition, a lectotype is selected for the synonym Odontites aragonensis Willk. Macrosyringion longiflorum, the type of the generic name Macrosyringion, is lectotypified here by a specimen deposited in the Lamarck collections in Paris (P-LA), since that French botanist was the author of the basionym Euphrasia longiflora and not Vahl, to whom authorship has hitherto been generally attributed.
27756787|The provision for conserved and rejected generic names entered the botanical code of nomenclature 25 years before the type method was adopted. All conserved and rejected generic names approved by an international botanical congress prior to 1954 were applied in accordance with circumscriptions. Bringing the lists of names into accordance with the type method resulted in the finding that many names had been unnecessarily conserved, Bangia Lyngb. among them. Silva's choice of Conferva fuscopurpurea Dillwyn as generitype must be rejected in favor of Pfeiffer's previous choice of C. atropurpurea Mert. ex Roth. Bangiadulcis W.A. Nelson, based on C. atropurpurea, is thus rendered a superfluous name for Bangia Lyngb. The latter name when properly typified applies to a genus that currently comprises a single freshwater species. Generic limits remain to be established among the phylogenetically diverse marine populations currently assigned to Bangia.
27756817|Patrocladograms that are logically inconsistent with phylogenetic tree hypotheses cannot be used to circumscribe monophyletic ("holophyletic") groups. Patrocladograms are graphs that asset hypotheses of similarity. Phylogenetic trees are graphs that assert hypotheses of common (or unique) ancestry. Monophyly is a concept derived from ancestry, not similarity. Further, patrocladograms that are logically inconsistent with phylogenetic trees also distort interpretations of character evolution, rendering characters homoplastic on patrocladograms that appear homologous on phylogenetic trees. "Patrocladistics" is simply another variety of evolutionary taxonomy that generates paraphyletic groups, resulting in classifications that are logically inconsistent with the phylogenies on which they are supposedly based. Contrary to the conclusions of Stuessy & Knig (2008), if one wishes to maintain a logically consistent system relevant to the evolutionary paradigm, there is every reason to constrain classification by branching structure of well-corroborated phylogenetic trees in a cladistic context.
27756818|Plastid microsatellites are simple mono/dinucleotide repeats that can cause in-vitro taq polymerase errors leading to 'stutter' peaks that reduce the clarity and reliability of electropherograms. As an efficient and automated barcoding protocol requires high-quality raw data, this paper investigates the suitability of the psbA-trnH and atpF-H regions of the plastid genome for automated barcoding purposes. Amplification of 92 individuals from species pairs and triplets was undertaken. Of these, 59% of atpF-H species samples and 36% of psbA-trnH species samples showed evidence of microsatellite-induced errors in electropherogram bae calling. The downsream necessity of human intervention renders these non-coding regions sub-optimal for barcoding purposes.
27756820|The system of binomial nomenclature and wider taxonomic paradigm forged by Carolus Linnaeus in the 18th century came from his original approach to understanding the natural world. It was also a product of environmental, economic, social, cultural, political and theological influences of the time. For Linnaeus the identification, naming and classification of different kinds of animals, plants, diseases, fossils and rocks had practical as well as theoretical importance. In his life and work he clearly demonstrates the 'scientific approach' including careful information gathering, exploration, empiricism, dissection, accurate observations and published descriptions. There is an inspirational use of morphological characters in comparative diagnoses, a requirement for material evidence to support hypotheses and the systematic and hierarchical organisation of knowledge. However, techniques for specimen preservation and analysis were limited and sample sizes too small to properly characterise wild populations. Thus he bequeathed artificial and 'typological' more than biological concepts determined by form and pattern rather than process. Species and genera were regarded as fixed, objective entities. This is sometimes associated with the supposedly stultifying effects of Aristotelian essentialism on Linnaean and later taxonomy. 'Natural' classification, as far as developed, was not phyletic but, instead, reflected Wolffianism, a modified creationist doctrine. Nonetheless, Linnaeus was the first to formally recognise the close affinity between humans and primates, a controversial idea later fully developed by Charles Darwin. Even so, Linnaeus did not always distinguish between mythological versus real creatures and incredible versus credible hypotheses. His understanding of 'cause and effect' was circumscribed by prevailing Lutheran theology and Cartesian mechanistic philosophy. Linnaeus was as much a working physician, agriculturalist and land surveyor as he was a taxonomist. Contemporary economic biology and biotechnology are anticipated in his animal and plant breeding and pearl culturing experiments. In the great body of Linnaeus' letters, manuscripts and books are discernable foundations for many other later disciplines. These include: anthropology, biogeography, bioinformatics, biomechanics, biological control, conservation, ecology, epidemiology, Darwinian evolution, ethnography, medical diagnostics, microbiology, palaeontology, pharmacology and phylogenetic systematics.
27756821|Using the French botanist Henri Cassini's work as an example, the complex relationship between characters, groups and relationships in the period 17701850 is explored. Cassini thought that classifications should be natural and that groups were to be based on numerous characters, although they would be difficult to recognize and characterize. For the most part he saw relationships between organisms as two dimensional, with one group directly joining two or more other groups. At the same time he asserted that the best way to think about affinities was as if they were linear, largely because this was most compatible with how he thought that the human mind worked. When he discussed relationships between individual plant parts he used words like type, analogy, and hypothesis that were rarely used when he discussed relationships between groups. In Cassini's writings it is difficult to connect his work on the analogies between plant parts with his ideas of affinities between groups. In the early nineteenth century zoologists in particular were developing various ways of thinking about organisms as being related indirectly, whether using abstract types or the taxonomic hierarchy to structure relationships. Similarly, Darwin's discussion of affinities between groups was separate from that on homologies between particular structures, but he saw relationships as being like a tree, with extant taxa being related indirectly by their ancestors.
27756822|Darwin's belief in branching evolution was based upon his familiarity with the taxonomy of his day. Facts from biogeography, embryology, and paleontology acquired deep significance because biologists had come to believe that natural classification expressed real relationships. Although Charles Darwin's presentation of his theory in the "Origin of Species", as well as descriptions of Darwinism after the Modern Synthesis of the 1940s, imply that establishing the causal role of natural selection was essential to proving that evolution has occurred, this is contradicted by Darwin's personal experience and by his own words. It is helpful to compare the history and logical structure of Darwin's revolutionary theory to the Copernican Revolution, for the moving Earth was recognized long before Newton identified causes to explain its motion. Copernicus saw that fixing the Sun as the center of planetary motion explained the appearance of the heavens better than the Ptolemaic system did, and Darwin saw that branching evolution explains the "truly wonderful fact" that a hierarchy of nested groups appears natural.
27756823|Linnaeus had it rightessentially, a classification should allow ease of identification. However, his classification had a significant shortcoming: it could not be used to determine relationships in any meaningful way. As the desire for a natural system developed and, more especially, as the implications of Darwinian evolution were realized, biologists recognized that a system of classification should serve more than a single, artificial purpose. What that purpose is, or should be, continues to be a point of contention. Application of mathematical tools to taxonomic problems led to a logical conclusion: natural classifications, employing a large suite of characters, could be attained by multivariate analyses. The concept of overall similarity was, perhaps too bithely, likened to both naturalness and information content. Pheneticists were not concerned with approximating phylogeny, but acknowledged that their classifications could form the basis for phylogenetic deductions under certain restricted conditions. Despite the promise of phenetics, the concurrent development of cladistic methodology (both under the rubric of numerical taxonomy, s.l.) shifted focus from classifications with high information-content, predictivity, and stability, to classifications reflecting hypothesized phylogenetic relationships. While a number of critics raised valid questions about the utility of phenetics and the underlying principles of proposed phenetic taxonomy, many criticisms consisted of over-simplified or unwarranted objections. Nevertheless, today phenetic analyses are de riguer for identifying fundamental units (populations, species) that form the bases for phylogenetic studies. After all, it is only natural that members of a species show greater overall similarity to each other than to members of different species, a view that can often be applied to higher ranks as well.
27756824|Classification has been a centerpiece of biology ever since Linnaeus, providing a framework on which existing knowledge can be organized and predictions about unknown traits can be made. But the basis of biological classification has gone through a series of upheavals over the last three centuries, from being considered a plan in the mind of the creator, to a neutral assessment of overall similarity, to a reflection of evolutionary niches, and finally to a phylogenetic mapping of the tree of life. This paper will consider this historical process, with emphasis on phylogenetic systematics (cladistics), and also consider where we might be heading in the future. It is necessary first, however, to consider the purposes of classification itself, which have not changed much over time.
27756825|Efforts of humans to understand the living world have involved observing and describing life forms, followed by interpreting that information and ordering it hierarchically for efficient storage, retrieval, and prediction. All human societies have done this. In an historical context, the Greeks and Romans emphasized observations. In the Age of the Herbalists (14701670), observations were refined, descriptions were elaborated, and botanical illustrations were perfected to complement the descriptions. The early classifiers emphasized development of an hierarchy of information. Linnaeus continued this trend and made the hierarchy more stable and consistent, but he relied mainly on his sexual system of classification, which greatly reduced the predictive quality of the constructed classifications. Jussieu in the late 18th century and others in the early 19th century focused more on increasing the information content of classifications. Darwin had little impact on observation, description, and ordering of information about organisms, but he provided a new interpretation of mechanisms for explaining relationships. Phenetics and cladistics stressed quantitative observations and descriptions, the latter also emphasizing evolutionary relationships. A paradigm is a way of conceptualizing about some portion of the world, i.e., a philosophical or theoretical framework. During this long period of more than two millennia, therefore, obviously no paradigm shift has occurred regarding observation and description of diversity. As evolutionary insights are not needed for the process of classification, these can only relate to the interpretation of relationships. Post-Darwinian phylogenetic systems interpreted the hierarchy of nature in evolutionary terms, and this has continued to the present day. From a broad perspective, therefore, the paradigm of classification in systematic biology has also never really changed. Different approaches simply reflect varying attempts to observe, describe, and order information about organisms.
27756826|The most recent classification of Hyacinthaceae subsumes all members of Ornithogaloideae into the single large genus Ornithogalum comprising 250300 spp. A combined molecular phylogenetic analysis of matK, trnL intron, trnL-F spacer and rbcL plastid DNA sequence data was carried out to assess possible alternative treatments. The study includes 70 taxa, representing all segregate genera that have been recognised in the subfamily and over 20% of the species. The resulting phylogeny identifies three, well-supported primary clades. Clade A comprises a grade constituting the majority of species of Stellarioides plus the Madagascan Igidia, in which is nested a strongly supported clade comprising Albuca and Coilonox; Clade B comprises Dipcadi sister to Pseudogaltonia; and Clade C comprises Eliokarmos, Cathissa, Galtonia, Honorius, Loncomelos, Melomphis, Neopatersonia, Ornithogalum, Zahariadia and two species of Stellarioides. The Madagascan Avonsera convallarioides is weakly supported as sister to the rest of clade C. Several of the segregate genera of Ornithogalum are shown not to be monophyletic although many of the lineages identified by the analysis correspond to lower level taxa that have been recognised in the group. Each of the three primary clades has morphological integrity and could be recognised taxonomically, either at the level of tribe or genus. Within these clades, however, many lineages are poorly defined morphologically and thus their recognition at the level of genus is problematical. Alternative taxonomic treatments are assessed but considerations of nomenclatural stability and taxonomic utility predicate that these lineages are best recognised at infrageneric level. We accordingly prefer to define the genera more broadly. Clade A is recognised as genus Albuca, clade B as comprising the genera Dipcadi and Pseudogaltonia, and clade C as the genus Ornithogalum. Monophyletic, morphologically diagnosable lineages within the genera Albuca and Ornithogalum are treated as subgenera and sections. A revised classification is presented, with necessary new combinations and complete listings of all currently accepted sub-Saharan species.
27756827|Conflicting phylogenies and biogeographic hypotheses for Aesculus L. were reevaluated using data integrating morphology, fossils, and DNA sequences. A more robust phylogeny of Aesculus was constructed by increasing taxon and character sampling to include 42 morphological characters and five DNA regions including rps16, trnHK, matK, ITS, and part of the LEAFY gene. Our analyses revealed three well-supported major lineages in Aesculus. These are sect. Calothyrsus excluding A. californica, sect. Macrothyrsus + A. californica, and sect. Aesculus + sect. Parryana. The relationship of sect. Aesculus to sect. Parryana + sect. Pavia is strongly supported and previously unreported. Relationships among the three major clades remained incompletely resolved. Biogeographic and divergence time analyses using DIVA and Multidivtime support a Paleocene origin of Aesculus in eastern Asia and western North America, and showed that the genus subsequently dispersed into eastern North America, Central America, and Europe. Our results support that Aesculus originated as an element of the Paleogene mesophilic flora in the Beringian region with multiple eastward migrations characterizing the early spatial history of this genus. This biogeographic history supports Trans-Beringian migration of plants in the very early Paleogene.
27756828|Maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of selected Goniothalamus and Richella species (Annonaceae) are presented, based on sequences of three chloroplast markers (matK, psbA-trnH intergenic spacer, and trnL-trnF intergenic spacer). The two genera are shown to be congeneric, and the nomenclatural consequences of this are discussed. Morphological synapomorphies for individual clades are evaluated, although a detailed interpretation of morphological evolution will require more extensive species sampling.
27756829|Coffea anthonyi Stoff. & F. Anthony from Cameroon and the Republic of Congo is formally described. Morphological, biochemical and molecular characteristics, isozyme diversity and phylogenetic relationships are discussed. The new diploid species has strong relationships with the East African C. eugenioides and the allotetraploid cultivated C. arabica. As such, it could be related to a progenitor species of C. arabica. The new species is self-compatible, being a rare character within the genus Coffea. This new small-leaved Central African species is of particular interest from a phylogenetic as well as from a breeding point of view.
27756830|Abies comprises 48 species with a disjunct distribution in the Northern Hemisphere. Despite the economic and ecological importance of the genus, phylogenetic relationships among the species remain unclear. The complete nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was sequenced for 31 species of Abies and its outgroup Keteleeria to reconstruct the phylogeny of the genus. The results revealed three small subrepeats with a motif (5-GGCCACCCTAGTC-3), that is conserved across Pinaceae, and the 298 bp large subrepeats, specific to Abies occurring in all firs. Phylogenetic analysis of ITS recovered nine of the ten formerly recognized sections (sects. Abies, Amabilis, Balsamea, Bracteata, Grandis, Momi, Nobilis, Piceaster, Pseudopicea). The results suggest merging sect. Oiamel and Grandis. The monophyly of western North American species is suggested with robust support by ML and MP analysis. A close relationship between European and Asian species is also inferred, but with weak support.
27756831|The phylogeny and evolution of the Arctium-Cousinia complex, including Arctium, Cousinia as one of the largest genera of Asteraceae, Hypacanthium and Schmalhausenia, is investigated. This group of genera has its highest diversity in the Irano-Turanian region and the mountains of Central Asia. We generated ITS and rpS4-trnT-trnL sequences for altogether 138 species, including 129 (of ca. 600) species of Cousinia. As found in previous analyses, Cousinia is not monophyletic. Instead, Cousinia subgg. Cynaroides and Hypacanthodes with together ca. 30 species are more closely related to Arctium, Hypacanthium and Schmalhausenia (Arctioid clade) than to subg. Cousinia (Cousinioid clade). The Arctioid and Cousiniod clades are also supported by pollen morphology and chromosome number as reported earlier. In the Arctioid clade, the distribution of morphological characters important for generic delimitation, mainly leaf shape and armature and morphology of involucral bracts, are highly incongruent with phylogenetic relationships as implied by the molecular data. No taxonomic solution for this conflict can be offered, and the characters named are interpreted as homoplasious. Although phylogenetic resolution in the Cousinioid clade is poor, our ITS and rpS4-trnT-trnL sequences contain some phylogenetic information. For example, the six annual species of the Cousinioid clade fall into two groups. Poor phylogenetic resolution probably results from lack of characters and the high number of taxa in this species-rich and comparatively young (ca. 8.7 mya) lineage. We hypothesize that speciation in the Cousinioid clade was mainly allopatric.
27756832|The species-rich genus Carex (Cyperaceae) is one of the 7% of angiosperm genera containing dioecious species. Dioecy is rare in Carex, only 12 spp. out of the 1,776 recorded taxa having been identified as dioecious. This paper focuses on Carex davalliana and C. dioica, the two dioecious species recorded in Europe. We investigated the nuclear (ITS) and chloroplast (trnTLF, rpl16) phylogenies of European Carex and identified incongruence in the phylogenetic history of both C. davalliana and C. dioica. This incongruence probably resulted from hybridisation. We postulate that dioecism was generated from hybridisation between species of opposite inflorescence morphologies (androgynous vs. gynaecandrous). We discuss the advantages of the separation of genders, taking into account the low number of dioecious species in the genus.
27756834|Recent molecular phylogenetic analyses and morphological studies have shown that it is necessary to revise the present morphology-based generic delineation of the lichen family Verrucariaceae in order to account for evolutionary relatedness between species. Consequently, several genera were recently described or resurrected, and others were re-circumscribed. As an additional step toward this generic revision, three new genera (Hydropunctaria, Parabagliettoa, Wahlenbergiella) and eleven new combinations are proposed here. A summary of the current taxonomic and morphological circumscription of all genera investigated so far is also presented. Several monophyletic groups are identified for which further taxonomical changes will be required, but for which taxon and gene sampling is presently viewed as insufficient. Clear morphological synapomorphies were found to be rare for newly delimited genera. In some cases (reduced morphology or plesiomorphism), even the combinations of slightly homoplasious phenotypic characters do not allow a clear morphological generic circumscription. Molecular features are envisioned as characters for delimiting these taxa.
27756835|Lathraeocarpa acicularis, a small woody Rubiaceae endemic to Madagascar, was rediscovered after more than 50 years. A phylogenetic reconstruction based on four plastid markers (atpB-rbcL, rps16, trnL-trnF, petD) proves that its previous position within the monogeneric tribe Lathraeocarpeae can no longer be supported. Our data clearly show that Lathraeocarpa acicularis has its closest relative among taxa of the Hedyotis-Oldenlandia group of the herbaceous tribe Spermacoceae sensu lato. The taxon falls within the Pentanopsis clade and is sister to a group comprising the Madagascan genus Gomphocalyx and the Afro-Madagascan genus Phylohydrax. A detailed survey of the morphology and anatomy of the genus based on our recently collected material of Lathraeocarpa acicularis is presented, providing additional arguments for the new taxonomic position.
27756836|This paper uses information from the 2,875 angiosperm species described from Brazil between the years 1990 and 2006 to provide insights into the present status of botanical collections and taxonomic research in this country. The analysis shows that approximately one new species is described every two days, mostly from the Atlantic rainforest and cerrado biomes. Most species described belong to Orchidaceae (297 species), Fabaceae (288), Bromeliaceae (280), Asteraceae (166) or Poaceae (126). The average number of collections per square kilometer in Brazil is 0.59, a number well below with the ideal index of three collections per square kilometer and indicates a need for more intensive collection efforts, especially in view of the land-use pressures causing loss of vegetational types before their floristic composition is known. We conclude that reaching an adequate knowledge of the Brazilian flora is a goal that can only be achieved through intensive investment in improving scientific collections and training human resources.
27756837|Angola is the only southern African country for which a plant inventory has not been produced to date. The lack of a country-level floristic checklist has seriously hampered the estimation of levels of diversity and endemism, and other conservation-driven initiatives. This deficiency was addressed in a collaborative initiative recently concluded among over 30 international project participants. This paper presents the results of the project that aimed, among other things, to survey the Angolan flora as part of producing a floristic checklist. The study revealed that Angola has a total number of 6,735 indigenous species, and a total vascular flora of 7,296 taxa (including naturalised taxa), of which 1,069 taxa (997 species and 72 infraspecific taxa) are endemic.
27756838|Lectotypes (61), neotypes (4) and epitypes (6) are designated here by 15 specialists for Linnaean algal names. These newly designated types support the current usage of the names concerned. All Linnaean names that have been linked with algal taxa are listed, and earlier but ineffective or supersedable type selections are discussed where appropriate.
27756839|The nomenclature of common chamomile, sea mayweed and scentless mayweed is discussed with reference to nomenclatural history, typifications, and the provisions of the ICBN. During the period 17531763, Linnaeus managed to mess up the naming of common chamomile, sea mayweed, and scentless mayweed, although he must have been very familiar with these species. Originally, Linnaeus intended to name the scentless mayweed as Matricaria chamomilla, the common chamomile as M. recutita, and the sea mayweed as M. maritima, but later he referred the common chamomile to M. suaveolens, the scentless mayweed to M. inodora, and the sea mayweed to M. inodora var. maritima. The major problem in Linnaeus's classification of the European Matricaria is his treatment of the common chamomile and the scentless mayweed. Matricaria chamomilla fits the scentless mayweed according to the original description, while the lectotype, Herb. Clifford 415, although uncharacteristic, is referable to common chamomile.
27756840|Zamia amplifolia Hort. W. Bull ex Mast., Z. roezlii Linden, and Z. wallisii A. Braun have been unnecessarily neotypified because original material exists at K or STO. Zamia oligodonta E. Caldern & D.W. Stev. is synonymized with Z. montana A. Braun. Zamia lindenii Regel ex Andr is considered specifically distinct from Z. poeppigiana Mart. & Eichler. The genus Chigua is synonymized with Zamia and the new combination Z. restrepoi (D.W. Stev.) A. Lindst. proposed, and C. bernalli D.W. Stev. is synonymized with Z. restrepoi.
27756841|The taxonomic identity of Festuca pannonica Wulfen (1809) is analysed, and lectotypes are designated for F. valesiaca Schleich. ex Gaudin (1811) and F. pseudodalmatica Krajina ex Domin (1929). The nomenclatural and taxonomic histories of these taxa are briefly described, and the lectotypes of their names are analysed morphologically. As the lectotype of F. pannonica is unambiguously referable to F. valesiaca, rejection of the name F. pannonica is desirable and is proposed separately.
27756842|The protologue of the name Juncus mutabilis Lam. 1789 is analysed. Among twelve elements analysed (six specimens, six figures), ten represent original material from which a lectotype might be chosen. This material belongs to at least three taxa, Juncus capitatus, J. pygmaeus and J. bulbosus. A specimen deposited in P-LAM belonging to Juncus capitatus is selected as the lectotype, thus avoiding any changes of name.
27756874|The drastic reduction of twelve genera to one in Mesembryanthemoideae (Aizoaceae) following molecular analysis is critically discussed. It is suggested to return to the previous classification recognizing eleven genera until more and better resolving data are available.
27756876|Rapid recent developments in DNA sequencing and genetic marker technologies call for the establishment of cost-effective, automated phenotyping assays for evolutionary biology and systematics, so that the effects of DNA polymorphisms and epigenetic changes on the phenotype can be evaluated. We discuss the use of digital image-based morphometrics in evolutionary biology and systematics with special emphasis on studies of taxa with porous genomes, i.e., taxa that do not conform to the traditional view of whole-genome isolation between species. We outline the phenomenon of the 'phenotypic mosaic' in taxa with porous genomes using well-documented examples from the literature and describe three important challenges arising for taxonomists: (1) character conflict in phylogenetic studies, (2) biased sampling of traits in morphological studies, and (3) cryptic ecological speciation. We demonstrate the use of geometric morphometrics using a combined molecular and morphometric dataset from an interspecific hybrid zone between two divergent Eurasian species of Populus, P. alba (white poplar) and P. tremula (European aspen). Elliptic Fourier analysis (EFA)-based morphometric data were collected for 527 leaf specimens from 84 trees with known genomic composition as determined by a set of 30 nuclear DNA microsatellites. In addition, to demonstrate the ease of scoring functionally relevant phenotypes via digital image analysis, quantitative differences in leaf reflectance were examined and their structural basis determined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The EFA results indicate a heritable inter-individual component for symmetric aspects and an important intra-individual component for asymmetric aspects of variation in leaf outlines. Symmetric traits displayed a striking variety of phenotypes in hybrids compared to their parental species, consistent with the notion of the phenotypic mosaic. Linear discriminant analysis of these morphometric traits revealed (1) clear differentiation between parental species and (2) divergence between recombinant hybrids and their sympatric backcross parent P. alba, mediated primarily by two P. tremulalike and two transgressive traits. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of geometric morphometrics to interrogate multiple independent phenotypic characters and detect individual traits affected by introgression and divergence in taxa with porous genomes. Digital image-based morphometrics holds great promise for large-scale studies of relationships between DNA polymorphism and phenotypes in evolutionary biology.
27756877|Generic boundaries of the South American genus Streptostachys (five species) are explored and compared with allied genera of the tribe Paniceae. On the basis of morphological, anatomical and molecular characters two new genera are proposed, Oncorachis based on Streptostachys macrantha and S. ramosa, and Sclerochlamys for Streptostachys rigidifolia. The phylogenetic position of the new genera and Streptostachys within Paniceae is evaluated.
27756878|Piptochaetium (Poaceae, Pooideae, Stipeae) is a New World genus of grasses distributed primarily in temperate South America, with several species extending into Central and southern North America. The genus comprises 36 species and 2 varieties. Morphological synapomorphies for the genus include involute lemma margins that fit into the palea groove, a bi-keeled palea longer than the lemma and protruding from the lemma apex, and fundamental cell sidewalls that are regularly dentate. The closely related genera Nassella (116 species) and Jarava (59 species) are also primarily South American, with a few species found in Central and North America. Published molecular studies to date have focused upon generic-level relationships within the tribe Stipeae, but none have included more than a few representatives of each genus. We present here results of phylogenetic analyses of these genera based upon combined DNA sequences of both nuclear (ITS) and cpDNA (rpl16, trnL-F) markers. Piptochaetium is supported as monophyletic in all studies, whereas Nassella is recovered as monophyletic only if Jarava plumosa is included. Infrageneric relationships of Piptochaetium are also compared to a recent morphological phylogeny of the genus.
27756879|Rupichloa, a new genus of Paniceae restricted to Bahia and Minas Gerais, Brazil, and including two species, R. acuminata and R. decidua, is here described on the basis of morphological and molecular characters. Analyses of DNA sequence data from plastid rpl16 and ndhF indicate that the two included species do not belong to Urochloa, in which they were previously placed. The affinities of the new genus with other genera of Paniceae are discussed.
27756880|Pennisetum (80140 species) and Cenchrus (1622 species) are closely related genera of Paniceae, both distributed in tropical and sub-tropical regions. The distinction between Pennisetum and Cenchrus is not clearly defined, and currently no comprehensive taxonomic treatment is available for either genus. Chloroplast DNA sequence data (rpl16, trnL-F region) were analyzed to test their monophyly, species relationships, and infrageneric classifications. Phylogenetic analyses of individual genomic regions, and a combined dataset, including indel-coded information, were performed under parsimony and Bayesian inference. Selected geographical, chromosomal and morphological characters were mapped onto the phylogeny to investigate evolutionary trends. Our results support a monophyletic bristle clade and the close relationship between Pennisetum and Cenchrus. Excluding Pennisetum lanatum, Pennisetum is paraphyletic because Cenchrus is nested within it. Sections Pennisetum and Gymnotrix are polyphyletic. Our molecular phylogenetic results show a close relationship among the domesticated species P. glaucum, P. purpureum, P. squamulatum, P. nervosum, and P. sieberianum, suggesting the potential use of these species in crop improvement. The Pennisetum-Cenchrus clade shows an independent reduction (x = 5, 7, 8) or duplication (x = 17) of the basic chromosome number from the ancestral x = 9. American Pennisetum and Cenchrus species appear to have originated from Old World species more than once. A core group of American species of Cenchrus with a basic chromosome number of x = 17 and retrorsely barbed bristles could be restricted to Cenchrus s.str.
27756881|The grass subfamily Pooideae was studied using DNA sequence information from the chloroplast (cp) matK gene3trnK exon and the nuclear ribosomal (nr) ITS15.8S geneITS2 in a sample of 67 taxa covering all of its tribes. Branches with strong bootstrap support are consistently resolved in both datasets, whereas discrepancy is confined to low-support or unsupported nodes in one of the datasets. The results do not reveal a significant role of past hybridisation, plastid lineage sorting or reticulation in the evolutionary diversification of the major lineages of the subfamily. The combined analysis of the plastid and nuclear datasets results in a largely well-supported pattern of divergence for the major lineages of the subfamily. Some re-alignments of tribes and subtribes are proposed and discussed with reference to relevant morphological and structural characters. We propose the recognition of broader tribes Nardeae with subtribes Nardinae and Lygeinae, Meliceae with subtribes Brylkiniinae and Melicinae, Stipeae with subtribes Ampelodesminae and Stipinae, and Triticeae with subtribes Littledaleinae, Brominae and Hordeinae. For the tribe complex of Aveneae and Poeae, the clear-cut split into two major clades and further resolution into some high-support lineages depicted by cpDNA is not contradicted by nuclear ITS and their taxonomic treatment as separate tribes or a single tribe remains an unanswered question.
27756882|The Brassicaceae family is of great scientific interest because it contains the plant model organism Arabidopsis thaliana. Currently, contemporary plant research activities expand to other Brassicaceae taxa. Despite that, the phylogeny of this family is only partly understood. The present study deepens our understanding of a family-wide phylogeny by using two new approaches in phylogenetic family-wide research. We used a molecular marker from the mitochondrial genome and utilised a relaxed molecular dating method. Our data generally confirms a recent tribal alignment of Brassicaceae. We present for the first time a biogeographical scenario for the broad-scale Brassicaceae evolution. We suggest that Brassicaceae most likely evolved some 19 mya in or near the eastern Mediterranean region from a common ancestor of its sister family Cleomaceae. The early Brassicaceae formed a lineage adapted to more open/drier habitats than its capparoid progenitors. The early Brassicaceae evolution was very rapid and the radiation was most likely driven by climatic changes that created open habitats and the well-documented expansion of open grass-dominated ecosystems. Moreover, our dating suggests that the radiation events correlate with an ancient genome duplication in the early history of the family, which is evidenced by recent genomic studies.
27756883|The "species pair" concept obscures both intra- and interspecific relationships and should be abandoned, evolutionarily and taxonomically. Based on our molecular phylogenetic work on the genus Roccella we are able to show for the first time that sexually and vegetatively dispersed entities in an anticipated "species pair" (Roccella galapagoensis/R. lirellina) actually form several distinct monophyletic genotypes, here interpreted as species in which sexual reproduction has been repeatedly evolved. The species accepted here are based on a phylogenetic hypothesis supported by data from the ITS rDNA region and an unidentified locus possibly related to calmodulin. Altogether 89 sequences from both loci were newly produced and used in phylogenetic analyses. The Roccella galapagoensis aggregate was resolved as monophyletic. The sister group includes Roccella decipiens (sexual) and R. gracilis (asexual). Based on the present data it is equally parsimonious to suggest a sorediate or a fertile ancestor to the Roccella galapagoensis aggregate. The ancestor must have arrived in the Galapagos Islands through long distance dispersal and have included the ability to reproduce both sexually with ascospores and asexually with soredia. Taxonomy, nomenclature and phylogeny are provided for five American Roccella species in the Roccella galapagoensis aggregate with geographical focus on the Galapagos Islands. One species is obligatory sexual, one is obligatory asexual and three species are facultative sexual/asexual. Roccella albida Tehler is newly described. Roccella canariensis is united with R. tinctoria.
27756884|Cladistic analyses are made based on morphological characters and chromosome basic numbers in order to test the monophyly of the nine series of genus Turnera (Turneraceae). Series Annulares and Turnera are monophyletic, and also series Anomalae with the exception of two species with unknown fruit and seed morphology. Series Microphyllae and Papilliferae should be merged, and also series Salicifoliae and Stenodictyae together with some species of series Capitatae. The Capitatae split in several groups and series Leiocarpae is unresolved. The Turnera sidoides complex should be separated into a new series. Biogeographic analyses show that the major diversification of the genus took place in the Chaquean subregion, with vicariance and dispersal events to other Neotropical subregions and Africa.
27756885|Sequence data from the matK gene, the trnK group II intron, the trnL group I intron and the trnL-F spacer were analysed for a broad sampling of the rosids and other eudicots. For the first time all putative genera of Dipentodontaceae and Tapisciaceae (Dipentodon, Huertea, Perrottetia, Tapiscia), as well as the recently described Gerrardinaceae were included in a molecular phylogenetic dataset. All genera were found in a well supported Huerteales clade. Moreover, with the rapidly evolving and non-coding plastid sequence data we were able to resolve the Huerteales clade to branch after Sapindales, and to be sister to a Brassicales-Malvales clade. Increased resolution and support among the malvids underscore the potential of plastid introns and spacers as well as the matK gene as phylogenetic markers in rosids.
27756886|Parsimony-based phylogenetic analyses of the neotropical tribe Helieae (Gentianaceae) are presented, including 22 of the 23 genera and 60 species. This study is based on data from morphology, palynology, and seed micromorphology (127 structural characters), and DNA sequences (matK, trnL intron, ITS). Phylogenetic reconstructions based on ITS and morphology provided the greatest resolution, morphological data further helping to tentatively place several taxa for which DNA was not available (Celiantha, Lagenanthus, Rogersonanthus, Roraimaea, Senaea, Sipapoantha, Zonanthus). Celiantha, Prepusa and Senaea together appear as the sister clade to the rest of Helieae. The remainder of Helieae is largely divided into two large subclades, the Macrocarpaea subclade and the Symbolanthus subclade. The first subclade includes Macrocarpaea, sister to Chorisepalum, Tachia, and Zonanthus. Irlbachia and Neblinantha are placed as sisters to the Symbolanthus subclade, which includes Aripuana, Calolisianthus, Chelonanthus, Helia, Lagenanthus, Lehmanniella, Purdieanthus, Rogersonanthus, Roraimaea, Sipapoantha, and Symbolanthus. Generic-level polyphyly is detected in Chelonanthus and Irlbachia. Evolution of morphological characters is discussed, and new pollen and seed characters are evaluated for the first time in a combined morphological-molecular phylogenetic analysis.
27756887|The relationships of Vitex and genera historically placed in Lamiaceae subfamily Viticoideae were investigated. Particular focus was given to some South East Asian genera traditionally allied to Vitex (Paravitex, Tsoongia, Viticipremna, Teijsmanniodendron) since progress with South East Asian Floras is being hampered by a lack of clarity in current generic delimitation. On the basis of maximum parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of ITS and ndhF sequence data we provide evidence that the Viticoideae is not monophyletic, its members being spread between a number of clades which include genera currently recognised as incertae sedis (Peronema, Hymenopyramis, Petraeovitex, Tectona). The most well supported clade, the Vitex group, contains Vitex, Paravitex, Tsoongia, Viticipremna, Petitia and Teijsmanniodendron. Morphological similarities of the genera included in this group are also discussed. In light of this evidence Paravitex, Viticipremna and Tsoongia are reduced to synonymy with Vitex, the new combinations being made here. The position of Teijsmanniodendron is not resolved and its generic status is therefore upheld. Similarly, Petitia is upheld due to a lack of neotropical taxa within the sample.
27756888|Despite what is known about processes that can cause topological incongruence among datasets, combined analysis of concatenated datasets (simultaneous analysis) without examination of congruence is still advocated and practiced. Although the danger in such cases of inferring the incorrect topology is known (and sometimes ignored), here I examine an under-appreciated effect of the combined analysis of incongruent datasets on molecular date inferences. Using simulated character matrices, a bias towards either increased or decreased dates is demonstrated that increases in its effect with greater proportion of incongruent characters. A general prediction is made regarding the behaviour of molecular date estimates based on the phylogenetic position of taxa that are incongruent. This prediction is borne out in a case study using real data from incongruent nuclear genes in Medicago (Fabaceae).
27756889|The Mascarene Archipelago is characterized by remarkable fauna and flora, mainly due to its high rate of endemism. The Dombeyoideae Beilschm. is one of the most diversified groups of angiosperms in the Mascarenes with 22 species, 21 of which are endemic. We used parsimony analysis of morphological characters to examine the relationships between the endemic Dombeyoideae from the Mascarenes and the members of Dombeyoideae from Africa, Madagascar and Asia. A morphological matrix was created including 36 representative species and 42 characters. Among the most parsimonious trees (MPTs) those with the highest number of secondary homologies were identified. The Dombeyoideae from the Mascarenes are polyphyletic and split into nine clades. Trochetia appears monophyletic and more closely related to Eriolaena and Helmiopsis than to Dombeya. All Dombeya taxa are included in a clade together with Ruizia and Astiria, which makes Dombeya paraphyletic. In terms of breeding systems the Malagasy Dombeyoideae are hermaphroditic, whereas those of the Mascarenes are considered dioecious. The polyphyly of the Mascarene Dombeyoideae suggests that dioecy has been acquired several times. At least five colonization events from Madagascar to the Mascarene archipelago are inferred. The evolutionary history of two lineages of Mascarene Domeyoideae seems to be related to adaption to xeric habitats.
27756890|The high species diversity and endemism of the Maritime Alps suggest that this region may have held several refugia during the Pleistocene glaciations. Nevertheless, this assumption has rarely been examined. Here we investigate the genetic diversity of Saxifraga florulenta, a rare endemic restricted to siliceous substrates in the Maritime Alps. Overlaying the maximum extension of the ice sheet during the Pleistocene, the current distributions of S. florulenta and siliceous substrates suggest the existence of two putative refugial areas in the Maritime Alps. Overlaying the maximum extension of the ice sheet during the Pleistocence, the current distributions of S. florulenta and siliceous substrates suggest the existence of two putative refugial areas in the Martime Alps. By using evidence from amplified fragment length polymorphims we aim at elucidating whether genetic structure of the species corresponds to this tow-refugia hypothesis and how this genetic information can be used to ensure its long-term conservation. Low levels of species-wide and within-population genetic diversity were detected, suggesting strong historical bottlenecks. Bayesian and principal coordinate analyses identified two population groups in agreement with the two refugia hypothesis. However, weak genetic divergence between these groups suggests that their separation happend more recently, and that S. florulenta survived and geographic distances implies that populations are not a migration-drift equilibrium and current levels of gene flow among do not appear to be sufficient to balance the effect of genetic drift. Hence, in future conservation strategies, special care should be taken to preserve both gene pools and prevent further fragmentation of populations.
27756891|In the course of molecular phylogeographical investigations in Androsace sect. Aretia a previously unrecognised entity from Crna Gora/Montenegro was identified as a genetically and morphologically clearly seperated lineage and is described here as a new species, Androsace komovensis Schnswetter & Schneew. It is restricted to a single high-alpine rock-cliff in the Komovi mountain range in Montenegro. The new species morphologically resembles A. Mathildae Lever from the Abruzzo mountains (Italy), but differs in the presistent, dense and regular indumentum of the leaf margin. Molecular phylogenetic data indicate that A. komovensis Schnswetter & Schneew. is not closely related to A. mathildae Levier, but instead is sister species to the Eastern Alpine endemic A. hausmanni Leyb.
27756892|Medicinal uses of Bryonia (Cucurbitaceae) have been recorded for over two millennia, and even today there is a considerable market for Bryonia preparations in homeopathic medicine. The long use as a medicinal plant has led to anthropogenic range changes, followed by naturlization and invasiveness in disturbed habitats, for example, in the United States and New Zealand. Here we use phylogenetic and phlogeographic analyses of chloroplast and nuclear sequence to infer the major evolutionary units with Bryonia as well as their geographic history. Major clades in the gene trees fit with morphological differences and probably define ten biological species. Five species are endemic in the Irano-Turanian region, which also harbons the greatest chloroplast and nuclear haplotype diversity. Eurasia north of the southern permafrost border during the last glacial maximum has low species and haplotype diversity, fitting with relatively recent recolonization. The provenience of the B. alba genotype introduced to the United States could not be narrowed down; the B. dioica introduced range changes, Bryonia chloroplast haplotypes show a clear geographic pattern, and the role of interspecific hybridization appears to have been limited.
27756893|Most species of the genus Crinum (Amaryllidaceae) are bulbous geophytes and grow in areas with strong seasonality. A few have abandoned their geophytic habit and grow inundated in rivers and possess leaves without stomata and seeds without buoyancy. Traditionally the genus has been divided into sections, based on flowers being star-shaped or bell-shaped. Analysis of DNA sequences of ITS and trnL-trnF regions has resolved a new clade of star-shaped Crinum species: the Crinum species: the Crinum natans clade of West Africa. From the rain forest of Cameroon two new river taxa are described: Crinum amphibium Bjor & Nordal sp. nov. and Crinum natans Baker subsp. inundatum Kwembeya & Nordal subsp. nov. A key to the Crinum species of Cameroon is provided. The new name Crinum exile Bjor & Nordal nom. nov. is proposed for Crinum humile A. Chev. (1950) non Herb. (1826).
27756894|ITS, rpll6 and trnG sequences, together with morphological data, were used to circumscribe the European problematic taxa within the Sciuro-hypnum reflexum complex. Strongly supported monophyletic clades sustain several of the target taxa as distinct species (S. reflexum, S. starkii, S. tromsoeense, S. glaciale, S. dovrense, S. latifolium). The segregation of S. nelsonii and Brachythecium glaciale var. gelidum is found to be inconsistent with our results and the two taxa are therefore synonymized.
27756896|Hypnea is an economically and ecologically important red alga including about 53 species worldwide. Here, we describe H. asiatica sp. nov. from Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. Specimens of this species from the northwestern Pacific have often been assigned to H. charoides. Hypnea asiatica is distinguished by percurrent main axes, branches with abruptly curved adaxial branchlets, and the presence of lenticular thickening in the walls of medullary cells. It is abundant in wave-exposed sites from summer through fall and produces tetrasporangial sori in fall. We analyzed three genes from three different genomes: nuclear SSU rDNA from 27 specimens, plastid rbcL from 51 specimens, and mitochondrial cox1 from 41 specimens, including putative relatives and H. charoides from Australia. All analyzed DNA datasets produced congruent trees in which H. asiatica was always separated from H. charoides. Network analysis of cox1 haplotypes indicated geographic structuring across the species distribution range. Although Hypnea was found to be monophyletic, the distant relationship between H. asiatica and the other species raises questions about divergence pathways within the genus.
27756897|Some authors have recently considered Koeleria lobata (M. Bieb.) Roem. & Schult. to be the correct name for those grasses traditionally named K. splendens C. Presl. Koeleria lobata is in fact the correct name for another species that has been named as K. brevis Steven or K. degenii Domin. Although the clarification of the true identity of K. lobata solves the current nomenclatural confusion between K. lobata and K. splendens, preserving the use of this last name, the restitution of K. lobata to its correct use would cause notable nomenclatural confusion thus making it compulsory to propose its rejection.
27756898|Nomenclatural types for 26 names in the Boraginaceae genera Caccinia Savi, Cerinthe L., Cynoglossum L., Echium L., Lithospermum L., Myosotis L., Omphalodes Mill. and Onosma L., validly published by Italian botanists from Domenico Viviani to Adriano Fiori, are newly designated. Most of these names apply to taxa of the Eurasiatic flora which are accepted in the modern taxonomic and floristic literature. The new combinations Buglossoides incrassata (Guss.) I.M. Johnst. subsp. spligerberi (Guss.) E. Zippel & Selvi and Omphalodes rupestris Rupr. ex Boiss. subsp. lojkae (Sommier & Levier) Selvi are proposed, and the new species Myosotis graui Selvi, previously known under the misapplied name M. ambigens (Bg.) Grau, is described.
27756899|J.G.C. Lehmann and H. Buek described 18 species of Lobostemon Lehm., in addition to making new combinations of taxa previously placed in Echium L. Some of Lehmann's Echium taxa were supplied by Olof Swartz in Stockholm who also provided Thunberg with the same material. This led to more or less simultaneous publication of some homonyms in Echium by Lehmann and Thunberg. Previous confusions on publication dates of Thunberg and Lehmann names are clarified. Author citations and priority of homonyms ascribed to Thunberg, Swartz and Lehmann are rectified. Many types are identified, including 17 new lectotypes (MEL, S, SAM, SBT, UPS) and one neotype. The role of Sonder in selling material to S while breaking off bits and pieces and supplying his friend Baron F. von Mueller in MEL is also investigated and the presence of Lehmann's hand on a SAM specimen is reported on.
27756900|Plate 3 (lower) in Micheli's Nova Plantarum Genera is selected as lectotype for the names Sphaerocarpos michelii Bellardi, S. terrestris Sm. and Targionia sphaerocarpos Dicks. Because no other original material could be traced and as Micheli's illustration is demonstrably ambiguous and cannot be critically identified for purposes of the precise application of the name (Art. 9.7) an epitype has been designated from Northern Italy. Spores of the epitype are illustrated.
27756901|The background to Friedrich Welwitsch's seven year expedition to Angola and the subsequent fate of his herbarium of 10,000 collections are reviewed. In typifying the approximately 1,000 species names based on his collections, it is important to know where the specimens were at the time of publication of the names. In most cases there are no holotypes, and lectotypifications have to be made. It has not been generally realised that Welwitsch lumped together under one number all the collections which he considered to be conspecific, which means that designation of isotypes is open to serious misinterpretation. Data added retroactively to labels by copying from Hiern's Catalogue may be erroneous. The collection has now been distributed to at least 24 different herbaria.
27756925|For some years the International Association for Plant Taxonomy (IAPT) has sponsored research grants in plant systematics to young scientists, predominantly from developing countries. At the meeting of Council, held on 12 January 2008 in Pretoria, South Africa, the first such meeting held in Africa, it was decided to review the programme and to provide applicants with advice on how to write a successful proposal. Guidelines for proposal writing are given here.
27756938|Needs-driven capacity building is required as a matter of urgency to overcome the present lack of taxonomists and systematists who are skilled in natural history and collections. This must necessarily include the training of the next generation of taxanomists, appropriate leadership for natural history collections and the involvement of practicing taxonomists to change the perception of taxonomy by decision-makers.
27756939|Halacsya and Paramoltkia are monotypic and partially sympatric genera in the Balkans, with no clear relationships among extant Lithospermeae due to striking morphological autapomorphies and scarcity of phylogenetic analyses in this group. The two species H. sendtneri and P. doerfleri show a strict selectivity for serpentine soils, posing the question whether this edaphic specialization reflects a common ancestry or a parallel process of adaptive evolution in unrelated lineages. DNA sequences from the nuclear ITS and chloroplast matK regions were generated from multiple accesions of Halacsya and Paramoltkia, and from representatives of 16 other genera of Mediterranean Lithospermeae. SEM analyses of pollen morphology were also conducted to test relationships indicated by molecular phylogenies. Parsimony analyses retrieved a clade of morphologically well differentiated monotypic Lithospermeae including Halacsya and Paramoltkia. ITS Provided a better resolution of relationshipss and showed the two genera to be sistergroups close to Mairetis and Moltkiopsis, and no affinity to Moltkia as supposed by past authors. Pollen characters corroborated the phylogenetic link between the two Balkan genera. Five further monophyletic clades were recognised: Onosma-Echium, Moltkia, LIthospermum s.l., Arnebia-Macrotomia, and Alkanna-Podonosma. Mapping the edaphic preference of Lithospermeae onto molecular cladograms showed that serpentiophytism as an obligate condition originated seperately in the clade of monotypic genera and in that of Onosma-Echium. In Halacsya and Paramoltkia it represents an early ecological synapomorphy which probably originated in situ from non-serpentine ancestors related to Moltkiopsis and Mairetis.
27756940|Campanulaceae area a large, nearly cosmopolitan angiosperm family that are well-accepted as monophyletic but whose intrafamilial and intrageneric relationships are controversial. We used DNA sequences of the chloroplast genes atpB, matK, and rbcL to infer the phylogeny of 102 taxa in 41 genera plus four outgroup taxa. Our sampling represents a wide taxonomic and geographic diversity from whithin the family. Results from maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses provide strong evidence for two major clads in the family, with the platycodonoids sister to the remaining members of the family, the wahlenbergioids and campanuloids. There are two clear divisions within the campanuloids that correspond well with the historical Campanula s.str. and Rapunculus groups of Boissier and Fedorov. The phlogentic positions of the Northern European species Wahlenbergia hederacea and the genus Jasione remain unresolved. Our results also provide evidence that the large, inclusive genera Wahlenbergia and Campanula are polyphyletic, and the smaller, segregate genera Symphyandra, Prismatorcarpus, and Legousia are not monophyletic. Insights are provided into the different biogeographic origins of several oceanic island endemics. Heterochaenia, Nesocodon, and Berenice occur in a single calde, which suggests a single colonization of the Indian Ocean Mascarene Islands. Conversely, Wabhlenbergia linifolia and W. angustifolia of St. Helena Island in the mid-Atlantic are not sister taxa. The Macaronesian taxa, Canarina canariensis, and Musschia aurea, which display convergent bird-pollination adaptations and with Azorina vialii of the Azores, woody growth form, fall into separate major lineages. The North American Campanulaceae also do not form a monophyletic group, fall into separate major lineages. The North American Campnulaceae also do not form a monophyletic group, providing evidence that these taxa are the descendents of multiple introductions onto the North American continent.
27756942|Phylogenetic placement of Triaenophora together with Rehmannia were explored with DNA sequence data from five regions (rbcL, ndhF, rps16. trnL-F, nr ITS) in two combined data matrices. One (rbcL, ndhF, rps16) represented a wide sampling across most families of Lamiales. The other data matrix represented two DNA regions partly unalignable across Lamiales (trnL-F, nr ITS) plus rps16, which proved to be variable enough to give resolution at a smaller taxonomic level in Lamiales. Triaenophora rupestris and Rehmannia are sister taxa, composing a strongly supported clade, which is sister to all representative genera of Orobanchaceae. Furthermore, Paulowniaceae and Phrymaceae are next to Orobanchaceae and Triaenophora-Rehmannia clade. All of the above taxa are only distantly related to Scrophulariaceae and/or Plantaginaceae (sensu APG II). Mazus and Lancea would be excluded from Phrymaceae. The resulting phylogeny is in agreement with other data such as phytochemistry and provides a framework for further investigation of character evolution in Lamiales.
27756943|The tribe Alberteae, presently classified in the subfamily Ixoroideae (Rubiaceae), has historically been an artificial grouping of genera. In the present study, phylogenetic analyses of the chloroplast DNA markers rbcL, ndhF, trnS-G, trnT-F and trnH-psbA as well as the ITS region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA, are done to assess the delimitation of Alberteae. The resulting phylogenetic hypothesis is highly resolved, with most clades strongly supported. The genus Alberta is found to be paraphyletic as presently circumscribed. As a consequence, we propose the new genus Razafimandimbisonia Kainul. & B. Bremer to accommodate the Malagasy species. The newly delimited Alberta is distinguished by having two calycophylls that expand after anthesis as well as awl-shaped stigma lobes. Razafimandimbisonia is distinguished from the remaining Alberteae by having dehiscent fruits and anthers without basal appendages. We demonstrate that the genera Airosperma, Boholia and Crossopteryx are not associated with Alberteae, as has previously been suggested. Alberteae is considered restricted to the genus Alberta endemic to Southeast Africa, and the two Malagasy endemic genera Nematostylis and Razafimandimbisonia.
27756944|The systematic position of the monoecious rheophyte, Sheareria (Asteraceae), a genus endemic to China, has been long disputed and never rigorously examined. In this study, two molecular datasets (trnL-F, ITS), plus morphological and cytological characters, were used to assess the systematic position of Sheareria. The broader phylogenetic analyses based on the trnL-F data placed Sheareria in the tribe Astereae with strong support. This placement was also supported by the lanceolate style, "Asterois type" ligule epidermis, yellow anthers, green achenes, and basic chromosome number of x = 9. Analysis of the tribe Astereae based on the ITS dataset showed that Sheareria and three East Asian genera (Kalimeris, Aster, Rhynchospermum) formed a strongly supported clade characterized by flat, 2-ribbed, glandular disc achenes. Detailed morphological comparisons indicate that Sheareria is more similar to Kalimeris than to Rhynchospermum. Within this clade, Sheareria is distinguished from other genera hby its monoecious breeding system (vs. gynomonoecious). Based on fossil and geological evidence, the development of monoecy in Sheareria is discussed. Within Sheareria, on fossil and geological evidence, the development of monoecy in Sheareria is discussed. Within Sheareria, only one species, S. nana, is recognized; S. leshanensis, a newly described species, is placed in synonymy.
27756945|The subfamily Eriogonoideae (Polygonaceae) comprises 31 genera of which 20 are part of the radiation of Eriogonum and allied genera in North America. The eleven remaining genera are all woody, and includes species that are vines, trees and shrubs. They are distributed in North, Central and South America, the Antilles and West Africa, and in most cases the number of species is not known, even less their relationships. Brunnichia is a woody vine native to the southeastern United States. In the past some authors have recognized species of Brunnichia as occurring in West Africa. Alternately, others recognised two genera, Brunnichia corresponding only to the American species and Afrobrunnichia to the African species. In this study two accessions of Afrobrunnichia erecta from Gabon and Ghana, representatives of Podopterus, Brunnichia ovata, and several other species of Polygonaceae are analyzed using three chloroplast genes (rbcL, matK, ndhF) and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS). Maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses strongly support Afrobrunnichia as sister to the remaining genera of Eriogonoideae; Brunnichia and Antigonon are strongly supported as sister genera. Based on these results, Afrobrunnichia is supported as a separate genus from Brunnichia. Podopterus is placed sister to Coccoloba.
27756946|Several recent phylogenetic studies of Rubiaceae have dealt with enigmatic taxa whose systematic positions have been previously unknown or controversial. We address evolutionary relationships in the Spermacoceae alliance (Rubioideae) with special emphasis on the Asian genera Mouretia and Neohymenopogon, here sequenced for the first time. Both genera belong in the tribe Argostemmateae and have persistent calyx lobes on the fruit in common with Argostemma and Mycetia. Other previous uncertainties are resolved with strong support; Saprosma is sister to Paederieae s.str. and Carpacoce is sister to remaining Anthospermeae. Our results further reveal some phylogenetic problems. Danaideae is sister to remaining taxa in the Spermacoceae alliance with high posterior probability, which contradicts results in a recent study. The uncertainty concerning evolutionary relationships of Dunnia and Theligonum is reinforced, despite a denser taxon sampling in the Spermacoceae alliance compared with earlier studies. We also demonstrate yet another example of the controversial correlation between molecular substitution rate and plant life history.
27756947|Atocion and Viscaria are two of seven small genera recognised in the tribe Sileneae on the basis of molecular phylogenies. The aim of the present study is to infer phylogenetic relationships among their subordinate taxa, using chloroplast (rps16 intron, psbE-petG spacer region) and nuclear (ITS and the RNA polymerase gene family) DNA sequences. Relative dating was used to discriminate among intralineage and interlineage processes that cause incongruence among different gene-tree topologies. Atocion asterias is demonstrated to belong to Viscaria, which contains three species: V. vulgaris (incl. V. atropurpurea), V. alpina, and V. asterias. Infraspecific differentiation of V. alpina is not supported by the sequence data. The traditional sectional delimitation of Atocion taxa within Silene is not supported phylogenetically, and Silene tatarinowii as well as S. hoefftiana do not belong to Atocion, as classified previously. Atocion contains six species: A. armeria, A. compactum, A. lerchenfeldianum, A. reuterianum, A. rupestre, and A. scythicinum (not included in our study). With this circumscription, Atocion and Viscaria, respectively, form monophyletic groups in the cpDNA, ITS, RPD2a and RPD2b trees, but not in the RPA2 tree, where such relationships were possibly distorted by ancient hybridisation. Hybridisation with subsequent chloroplast capture is likely to have taken place in the evolutionary history of A. compactum. Three novel nomenclatural combinations are made: Atocion reuterianum, A. scythicinum and Viscaria asterias.
27756948|Elaphoglossum (Dryoperideaceae) is one of the most diverse genera of ferns, yet it is noteworthy for lacking monographic studies for any of its subgroups. This study was an attempt to find a clade within Elaphoglossum with a convenient size for monographic study. The main goals were to determine what other species might belong to a clade of three species (E. burchellii, E. ciliatum, E. nigrescens) recovered by previous molecular analyses and to examine the phylogeny of the constituent species of that clade. Molecular data from three non-coding intergenic chloroplast spacers atpB-rbcL, rps4-trnS, and trnL-trnF, were used. The taxon sampling included 52 species chloroplast spacers atpB-rbcL, rps4-trnS, and trnL-trnF, were used. The taxon sampling included 52 species of Elaphoglossum sect. Lepidoglossa. Maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses resolved a ten-species clade (here named the Elaphoglossum ciliatum group), which included the three original species. Three of the species are endemic to the island of St. Helena in the southern Atlantic Ocean. The other seven species are all Neotropical, occurring from Mexico and the West Indies to southern Brazil. Species of the E. ciliatum group are characterized by laminar scales reduced to minute dots, cristate, echinate perispores, and resinous rhizomes. Other well-supported clades within E. sect. Lepidoglossa were recovered in the analyses and are briefly discussed.
27756949|Diphasiastrum comprises 2030 species. In addition to a number of species with a circumboreal distribution, several island endemics and putative diploid hybrid species contribute to the diversity of the group. To assess the integrity and relationships of the recognized species, a global phylogeny of Diphasiastrum is constructed using five chloroplast regions comprising ca. 9,000 bp. Six monophyletic groups are established. Accessions identified as hybrid species cluster in all but one case together with one case together with one of its putative parents. Allelic information combined with sequence information obtained from two chloroplast microsatelite loci is found diagnostic for the three putative parental taxa in the Central Europe hybrid complexes. Haplotype screening is performed on six Central European popoulations, from where one or more putative diploid hybrid species have been reported to grow in sympatry with their parent species. The most common parental haplotypes are identified in all populations. Additional intraspecific variation, restricted to single populations, is identified in all sympatric populations at very low frequencies. Taking the low degree of sequence and microsatellite variation into consideration, the acknowledged morphological diversity in Central Europe is probably best explained by phenotypic plasticity, ancestral polymorphisms or relatively recent events of reticulate evolution.
27756950|The phylogenetic relationships annd biogeography of the Asiatic orchid genus Holcoglossum (Vandeae, Aeridinae) were inferred from sequences of chloroplast matK and trnL-F genes and nuclear ITS regions of 25 taxa (12 Holcoglossum, 11 Aeridinae, 2 outgroups). Analysis of combined datasets with parsimony and Bayesian methods revealed that Holcoglossum is highly supported as monophyletic, including two debatable species, H. amesianum and H. subulifolium, and consists of three well-supported major subclades which agree well with biodiversity centers of Holcoglossum: one tropical subclade comprising four species, another forming a polytomy comprising six species restricted to the temperate alpine region of the Hengduan Mountains, and the third with two species somewhat distributed between the first two regions. However, these three major subclades are only partly in accordance with previous infrageneric classifications based on morphological characters. The lip lamella, long and conical spur and tapering stipe seem to have evolved at least twice in Hocoglossum, similarly the pollination system shifts has occurred at least twice. Vicariance analyses and molecular phylogeny suggest that Holcoglossum dispersed from tropical regions to the Hengduan Mountains and then radiated there as a result of the uplift of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.
27756951|Gentiana sect. Cruciata is mainly found on alpine mountains across Eurasia, with the greatest species diversity occurring on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). In this study, we determined the phylogenetic relationships between species within the Cruciata section to further elucidate the biogeographical processes governing these relationships. Phylogenetic reconstructions, based on both parsimony and Bayesian methods, were applied to data from four cpDNA fragments (&gt;3,000 bp) that were obtained for 39 accessions belonging to Cruciata and realted sections or outgroups. Our results suggested that all the species sampled within this section comprise a monophyletic group, but rejected al previous hypotheses regarding intra-sectional classifications based on gross morphology. Five clades were identified. The basal clade comprised three species that were endemic to the QTP. The clade that diverged second comprised three Central Asian species. The European clade, containing only G. cruciata, was grouped with the remaining two clades containing species from the QTP and central Asia. The biogeographic analyses and divergence estimates suggested that this section diversified initially on the QTP within four million years. Given the low genetic differentiation, most species/clades may be the result of more recent differentiation. These results together confirmed the long-standing hypothesis that alpine plants in Central Asia and Europe originated from the QTP and/or West China and diversified extensively after the Pliocene when global temperatures decreased.
27756952|Gazania is a popular horticultural subject worldwide and comprises 16 species, all from southern Africa. However, species delimitation is difficult as many species are morphologically variable. Here we present a phylogenetic analysis of 15 species of Gazania, based on DNA sequence data from four non-coding chloroplast regions (trnL-intron, trnL-trnF spacer, psbA-trnH spacer, rps16 intron) and two nuclear spacers (Internal Transcribed Spacer, ITS; partial External Transcribed Spacer, ETS). The phylogenies derived from the plastid and nuclear datasets were not entirely congruent, but data combination was undertaken. Of the 15 species sampled, only 7 are supported as monophyletic. Most of the remaining taxa form a large, poorly resolved clade corresponding to a large, morphologically variable species complex. Using a range of ITS mutation rates, the diversification of the genus is estimated to have begun approximately 6.6 mya. The phylogeny, in conjunction with the distribution patterns, suggests that this genus arose in the semi-arid to arid Richtersveld/Namib regions of South Africa and Namibia.
27756953|Little is known about the historical biogeography of alpine plants that are disjunctly distributed across the mountains of the Iberian Peninsula. Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and chloroplast microsatellite (cpSSR) variation were surveyed in the Spanish alpine endemic, Senecio boissieri, to resolve the causes of its disjunct distribution in the southern Sierra Nevada and Baza, centrally located Sierra Guadarrama, and northern Cordillera Cantbrica. RAPD analysis identified two divergent genetic groups, one containing individuals from the Cordillera Cantbrica and another comprising individuals from the three other mountain ranges. Chloroplast DNA variation was much more limited with only one of forty-two cpSSR loci examined showing polymorphism. At this locus the same allele occurred at high frequency in material from each mountain range. A possible reason for RAPD divergence in the Cantabrian material is its derivation from plants surviving the last glacial maximum in a northern refugium, isolated from the main distribution of the species spanning the area between the southern and central Spanish sierras. Postglacial fragmentation of the species range in southern and central Iberia would have resulted in the current disjunction of genetically similar populations in southern and centrally located mountains.
27756954|The genus Blechum P. Browne (Acanthaceae) is best known by the widespread tropical weed formerly referred to as Blechum pyramidatum (Lam.) Urb. (recently re-established as Ruellia blechum L.). Some species of Blechum have been transferred to Ruellia based on macromorphological and molecular data, but comprehensive study of taxa asssigned to Blechum is lacking. We reexamined morphological characters that have been used to distinguish Blechum from Ruellia including inflorescence structure and pollen and capsule morphology. Second, we conducted phylogenetic analyses including nine accessions from five of six species traditionally treated in Blechum (and that we here consider valid species) plus a synoptic sample of species of Ruellia based on the work of the first author. Results indicate that Blechum is nested within Ruellia with strong support. An alternative phylogenetic hypothesis of monopoly of Ruellia exclusive of species traditionally treated in Blechum was rejected under a likelihood but not a parsimony criterion. Based on morphological similarities, common chromosome numbers, and molecular data, we transfer the genus Blechum to Ruella. Third, we studied specimens and images of specimens of as many pertinent historical collections as we could acquire. This study resulted in nomenclatural and taxonomic renovations that include several new taxonomic synonyms (reduction of Blechum killipii, Blechum linnaei, and Blechum trinitense), two new combinations (Ruellia haughtii and Ruellia panamensis), one new lectotypification (Blechum brownei  subcordatum f. albiflorum), and additional recommendations for future typification. Based on our morphological and molecular studies, six species of Ruellia are treated as constituting the Blechum lineage of Ruellia. A preliminary key is provided to distinguish these species, but the Blechum lineage as a whole deserves further attention and fieldwork to determine the precise limits of each taxon.
27756955|Several lines of evidence (morphological, karyological and molecular) support the exclusion of both Sebaea madagascariensis Klack. and S. condensata Klack. from Sebaea Sol. ex. R. Br. (Gentianaceae  Exaceae), resulting in the establishment of a new genus Klackenbergia Kissling and two new species combinations: K. stricta (Schinz) Kissling (= S. madagascariensis) and K. condensata (Klack.) Kissling. Klackenbergia is endemic to Madagascar and is morphologically recognized by its inflorescence with long bracts and bracteoles and subsessile flowers arranged in axillary fascicules at each node. Affinities with the other genera of the tribe Exaceae (Exacum, Gentianothamnus, Ornichia, Sebaea, Tachiadenus) are discussed.
27756956|The species-rich neotropical tree genus Swartzia (Leguminosae-Papilionoideae) is a ubiquitous element in Central and South American rainforests. As such, it has been selected as a focal group in ongoing studies of the evolution and assembly of the neotropical flora, but these efforts are hindered by substantial taxonomic problems within Swartzia. The lack of a well-substantiated infrageneric classification has impeded much needed revisionary work on the genus, since the composition and limits of the various species complexes of Swartzia have not been clearly defined. A recent phylogenetic study of Swartzia with broad sampling of molecular characters and species illustrates the deficiencies of previous classifications of the genus and provides a robust phylogenetic framework for devising a new classification. Here we propose a phylogenetically based classification that places all currently recognized species of Swartzia into 15 sections. The sections, ranging in size from one to thirty-two species, are morphologically diagnosable and are hypothesized to be monophyletic. Thirteen sectional names are either entirely new or are applied at the sectional rank for the first time. A key to the sections is provided, along with sectional treatments that each include a morphological description, geographic distribution, and list of included species.
27756957|An artificial neural network (back propagation neural network) based on morphological and fractal leaf and flower parameters was developed for the characterization of three Banksia integrifolia subspecies and the identification of nine unnamed morphotypes. Results indicated that the network can be effectively and successfully used to discriminate among morphotypes using simple dedicated instruments, such as a PC and an optical scanner. The new method also as a complementary approach to botanical identification, being capable of separating all the tested Banksia integrifolia accessions and of creating associations between the known subspecies and the unnamed accessions.
27756958|Species identification is a necessary component of most studies of biological diversity, and computational approaches are beginning to automate it. In particular, leaves of plants provide taxon-specific information that has successfully been applied to plant identification. Prior studies have not investigated the number of leaves or the resolution of the digitized leaf image required to represent a species' shape. Moreover, the relationship between accuracy and the size of the leaf shape database, and methods to integrate automated approaches with more traditional dichotomous keys have yet to be explored. Here, I use a database of 2,420 leaves from 151 species to address these issues. Using distance metrics derived from Fourier and Procrustes analyses, it is found that a minimum of 10 leaves of each species, 100 margin points, and 10 Fourier harmonics are required to accurately represent leaf shape of a species. These results are used to assess the success of species identification from images of leaves: 72% for all 151 species. The tight relationship between database size and accuracy is then used in conjunction with results from probability theory to predict accuracy of species identification when dichotomous multiple-entry keys and combined Fourier and Procrustes analysis are used together. Combining these two approaches to identification can greatly improve identification accuracy. Open-source software is available to implement the automated distance-based approach.
27756959|Non-parametric bootstrapping is one of the most commonly used methods for branch support assessment. Unlike Bayesian posterior probability values, which are influenced by a priori data partitioning, non-parametric bootstrapping is usually applied to unpartitioned (combined) datasets. The resulting bootstrap support values are misleading in that they do not measure how well clades are supported by all the partitions, unless all partitions are equal in size (i.e., number of characters). Since most empirical studies include data partitions that are heterogeneous in size, our current bootstrapping approach for partitioned datasets (i.e., bootstrapping the combined dataset) is not adequate. Here I propose a simple modification to non-parametric bootstrapping that takes a priori data partitioning into account by obtaining bootstrap replicates for each partition separately and combining them in such a way that the size (i.e., number of characters) of each partition is taken into account. With this "corrected" bootstrap support value, characters from smaller partitions will have greater influence on final bootstrap values, and those in larger partitions relatively less influence than they would for unpartitioned data.
27756960|The limit for successful DNA extraction was tested by amplification and sequencing of an 200-year-old herbarium specimen collected by Adam Afzelius, a student of Carl Linnaeus. We amplified and sequenced a 800-bp region between 16S ribosomal DNA and the 3 part of the trnI gene (16S-trnI) in the chloroplast genome of Phaulopsis talbotii S. Moore (Acanthaceae). To test the replicability and to control for contamination the procedure was performed in sealed vials and with negative PCR controls. The procedure was also repeated in a separate laboratory. In addition, the chloroplast rp116 intron was successfully amplified and sequenced and the rps16 intron amplified. Sequences of taxa closely related to Acanthaceae were found to be most similar to the produced sequences. The results suggest that molecular investigations of other 18th century botanical collections are feasible and that molecular methods could be employed for comparative studies to extant plant collections. An important application would be to identify descendants or clones of Linnaean lectotypes by comparing DNA from these with potentially remnant plants from Linnaeus' cultivations.
27756961|During a survey of the historical collections stored at the Herbarium of the Facolta' di Agraria, Universita' di Napoli (PORUN), we found 170 specimens of unknown provenance mixed within the surviving Domenico Cirillo's herbarium (18th century). These 170 specimens were strikingly different from the rest and had never been studied previously. From an initial close examination, we suggested that they may date back to the 16th to 17th century, and likely have been part of Ferrante Imperato's historical herbarium. To test our initial hypothesis, we employed an empirical approach to assess the age and provenance of these specimens. First of all, we assembled the available literature regarding the history of Italian botanical collections and collectors from the 16th to the 18th century in the political context of those years. We integrated our historical reconstruction with results obtained by radiocarbon analyses of the specimens and mounting paper, and watermark and paleographic analyses. Our combined results are consistent with the hypothesis that these unknown specimens may have been part of an 80 volumes herbarium that belonged to Ferrante Imperato, one of the earliest natural historians of our times. Our integrated methodology is novel in the field of historical specimen research and was critical in generating our final conclusions.
27756963|The currently accepted lectotype of the circumboreal species Lycopodium complanatum L., or Diphasiastrum complanatum (L.) Holub, is a specimen of the related species L. tristachyum Pursh, or D. tristachyum (Pursh) Holub, mainly distributed in eastern North America and Europe. This lectotype, in LINN, is here superseded in favour of an alternative original element in the Celsius herbarium in Uppsala, supported by an epitype, on the grounds of serious conflict with the protologue. Thereby the traditional usage of the well-known name L. complanatum can be maintained.
27756964|Lectotypifications are proposed for the names of the following 36 temperate North American species proposed by Carl Linnaeus: Allium canadense, Amaranthus lividus, Aristolochia arborescens, Asarum canadense, Aster tenuifolius, Baccharis foetida, Bartsia pallida, Chenopodium anthelminticum, Croton argenteus, Erigeron carolinianus, Gentiana villosa, Hedysarum viridiflorum, Hedysarum volubile, Hippopha canadensis, Iris versicolor, Lonicera dioica, Lonicera symphoricarpos, Lupinus perennis, Lysimachia ciliata, Lythrum petiolatum, Myrica aspleniifolia, Oenothera sinuata, Onoclea sensibilis, Polypodium bulbiferum, Rudbeckia laciniata, Rudbeckia triloba, Ruellia strepens, Rumex verticillatus, Sideroxylon decandrum, Sideroxylon lycioides, Smilax lanceolata, Solidago lateriflora, Tabernaemontana amsonia, Tragia urens, Triosteum angustifolium and Verbena carolina. In addition, neotypes are established for six Linnaean names that lack original material: Agave virginica, Blechnum virginicum, Juglans cinerea, Magnolia virginiana var. grisea, Menispermum carolinum and Teucrium virginicum.
27756965|Several names in the widespread arctic and northern boreal complexes of Papaver lapponicumradicatum, P. nudicaule s.l., P. pulvinatum s.l., and related species are without identified or formally selected types. This absence of a nomenclatural standard has sometimes made the application of these names contradictory among authors. Lectotypes are designated for the following names: Papaver angustifolium, P. lapponicum subsp. orientale, P. minutiflorum, P. nudicaule var. labradoricum, P. pulvinatum, P. pulvinatum subsp. tschuktschorum, and P. radicatum subsp. occidentale. A previously designated lectotype for P. pulvinatum subsp. lenaense is rejected on the grounds that it was based on inadmissible material and a new one is designated. A holotype of P. nudicaule subsp. gracile is identified.
27756966|The widely used name Frangula alnus (syn. Rhamnus frangula) has in recent years been threatened by F. dodonei, an allegedly older name said to be published in a rare work by Pietro Arduino. However, from the context of Arduino's paper it is clear that "F. dodonei" is not a binomial; it just happens to look like one, and has no nomenclatural status.
27756967|In 1956, Louis O. Williams transferred type specimens of Central American and Mexican plants that had been deposited in the Escuela Agrcola Panamericana (EAP), Honduras to the U.S. National Herbarium (US), Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., U.S.A. With only a few exceptions, the specimens typified names of taxa that had been described by Williams and his colleagues in Honduras, who had stated in their publications (numerous articles in the scientific serial Ceiba and the book The Rain Forests of Golfo Dulce) that the "types" (i.e., holotypes) were deposited in EAP. This transfer, which was neither publicly announced nor otherwise previously well-documented, has led to confusion regarding the present location of the holotypes of many names. Details regarding Williams's transaction and an accounting of the 195 collections and 219 specimens involved are presented.
27757001|Four major taxonomical issues are commented briefly in view of evolutionary biology: classification, hierarchy, trees and nomenclature. It is argued that distinction between diachronous and synchronous classification schemes is of primary importance in taxonomy. The currently adopted classification of life is meant to be diachronous and Linnaean at the same time. This is problematic, because morphological and genetic gaps between higher taxa are the result of evolution; they are apparent only at a horizontal cross section of the phylogenetic tree and cannot be observed in time along the spatio-temporal continuum of populations. On the other hand, synchronous classifications would be consistent with the sharp boundaries necessary to set up a meaningful Linnaean hierarchy. Distinguishing Darwinian phylogenetic trees from Hennigian cladograms is just as well important. Monophyly-paraphyly-polyphyly concern the status of a group in a diachronous classification with respect to the phylogenetic tree, while cladograms can be logically contrasted with synchronous classifications. This necessitates introduction of new terms, monoclady, paraclady and polyclady, all referring to the respective conditions of groups of organisms in a cladogram. The existence of different and independent nomenclatural codes conserves an exceedingly obsolete view on the living worldharmonization of the codes with one another as well as with evolutionary theory is inevitable.
27757002|As a consequence of there being several ways in which observed patterns of variation in nature can be conveyed in a generic classification, long recognised genera have changed in size over time. The generic rank has its origins in folk taxonomy, where genera were homogenous units of relatively few kinds. In the era of Bentham there was a widespread preference for large genera, many of which were split during the 20th century. In a survey of contemporary (19982007) generic delimitation practice we found a significant dichotomy between studies that incorporate molecular data and those that rely exclusively on morphological data. The former lead to delimitation of larger genera whereas the latter in general do not. This finding spurred a broader investigation into what drives changes in overall generic sizes, neww data sources or new concepts? Two new data types have been introduced during the course of history: detailed morphology (anatomy, cytology) and chemical data (amino acid and DNA sequence data). Conceptual development has seen severa turns: from language and communication, through memory and stability, to evolution and monophyly. We argue that conceptual change has a greater impact than changes in data do, since new data must be interpreted and translated into a classification and since conceptual changes may spur a search for new kinds of data. We conclude that the current trend toward recognising larger genera is a result of a return to study on a broad scale, rather than of incorporation of molecular data.
27757003|A phylogenetic study of Dipsacaceae, a Mediterranean-centered clade in the Dipsacales, was conducted using nuclear ITS and three chloroplast markers (atpB-rbcL, trnL-trnF, trnSUGA-trnGGCC). This is the first molecular study to assess Dipsacaceae phylogeny in detail, and includes representatives from all major subclades. Maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analyses were carried out on the ITS and plastid datasets separately and in combination. For the most part, the ITS and plastid datasets resulted in similar topologies, and the combined data yielded a well-resolved estimate of Dipsacaceae phylogeny. A small Asian clade composed of Bassecoia and Pterocephalodes hooker is resolved as sister to the rest of Dipsacaceae. Scabioseae s.str. (Scabiosa, Sixalix, Pterocephalus s.str., Lomelosia, Pycnocomon) and a "Dipknautid" clade (Dipsacus, Cephalaria, Knautia, Pterocephalidum, Succisa, Succisella, Pseudoscabiosa) from the two major lineages within Dipsacaceae. Most of the previously recognized genera are recovered as monophyletic, with the exception of Phycnocomon, which is nested within Lomelosia. We discuss the taxonomic implications of these results and their significance for understanding character evolution, particularly of the epicalyx in relation to seed dispersal.
27757004|Within the palm family, molecular analyses have resulted in a need to re-evaluate characters previously considered useful to establish hypotheses of relationships among groups. Recent phylogenetic analyses of tribe Chamaedoreeae have shown that characters traditionally used as strong indicators of relatinship, such as presence of solitary flowers and dioecy, are homoplasious within this tribe. In the largest genus, Chamaedorea, published molecular analyses recover well-supported groups not previously proposed based on morphological characters and at the same time resolve some of the current subgenera as polyphyletic. In this study we further explore the phylogenetic relationships in Chamaedoreeae and search for morphological synapomorphies for the monophyletic groups recovered. Phylogenetic analyses of morphological, nuclear (PRK, RPB2), and plastid (matK, ndhF, trnD-trnT, rps16 intron, trnL-trnF) data are performed and morphological characters are subsequently optimized on the resulting topologies. Although most of the morphological characters included are highly homoplasious, the inclusino of morphological characters in the phylogenetic analyses improves the resolution within Chamaedoreeae, particularly among species of Chamaedorea. With the exception of Synechanthus and Wendlandiella, all the genera and subgenera in Chamaedoreeae are defined by a combination of homoplasious characters, none of which is unique within the tribe. Two of the seven subgenera of Chamaedorea included in our analyses, C. subg. Eleutheropetalum and subg. Stephanostachys, are supported as monophyletic with a number of morphologica synapomorphies also used in the original descriptions of these subgenera. Some morphological characters not used in the traditional subgeneric classification of Chamaedorea, such as leaf sheath structure and pistillode, gynoecium and filament connation, though homoplasious, are resolved as synapomorphies and, therefore, potentially useful when defining subgenera within this genus.
27757005|The North American genus Boechera comprises according to current taxonomic classification 110 species. Most of them are centered in western North America, with some species extending from the west into eastern North America and seven exclusively occurring in eastern North America. Past phylogenetic studies placed some eastern species as sister to western North American Boechera. Our analysis of cpDNA markers (trnL intron, trnLF IGS) and nrDNA ITS1 and ITS2 shows that eastern North American Boechera represent two evolutionary lineages within Boechera (cpDNA) or tribe Boechereae (nrDNA). Based on our data we suggest retaining the eastern North American species within Boechera rather than transferring them into a new genus. A possible migration scenario of Boechera into eastern North America is given. The Siberian Boechera falcata, the Siberian genus Borodinia, and the genus Nevada are shown to be members of a broader defined genus Boechera.
27757006|Two unispecific genera, Eccremis and Pasithea, are the only representatives of Hemerocallidaceae (Asperagales) native to the Western Hemisphere. The affinities of the former genus have been recently questioned. Phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence data (plastid atpB, ndhF, rbcL, trnL-F) spanning the Asparagales recover a monophyletic Hemerocallidaceae and strongly support the inclusion of Eccremis within that family. Eccremis is sister to Dianella and not closely associated with Pasithea, which indicates two introductions of Hemerocallidaceae to the New World. A taxonomic synopsis of Eccremis and Pasithea is presented and morphological character evolution and biogeography are discussed.
27757007|The identity of Jacobaea vulgaris Gaertn. subsp gotlandica (Neum.) B. Nord., hitherto considered an endemic to the Swedish islands land and Gotland, was investigated using nrITS and trnT-trnL intergenic spacer sequences and a broad sample of species and accessions particularly of J. vulgaris. We found that J. vulgaris subsp. gotlandica is a distinct evolutionary lineage more widespread in Europe than previously thought and may be a southeastern European steppe floristic element with outliers on the large Balitic islands. Our entirely unexpected findings underline the need of multiple intraspecific sampling in species-level phylogenetic studies.
27757008|The genus Kniphofia, comprising 71 species, has an African-Malagasy distribution, with one species from Yemen. The genus is found predominantly in moist temperate montane grassland and has its centre of diversity in the Drakensberg region of southern Africa. The genus has a complex alpha taxonomy and species relationships are poorly understood. using a multiple exemplar approach, DNA sequence data from the chlorooplast trnT-L spacer and the nuclear internal transcribed spacer region were used in an attempt to resolve phylogenetic relationships. Five cpDNA lineages were recovered, the geographic distributions of which correspond well with previously identified Afromontane centres of diversity and endemism. The data revealed that several morphospecies were non-monophyletic, and this, together with short branch lengths and many identical sequences within each of the five lineages, suggests a recent radiation. We additionally propose that hybridisation and/or incomplete leneage sorting may also account for this result. The nrITS region was largely uninformative as many taxa and samples had identical sequences. We hypothesise that Kniphofia experienced periods of range expansion, secondary contact and hybridisation during Pleistocene glacial periods, followed by contraction, fragmentation and isolation in montane refugia during the warmer interglacial periods.
27757009|The delimitation of genera within the Persea group (Lauraceae) has always been controversial. In an attempt to resolve the phylogenetic lines within this group, we analyzed ITS sequences of 61 species of the Persea group (Lauraceae) and 30 other species of Lauraceae. Several of the traditional genera or subgenera form well-supported groups, viz., Persea subg. Persea, and Alseodaphne including Dehaasia. The included species of Phoebe form two clades that are unresolved with respect to Alseodaphne. However, Persea subg. Eriodaphne (together with the Macaronesian Apollonias barbujana) forms one of the clades of an unresolved basal trichotomy within the Persea group, whereas Persea subg. Persea is well supported as member of an otherwise Asian clade including Alseodaphne and Phoebe. This indicates that Persea, as currently circumscribed, is not monophyletic. The affinities of the Macaronesian Pesea indica are clearly American rather than Asian.
27757010|Chamaecrista Moench is a genus of caesalpinioid legumes with about 330 species mostly from the New World. The phylogeny of the genus was studied using sequence data from nuclear ITS and plastid trnL-F DNA spacers, representing all six sections of Chamaecrista. Separate and combined analyses recovered the same major clades with high bootstrap and poooosterior probabilities support, except for the subclades of representatives of sections Caliciopsis, Chamaecrista, and Xerocalyx. The monophyly of Chamaecrista was highly supported in all analyses. Sections Apoucouita and Xerocalyx were supported as monophyletic, sect. Absus was paraphyletic and subsect. Baseophyllum was resolved more closely related to species of sections Chamaecrista, Caliciopsis, and Xerocalyx than to subsect. Absus. The monotypic section Grimaldia was embedded within subsect. Absus. Section Chamaecrista was paraphyletic with respect to section Caliciopsis and Xerocalyx. Our analyses suggest that the diversification patterns in Chamaecrista ocurred through an initial shift from rainforest trees to a more diverse clade of savannah shrubs. Within the latter group, two main subclades were recovered: (1) a planaltine and high-mountain clade characterized by absence of extrafloral nectaries and the appearance of sticky glandular hairs; and (2) a mostly herbaceous clade with axillary fascicled inflorescences and reduced chromosome numbers. This last group is more diverse in open grassland areas and includes many colonizers of waste ground.
27757011|In an attempt to improve the phylogenetic resolution in clades of the genus Blumea beyond what could be achieved with sequence data from plastid regions (trnL-F, psbA-trnH) and ITS, the 5S-NTS (non-transcribed spacer) was sequenced as it has been reported to show higher levels of variation than the former regions. 5S-NTS yields a tree less resolved than ITS and the plastid regions; the latter markers, moreover, provided more resolution at deeper nodes. When combined with ITS and plastid sequences, 5S-NTS adds very little resolution. The results indicate that previously published, morphology-based sectional classifications of the genus are highly unnatural. The three varies of B. hieraciifolia belong to different clades and should be treated as different species.
27757012|The Ranunculus auricomus complex is an interesting model system for studying the evolution and diversity of apomictic polyploid complexes. It comprises hundreds of agamospecies, usually referred to two distinct morphotypes (traditionally named "R. auricomus" and "R. cassubicus") which are connected by several intermediate forms. Here we try to elucidate the evolution of apomictic "cassubicus" morphotypes and we test criteria for different classification concepts by combining the information of molecular phylogenetic, morphological, karyological and population genetic data (AFLPs, amplified fragment length polymorphism). Phylogenetic analysis based on sequences of the nrDNA ITS and plastid data (matK, trnk, psbJ-psbA) suggest a deep split between the diploid sexual species R. notabilis ("auricomus" morphotype) from the closely related allopatric taxa R. cassubicifolius and R. carpaticola ("cassubicus"). The apomictic "cassubicus" morphotypes are not monophyletic, as one, R. hungaricus, groups with R. notabilis, which may be due to hybrid origin. Morphometric studies and ploidy level determinations via Feulgen densitometry show a transition from 4x R. hungaricus to the 6x apomictic hybrid derivatives of R. cassubicifolius and R. carpaticola. In two accessions, AFLPs and flow cytometric data suggest local gene flow among different apomictic polyploid morphotypes. Frequent facultative sexuality of apomicts may increase genetic diversity by continuous formation of new cytotypes, local hybridization and introgression, which obstructs the fixation of distinct agamospecies. We conclude that "R. cassubicus" and "R. auricomus" cannot be regarded as species but should be treated as either informal groups, or as (notho)taxa at the sectional level. To reflect the different evolutionary processes involved, we propose a separate classification of the sexual species, R. notabilis and the closely related species pair R. cassubicifolius and R. carpaticola. Based on the well-defined biological species, the apomictic biotypes can be classified as nothotaxa.
27757013|Ludwigia, a genus with rampant interspecific hybridization, is an ideal model for examining the impact of gene introgression and polyploidization on species diversification. We examined the evolution of the Ludwigia sect. Isnardia, which is a polyploid complex (x = 8) of five species distributed in North America. The phylogeny of L. sect. Isnardia was reconstructed based on sequences of cpDNA atpB-rbcL intergenic spacer and nrITS (internal transcribed spacer). Most L. sect. Isnardia species are polyphyletic at both loci, indicating possible recurrent hybridization, based on maximum likelihood trees rooted at L. sect. Microcarpiu, A minimum spanning network was also constructed to examine genealogical relationships among haplotypes. In the cpDNA network, haplotypes of tetraploid L. spathulata are nested at the most interior nodes, suggesting a parental genome origin of an extinct diplois or an unsampled extant diploid with a DD cytotype. Allopolyploid L. arcuata contributed its cpDNA to hexaploid L. repens and L. brevipes. ITS haplotypes of diploid L. palustris were clustered with L. spathulata, suggesting L. palustris as the paternal genome donor. Ludwigia brevipes may have arisen via bi-directional hybridization between L. palustris and L. arcuata followed by polyploidy. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses using molecular markers with different inheritance modes provided sufficient insights into the reticulate evolution of the species of L. sect. Isnardia. Interspecific hybridization and polyploidy play a key role in the species evolution in L. sect. Isnardia.
27757014|Platycrater arguta (Hydrangeaceae) is a small deciduous shrub of the Sino-Japanese floristic region, where it occurs in montane sites mostly covered with warm-temperate deciduous forest. This sole representative of its genus contains two varieties dijunctly distributed between East China (var. sinensis) and South Japan (var. arguta). To illuminate the biogeographic and demographic history of this rare species, we conducted a survey of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequence variation (trnD-trnE, trnH-psbA) within and among twelve populations (four from China, eight from Japan, 129 individuals in total) representing the overall distributional range of the species. Based on a total of 19 haplotypes identified, P. arguta was found to harbor surprisingly high levels of haplotype and nucleotide diversity (hT = 0.882; T = 0.00475), possibly associated with its lon gevolutionary history. Spatial analysis of molecular variance found two regional phylogroups, corresponding to var. sinensis and var. arguta, and supported by genealogical (unrooted network) analysis of haplotypes. Using a coalescent-based model of 'divergence by isolation with migration', the likely vicariant origin of these varieties was dated to the mid-Pleistocene (ca. 0.89 mya). Very similar haplotype mismatch distributions indicate that var. sinensis and var. arguta underwent past demographic growth almost simultaneously (dated to ca. 0.43 and 0.45 mya, respectively), suggesting climate-induced expansion. However, var. sinensis likely experienced a mere demographic expansion in a narrowly circumscribed mountain rante, while var. arguta underwent a spatial northward expansion that might have consisted of a series of bottlenecks, leading to genetically impoverished populations that most likely derived from initial population(s) in southern Kyushu. Our results endorse the recognition of two 'evolutionarily significant units' within P. arguta, corresponding to var. sinensis from East China and var. arguta from South Japan.
27757015|Cephalaria squamiflora is a chamaephyte restricted to rupicolous habitats in islands of the Western (Balearic Islands, Sardinia) and Eastern MEditerranean (Crete and few Aegean islands). Four narrowly distributed races (subspp. squamiflora, mediterranea, ebusitana, balearica) have been described to encompass the morphological variation within the species. We have used nuclear ribosomal ITS and cpDNA sequences to assess how the patterns of molecular differentiation are related to taxonomic and geographic boundaries. Extensive intragenomic ITS variation was detected in samples from all territories, the average sequence divergence among cloned ribotypes was 1.339%. The parsimony network of cloned ITS sequences suggests a split between Eastern and Western Mediterranean accessions. Chloroplast DNA sequences showed five distinct haplotypes, only one of which was shared between islands (Majorca and Sardinia). Both nuclear and cpDNA markers supported the monophyly of the C. squamiflora complex and identified a highly structured pattern of molecular variation composed by sister monophyletic lineages that mirror major biogeographic units (Western and Eastern Mediterranean). The molecular evidence supports the hypotheses that vicariance events linked to the geological history of the region or dispersal across the Mediterranean may explain the distribution of the complex.
27757016|A typical vascular land-plant consists of ten to twelve definable organs. Most plant fosils have been disarticulated into their component organs, which ust therfore be correlated if the fossil platn is to be understood holistically and compared with its presumed descendants in the extant flora. The resulting conceptually reconstructed whole-plants are the crown jewels of palaeobotany, as they permit full morphological comparison with extant plants and provide templates that guide through reciprocal illumination further attempts at reconstruction. Each of the three lines of evidence facilitating whole-plant reconstruction (association/dissociation, morphological similarity and organic connection) yields only a probability statement that the organs in question have been successfully correlated. Disarticulation means (1) that phenotypic variation can be studied only at the level of individual organs, and (2) that in order to be distinguished from all other kinds of the same organ, an organ must bear a unique morphological character state (autapomorphy). In our terminology, each definable kind of organ is an organ-species. The few organ-species perceived as possessing autapomorphies (and thus as unique) are termed autapospecies, whereas the remaining organ-species characterise more than one whole-plant species and hence are termed form-species. The distinction between autapospecies and form-species is dependent on the rnage of taxa sampled and is wholly character-based; the age of the fossils under comparison is irrelevant, and the state of preservation is relevant only through its influence on the range of characters than can realistically be scored. None of the many other species concepts recognised by (palaeo) biologists is applicable to fossil plants. Our ability to apply this phylogenetically-inspired approach and terminology to formal taxonomy has been increasingly compromised by modifications to successive editions of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, culminating in the 2001 and 2006 Codes which reduced palaeobotanical provision to the fatally over-generalised 'morphotaxon' concept. A more conceptually rigorous, palaeobotanically informed revision of the Code, placing nomenclature more clearly in the service of taxonomy, would strenthen the crucial rodes of reconstructed plants within palaeobotany and of palaeobotany within 21st Century science.
27757018|A taxonomic survey of the relict and poorly known circum-Mediterranean Anagyris (Fabaceae) was conducted using a total evidence principal approach based on morphological and molecular data. Statistical analysis of both qualitative and quantitative morphological and chemically-derived traits allowed us to separate the Mediterranean A. foetida and the Canarian A. latifolia as independent species. Newly analyzed traits relating to the odour of leaves, number of inflorescences per branch, colour of fresh calyx, and degree of corolla opening, were diagnostic for identifying these two previously almost indistinguishable taxa. Significant differences in quantitative morphometric traits indicate that vegetative and floral characters are overall larger in A. latifolia than in A. foetida, supporting the hypothesis of increased size and woodiness of Macaroneisan endemic plants compared to the reduced sizes of thier continental counterparts adapted to the more xeric Mediterranean climate. Combined plastid trnLF and nuclear ribosomal ITS data recovered a monophyletic origin of Anagyris within the central-western Eurasian Thermopsideae clade and its split into two lineages. The dated divergences of the Anagyris lineages, calculated by Bayesian relaxed-clock methods with the combined sequence data, showed that Anagyris diverged in the late Miocene (8.2  4.5 Ma), and that the origin of A. foetida (3.6  3.2 Ma) pre-dated that of A. latifolia (1.9  2.1 Ma).
27757019|A phylogenetic and karyological analysis of the small and poorly known genus Cerinthe L. (Boraginaceae-Lithospermeae) was performed using ITS sequences and standard chromosomal techniques. All taxa are diploid with 2n = 16 or 2n = 18 and show a variable degree of infraspecific variation, in particular in the polymorphic C. major and C. minor. Change in base number is associated with an early split between the two well-supported clades of C. major, corresponding to Cerinthe sect. Cerinthe, and that of all other taxa belonging to C. sect. Ceranthe, with the base x = 8 found only in the strictly annual C. major group, and x = 9 in the other five species of the genus: C. minor, C. glabra, C. tenuiflora, C. retorta and C. palaestina. The latter section is subdivided into the E Mediterranean, annual lineage of C. palaestinaC. retorta and the mainly continental, perennial group of C. minorC. glabra, the sister of which is the Corsican endemic C. tenuiflora. The hypothesis that x = 9 represents the primary haploid number and x = 8 is derived through descending aneuploidy, is discussed. A taxonomic revision of the genus is provided and the following formal taxonomic changes are proposed: C. major L. subsp. oranensis (Batt.) Selvi & Cecchi, stat. nov.; C. major L. subsp. purpurascens (Boiss.) Selvi & Cecchi, stat. nov.; C. minor L. subsp. cleiostoma (Boiss. & Sprun.) Selvi & Cecchi, stat. nov. Cerinthe tenuiflora, C. retorta and the poorly known C. palaestina are well-defined species with little internal variation.
27757020|Papaver alpinum s.l. is an extraordinary polymorphic taxon distributed throughout southern and central European mountain ranges. We tested previous hypotheses about relationships and taxonomical status of the numerous described taxa within this species or species group by applying different molucular approaches. In addition we re-evaluated morphological characters used in previous taxonomic treatments in the light of the molecular results. The ancestral sequences haplotypes were often characterised by haplotypes directly derived from the central haplotypes involving one or two mutational steps. The AFLP data corroborated the pattern of a 'centrifugal radiation' and additionally showed that most populations were genetically distinct, presumably due to the effect of genetic drift in small and isolated populations. The morphological data did not reveal clear patterns of variation; only the Pyrenean and Sierra Nevada populations differed in two non-overlapping and presumably independent characters. Altogether, our study implies that most previous taxonomic concepts of P. alpinum s.l. were hightly artificial, and that eigher nearly all populations have to be raised to some taxonomic rank or that, preferably, no infraspecific taxa should be recognised at all. The only segregate possibly deserving taxonomic rank, based on both morphology and genetics, is the Iberian P. alpinum subsp. lapeyrousianum.
27757021|Salix fragilis L. is lectotypified and S. rubens Schrank, S. decipiens Hoffm. and S. fragilis L. var. decipiens W.D.J. Koch are confirmed as synonyms of S. fragilis. A new species, S. euxina I.V. Belyaeva, is described.
27757022|In 1910 Houlbert validly published five names for wood morphogenera: Abietoxylon, Ambaroxylon, Cupressoxylon, Juniperoxylon and Taxoxylon. The material on which these five names were based has never been reviewed and was considered as lost. We located the repository of Houlbert's material, and had the opportunity to study original slides. However slides are lacking for two of these five morphogenera (Cupressoxylon, Juniperoxylon). We were able to determine which slides were used for the original illustrations for the remaining three genera and to choose lectotypes. Only short descriptions generico-specifica were given by Houlbert for these names, without any details of characteristic featurers. Taxonomic reappraisal of the material on which the names are based provided evidence that their systematic relationships are dubious since sample preservation is poor and Houlbert misinterpreted some crystallographic features as features of the wood structure. We therefore advise against the use of the names Abietoxylon, Ambaroxylon and Taxoxylon. From our observations and the original descriptions Houlbert's type samples for Abietoxylon, Cupressoxylon, Juniperoxylon and Taxoxylon very probably belong to a single morphogenus.
27757023|The nothogeneric name Chiranthomontodendron is proposed to accomodate an artificial hybrid between species of Chiranthodendron and Fremontodendron, and the nothospecies Chiranthomontodendron lenzil is described from cultivated material.
27757024|The typification of eleven Linnaean names of taxa belonging to the current circumscription of Liliaceae is discussed. Lectotypes are designated from the Linnaean herbarium at LINN (Lilium bulbiferum, L. candidum, L. martagon), the Burser herbarium at UPS (Bulbocodium serotinum, Fritillaria pyrenaica, Lilium bulbiferum), the Van Royen Herbarium at L (Fritillaria persica, Lilium chalcedonicum, Uvularia amplexifolia), the Clifford Herbarium at BM (Lilium pomponium) and from the Sloane herbarium in BM-SL (Bulbocodium autumnale). A specimen in BM is designated as the neotype of Lilium camschatcense. Each type choice maintains the present usage of the corresponding Linnaean name.
27757025|Confusion in current botanical literature about the correct spelling of the specific epithet of the important crop weed referred to as either Echinochloa colona or E. colonum is resolved in favour of E. colona. The use of "colonus" as an adjective is not found in classical Latin dictionaries published since the latter part of the 19th century but is found in dictionaries, listed here, published between the late 17th and early 19th centuries. Linnaeus and other early botanists were quite in order to adopt "colonus" as an adjective and decline it according to the gender of the generic name, as in Panicum colonum L. and Echinochloa colona (L.) Link.
27757045|The current edition of the International code of botanical nomenclature (Vienna Code) accepts cultures of fungi and algae as types provided that they are preserved in a metabolically inactive state. In this article the authors outline a procedure for cryopreserving type cultures at ultra-low temperatures (&lt;135C), thus ensuring that the material is held in a stable, metabolically inactive state. This procedure would allow direct access to live ex-type cultures, facilitating traditional research as well as molecular, metabolomic and proteomic studies.
27757046|Sequences of nuclear ribosomal DNA internal (ITS) and external (ETS) transcribed spacers were used to generate a phylogeny of Acacia Mill. s.str. (synonyms: Acacia subg. Phyllodineae (DC.) Seringe; Racosperma Mart.). This study included 109 exemplar taxa from all seven sections recognised in previous classifications, and represents the largest sampling of diversity for molecular phylogenetics of Acacia s.str. undertaken so far. Four main clades were identified from the combined dataset of ITS and ETS using parsimony and Bayesian analyses. Two of these clades consist mostly of uninerved phyllodinous taxa assigned to sect. Phyllodineae. One clade includes taxa related to A. victoriae and A. pyrifolia, and the second comprises taxa in the A. murrayana species group. These taxa occur predominantly in semi-arid and arid regions. Relationships also resolve the previously identified Pulchelloidea clade, which includes members of sects. Pulchellae, Alatae, Phyllodineae and Lycopodiifoliae. A large clade with limited phylogenetic resolution was also identified (the "p.u.b. clade"). This is an assemblage of plurinerved and uninerved phyllodinous taxa and also bi-pinnate taxa from sect. Botrycephalae. Clades are discussed with reference to morphological characters, and while some morphological states are correlated with clades, including seedling ontogeny, inflorescence and phyllode nerves, clear synapomorphies remain to be identified. Traditional classifications of Acacia s.str. are artificial and a preliminary informal classification based on phylogenetic relationships within Acacia s.str. is proposed.
27757047|The banana family (Musaceae s.str.; Zingiberales), an economically important tropical group of plants, includes three genera, Musa, Ensete and Musella, and possibly 41 species. We performed phylogenetic analyses of a total of 39 accessions covering 28 species in the Musaceae and five outgroup species using nuclear ribosomal ITS and chloroplast trnL-F sequences. Outgroups were chosen from the closely related families Lowiaceae, Strelitziaceae, and Heliconiaceae. Our results suggest that Musaceae s.str. is monophyletic. Three main internal clades are well-supported within the family. The genus Musa is comprised of two of these clades, and Musella a plus Ensete make-up the third clade. The sectional classification system of Musa based on chromosome numbers is not supported by DNA sequence evidence. Both inflorescence orientation (erect or pendent) and chromosomal number in Musa, which were characters traditionally thought to be diagnostic in sectional classification, are homoplasious traits in the family. The disjunct distribution of living members of the genus Ensete in tropical Asia and Africa with a fossil species described from the Eocene of Oregon in North America may be an example of the distributional retreat of the Boreal Tropics. The phylogenetic position of the monospecific Musella as sister to the African clade of Ensete suggests that the single species in this lineage is a highly specialized member not warranting generic status. Evidence from the molecular phylogenetic investigations highlights the evolutionary diversification and biogeographic context of this plant group, and suggests additional taxonomic investigations of both Musa and Ensete are in order.
27757048|Salix is a taxonomically difficult genus and its generic and its generic limits and infrageneric division are still highly controversial. We employed sequences of the chloroplast rbcL gene, trnD-T spacer and atpB-rbcL spacer for phylogenetic analyses of Salix. The results strongly support that Salix, Toisusu and Chosenia from a monophyletic group, confirming the merge of Toisusu and Chosenia with Salix. Within Salix s.1., two major clades are recognizable; one contains species of subgenus Salix (excluding sections Triandrae and Urbanianae), with the New World and the Old World species forming strongly supported clades, respectively; and the other includes sections Triandrae, Urbanianae, Chosenia and all species of subgenera Chamaetia and Vetrix, with the latter two subgenera forming a robustly supported subclade but with low resolution. A new infrageneric classification of Salix in herein proposed. The previously recognized subgenus Salix is split into three subgenera: Salix, Chosenia and Triandrae, and subgenera Chamaetia and Vetrix are combined as subgenus Vetrix.
27757049|Tidestromia (Gomphrenoideae, Amaranthaceae) is monophyletic genus restricted to deserts of North America with the highest levels of endemism centered in the Chihuahuan desert. Tidestromia is morphologically distinct from related genera which caused researchers difficulty in identifying its phylogenetic affinities. Recent molecular phylogenetic evidence suggests that a monophyletic Tidestromia is related to Alternanthera and Pedersenia in a well-supported linage referred to as the Alternantheroid clade. Preliminary species circumscription of Tidestromia suggested six species, two subspecies and two varieties. However, this study revealed problems in the current infraspecific classification based on morphology. The current study aims at testing the phylogenetic relationships within the genus using nuclear (ITS), chloroplast (rpl16, trnL-F), and morphological data and examine the role that soils, climate, and habitat have had on speciation in the genus. Earlier researchers hypothesized these environmental features were reproductive barriers driving speciation; however, incongruency between the chloroplast and nuclear datasets with additional support from previous cytogenetic data suggests that hybrid speciation has played a larger role. The total evidence results in a fully resolved ingroup and suggests that all infraspecific taxa are distinct species requiring nomenclatural taxonomic changes. Contrary to previous findings, the annual habit has evolved twice in the genus.
27757050|The eggplant (Solanum melongena L.), also known as aubergine or brinjal, has been cultivated for centuries in the Old World and is currently a crop species of global importance. Despite this, hypotheses of eggplant evolution have been fraught with controversy. Previous conclusions have relied solely on morphological characters or have been based on insufficient taxonomic sampling, leading to conflicting opinions of the number of species, phylogenetic relationships, and patterns of domestication in a group of related taxa termed the S. melongena complex. The S. melongena complex shows a series of morphological intermediates from small-fruited spiny plants to large-fruited non-spiny plants. We use DNA sequence data to show that eggplants arose in Africa and were dispersed throughout the Middle East to Asia. Solanum linnaeanum, a wild species not previously associated with eggplant evolution, is a member of the S. melongena complex. These data provide the most comprehensive evidence to date for the evolution of the cultivated eggplant.
27757051|With about 100 species, Euryops (Cass.) Cass. ranks among the most speciose genera of the tribe Senecioneae (Asteraceae). The genus has its greatest diversity in South Africa, and displays an interesting disjunct distribution with most of the taxa found in southern Africa and a group of eight endemic species confined to the mountains of tropical East Africa and northeastern Africa. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence data from three chloroplast fragments and the nuclear ITS region were used to reconstruct the evolutionary history of 41 Euryops species in order to unravel species relationships and to determine the origin of the disjunct Afromontane taxa. Our results show a lack of support and resolution in the internal structure of the trees, but also reveal strong incongruence between the ITS and cpDNA datasets as assessed by Bayes Factors. We hypothesise that this is a consequence of the isolation and divergence of many populations over a short time period at some point in the history of the genus. Molecular dating based on our phylogenetic tree suggests that the genus diversified in South Africa around four million years ago. The origin of the East African species, dated at 1.9 Ma, well after the uplift of the East African mountains, is consistent with a scenario of a single dispersal event from South Africa northwards into the tropical East African mountains where diversification occurred, creating a monophyletic group of regional Afromontane endemics.
27757052|A robust phylogeny for the genus Hyacinthoides (bluebells) was established using cpDNA sequences and evaluated in light of a re-assessment of morphological diversity, cytology, distribution patterns and field observations. The genus is distributed in the western MediterraneanAtlantic region and the northern African mountains. Within this area, there is a major divide between an eastern and western clade, each of them with their own radiations, mainly in autumn-winter flowering taxa in northern Africa and spring flowering taxa in the Iberian Peninsula. We now recognise eleven taxa and one hybrid taxon, which are separated into five clades. Polyploidy is confined to the H. non-scriptahispanica clade with diploid and triploid taxa as well as a newly recognized tetraploid taxon. For the eleven taxa, distribution ranges, taxonomy, morphology, descriptions and a new key are presented. The nomenclatural history of the genus has been reviewed. Generitypes have been designated for Hyacinthoides Heist. ex Fabr. and Endymion Dumort. and lectotypes selected for four species, three of which are combined for the first time in Hyacinthoides: H. cedretorum, H. ciliolata and H. flahaultiana. Several important questions worthy of further investigation, such as evolutionary processes and their major drivers, e.g. environmental change in the Mediterranean basin, flower morphology and associated pollinators, or sympatric versus allopatric speciation have come into sharper focus through this phylogenetic investigation.
27757053|Warneckea consists of shrubs and small trees endemic to tropical forests in Africa, Madagascar, and Mauritius. Phylogenetic analyses of sequence data from the transcribed spacers of nuclear ribosomal DNA (ETS, ITS) indicate that W. sect. Carnosa Jacq.-Fl. (1 sp., East Africa and Madagascar) is a divergent element that is best treated at subgeneric level. The analyses recovered three major lineages in W. subg. Warneckea, together forming a basal trichotomy. The three lineages represent W. sect. Strychnoidea (western and central Africa), sect. Warneckea (East Africa, Madagascar, Mauritius), and a third group with three West African species (W. fascicularis, W. guineensis, W. mangrovensis) comprising the newly proposed W. sect. Guineensea.
27757054|Meteoriella S. Okamura, an endemic moss genus of eastern Asia, has traditionally been classified in Pterobryaceae or Meteoriaceae. However, recent molecular data has suggested that Meteoriella should be placed in Hylocomiaceae. To elucidate the systematic position of Meteoriella within Hypnales, we analyzed two DNA sequence datasets consisting of two regions (mt-nad5, cp-rps4) with 64 taxa, and five regions (mt-nad5, cp-rps4, cp-rbcL, cp-trnL-F, nr-ITS2) with 27 taxa, using maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods. Analyses of the two datasets strongly supported Meteoriella as sister to Loeskeobryum, which has hitherto been included in the Hylocomiaceae. Although the evolution of Hypnales and the monophyly of Hylocomiaceae remain unresolved, a close relationship between Meteoriella and Hylocomiaceae is clear. Meteoriella shares some morphological characters with Meteoriaceae and Pterobryaceae, apparently owing to convergent evolution related to epiphytic growth. A reappraisal of morphological evidence reveals greater morphological similarity with Hylocomiaceae than previously recognized. The possible systematic position of Meteoriella within Hylocomiaceae is discussed. Loeskeobryum, rather than Orontobryum (suggested by earlier studies), shows the closest phylogenetic relationship with Meteoriella.
27757055|Mallotus s.str. is a monophyletic, large, palaeotropical genus in the family Euphorbiaceae. We investigated the phylogeny of the genus in order to (1) determine the evolutionary relationships within the Mallotus s.str. clade; (2) assess whether the six sections as circumscribed in the traditional classification reflect clades and evaluate the characters used in the classification; and (3) determine what are additional new clades and their supporting morphological characters. For this purpose we assembled different datasets: plastid (matK) and nuclear (gpd) DNA sequences, macromorphological features and leaf anatomical data. We found that Mallotus sect. Mallotus, sect. Polyadenii and sect. Stylanthus are monophyletic, M. sect. Axenfeldia and sect. Rottleropsis are polyphyletic, and M. sect. Philippinenses is paraphyletic. Six additional clades with morphological synapomorphies were also identified. An analysis of quantitative morphological data, in combination with qualitative morphological and molecular datasets resulted in almost completely resolved phylogenies and increased support values. However, the higher-level relationships between the clades are not supported in our analyses and the position of many taxa is still ambiguous.
27757056|Tribe Schismatoglottideae comprises one large genus, Schismatoglottis, and six small 'satellite' genera. A combined molecular phylogenetic analysis of matK, the 3 portion of the trnK intron, and trnL-F sequence data was carried out on 77 taxa representing all genera in the tribe, all informal groups in Schismatoglottis, together with sister tribe Cryptocoryneae, and outgroups from Araceae. Analyses of combined datasets with parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods revealed tribe Schismatoglottideae to be a polyphyletic assemblage. Neotropical Schismatoglottis is shown to be sister to the palaeotropical Schismatoglottideae + Cryptocoryneae. Schismatoglottis acuminatissima is a sister clade to the rest of the Schismatoglottideae. Palaeotropical Schismatoglottis is unsupported as a monophyletic genus. A new neotropical tribe of Araceae, Philonotieae S.Y. Wong & P.C. Boyce, sister to Cryptocoryneae + palaeotropical Schismatoglottideae, is proposed.
27757057|The genus Clerodendrum s.1. is polyphyletic. Although recent studies have resulted in C. subg. Cyclonema and C. sect. Konocalyx being removed to the resurrected genus Rotheca, and the unispecific genus Huxleya being sunk into Clerodendrum, it has been unclear whether Clerodendrum as currently circumscribed is monophyletic, particularly in relation to the American genera Aegiphila, Amasonia, and Tetraclea. This phylogenetic study employs four relatively fast-evolving chloroplast DNA regions, trnT-L, trnL-F, trnD-T, and trnS-fM, to clarify the generic boundaries of Clerodendrum and its relationship to allied genera. The results corroborate previous studies that there are three well-supported clades in the currently recognized Clerodendrum: an Asian clade, an African clade, and a Pantropical Coastal clade. The Asian clade and African clade are sister groups and together form a monophyletic group. However, the Pantropical Costal clade is more closely related to the three American genera than it is to the other two Clerodendrum clades. In addition, a Caribbean species, C. spinosum, is found to be more closely related to the American genera than it is to any of the three major Clerodendrum groups. These results indicate that Clerodendrum as currently circumscribed is not monophyletic. We propose to separate the Pantropical Coastal clade and C. spinosum by reviving the genera Volkameria (including Hyxleya) and Ovieda, respectively for these, and to restrict Clerodendrum to the Asian and African clades. Brief descriptions of the genera to be recognized are provided. All Neotropical 'Clerodendrum' taxa are referred to other genera, necessitating six new combinations, which are also provided, where required, for two other well-studied Old World Volkameria species; all names ever used in Ovieda are given their modern placings (two placed newly in synonymy). The study also sheds light on the evolution of an intriguing breeding strategy that avoids self-pollination or/and sexual interference. This strategy involves presentation of pollen and stigma in the centre of the flower in a sequential fashion by moving the filaments and style. It appears to have evolved in the common ancestor of Clerodendrum, Volkameria, Ovieda, Amasonia, Tetraclea, Aegiphila and Kalaharia, and still occurs in all of these taxa except Aegiphila, where it has been succeeded by a heterostylour systems.
27757058|Hybridization plays a major role in speciation. However, hybridization and reticulate evolution in general are poorly understood in tree species because genetic documentation is often missing. Analyses of biparentally inherited gene regions allow detection of reticulate signals. Multicopy and single-copy nuclear markers may show significant intraindividual variability owing to reticulation processes. Naturally, such processes induce imcompatible phylogenetic signal resulting in incongruent genealogies. Data from three nuclear markers, two multicopy nrDNA spacers, and the single-copy 2nd intron of the LEAFY gene, mirror ancient and recent horizontal gene flow in plane trees (Platanus). In addition to previously assembled data from the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of the 35S ribosomal DNA, we found atypical 5S rDNA intergenic spacer sequences (5S-IGS) causing significant intra- and interindividual polymorphism, and a conspicuous LEAFY intron dimorphism. A detailed framework of reticulate molecular evolution of Platanus can be erected using splits graphs based on distances between cloned sequences or individuals, and competing topologies. Two hundred and sixty-one 5S-IGS sequences and LEAFY genotyping of 71 individuals via sequence analysis and PCR-RFLP support a previous ITS study (including pseudogenous and non-pseudogenous variants) suggesting that the modern North American taxa P. rzedowskii and P. occidentalis var. palmeri are the result of ancient hybridization. Platanus occidentalis var. palmeri requires taxonomic revision and is provisionally treated at species rank.
27757059|The Western Balkans, characterized by high rates of endemism, are recognized as one the most diverse and speciesrich areas of Europe. The present study focuses on diploid speciation in a poorly explored ancestral group of the genus Cardamine that is distributed in the amphi-Adriatic territory. Morphological data and DNA sequences (plastid trnL intron and trnL-trnF spacer, ITS of nrDNA, and single-copy nuclear gene CHS) were used to address taxonomic, phylogenetic and evolutionary questions. Recognition of several previously described, but recently not accepted narrow endemics is supported (C. fialae, C. rupestrics, C. serbica). Cardamine maritima s.str. is segregated into three distinct entities, which were given species rank. A new taxonomic concept of the group is proposed, including identification key, synonymy, typifications, C. montenegrina sp. nov. and C. adriatica nom. nov. Chloroplast data indicate radiation of the ancestral lineage into a series of distinct endemic species; lack of resolution an internal nodes and incongruence with nuclear phylogenies suggest that this radiation occured rapidly. Nuclear data indicate more recent hybridization events. It is assumed that glacial-induced local-scale and altitudinal migrations along the Balkan coastline and an adjacent massifs caused contracts between previously isolated populations, resulting in occassional interspecific gene-flow. Trans-Adriatic contacts and gene exchange are also suggested.
27757060|The main purpose of this study was to clarify the speciation and taxonomic status of European representatives of Lilium sect. Liriotyous (Lilium albanicum, L. pyrenaicum) based on karyotype differentiation. Clear interspecific differentiation was revealed among karyotypes of these taxa using fluorochrome (chromomycin and DAPI) bandings, fluorescent in situ hybridization and silver staining. Differences were evident in the number of position of CMA and DAPI bands and in the number, position and activity of 18S26S and 5S rDNA genes. It is hypothesized that the type species of Lilium sect. Liriotypus, L. candidum, represents the ancestral species from which three evolutionary directions diverged: the first towards L. chalcedonicum, the second towards L. rhodopaeum, and the third towards L. albanicum. The radiation process expanded from L. albanicum, beyond the southeast to the central Dinaric Alps where L. Bosniacum is strongly represented. Furthermore, L. carniolicum evolved from northwestern populations of L. bosniacum. According to this evolutionary hypothesis, L. pomponium and L. pyrenaicum would be the youngest species.
27757061|A revised classification of the liverwort genus Leptoscyphus (Lophocoleaceae) is presented on the basis of previous phylogenetic analyses as well as morphological examination of recent plant material and type specimens. The three subgenera that have traditionally been recognized based on morphological grounds, namely Leptoscyphus subg. Anomylia, L. subg. Physoscyphus, and L. subg. Leptoscyphus, are well retrieved by the phylogeny. Two new subgenera, L. subg. spinoscyphus and L. subg. Australoleptoscyphus, are created for L. cleefi and L. spectabilis and the southern South Hemisphere species, respectively. Three new species, namely L. gradsteinii, L. lambinomii, and L. sotiauxii, are described here based on molecular and morphological evidence. The new combination L. porphyrius subsp. azoricus is made. Lectotypes are designated for Chiloscyphus australis, C. huidobroanus, Jungermannia amphibolia, J. pallidovirens, J. physocalyx, Lophocolea belmorana, L. diversifolia, L. excipulata, and Mylia azorica.
27757062|The small Southwest Asian scree plant genus Heldreichia Boiss. (Brassicaceae) with its diversity centre in Anatolia, is revised in a morphological and molecular (ITS sequence) monograph. Heldreichia taxa under study appear to be monophyletic in the Bayesian tree; the tribal position remains unclear. A re-evaluation of morphological characters resulted in a new taxonomic concept of Heldreichia. We suggest only one single polymorphic species, H. bupleurifolia, with four largely geovicarious subspecies, including a new subspecies, H. bupleurifolia subsp. polymorpha, for the westernmost populations of the Taurus range. Geographical areas with higher morphological and molecular diversity correspond to the generally accepted speciation and diversity centres of the Taurus range. Inter-pluvial migration events between isolated mountain ranges may have contributed to the morphological and genetic diversity within Heldreichia. Populations with non-entire leaf margins, traditionally named H. rotundifolia, should have evolved polytopically. Keys, a distribution map and illustrations are provided for all accepted subspecific taxa. Heldreichia bupleurifolia var. subtriloba and H. kotschyi are lectotypified.
27757063|A new species of Gesneriaceae discovered in remnants of deciduous forests on limestone outcrops of Minas Gerais, Brazil, is described and compared with morphologically related taxa. This plant presents the diagnostic features of the tribe Gloxinieae, but a unique combination of morphological traits distinguishes this taxon from previously described genera. Its phylogenetic position was inferred based on analyzing DNA sequences variation of five loci: the rpl16 intron, rps16 intron, trnL-F intron-spacer, a portion of the plastid-expressed glutamine synthetase gene (ncpGS) and the ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS). Molecular phylogenetic analyses confirm the position of this new species in the Gloxinieae, as a sister lineage of a clade including the Brazilian genera Mandirola and Goyazia. However, tests using topological constraints do not reject the alternative relationship that places this taxon with Gloxiniopsis in a monophyletic group. To accomodate this species in the current generic circumscription of Gloxinieae, the new genus Chautemsia A.O. Araujo & V.C. Souza is created.
27757064|The Solanum bahamense L. species group is a small monophyletic group of spiny solanums (Solanum subg. Leptostemonum) restricted to the West Indies. The group has been variously recognised as including one to five species, and one of these (Solanum ensifolium Dunal, as S. drymophilum O.E. Schulz) is listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. We here use a combination of morphological characters and plastid sequence data to assess diversity within the group and to explore patterns of differentiation across the archipelago. We recognise three species in the group: S. polyacanthos Lam., endemic to Hispaniola, S. ensifolium Dunal, endemic to Puerto Rico, and S. bahamense L., widespread across the region from the Florida Keys to Grenada, but absent from Hispaniola. Within S. bahamense, three geographically distinct lineages can be distinguished. Maximal genetic diversity in the group occurs in the centre of the archipelago, on Hispaniola and Puerto Rico (including the Virgin Islands). A taxonomic treatment of the three species is provided, with a key, complete typification for all synonyms and exsiccatae (in an Appendix). We recognise the distinctness of S. ensifolium and our data provide support for its inclusion in the Endanged Species Act and its Red List status as critically endanged.
27757065|Traditional classifications of the suborder Portulacineae recognize six families: Basellaceae, Cactaceae, Didiereaceae, Haplophytaceae, Hectorellaceae, and Portulacaceae. However, phylogenetic analyses based on molecular sequence data indicate that the traditional family Portulacaceae is paraphyletic and consists of three distinct lineages that also include Cactaceae, Didiereaceae, and Hectorellaceae. We use sequence data from the chloroplast genes matK and ndhF representing 64 species of Portulacineae and outgroups to reconstruct their phylogenetic relationships with Bayesian and maximum parsimony inference methods. Evidence from these molecular phylogenetic analyses as well as from comparative morphological investigations allow us to propose a revised familial classification of the suborder Portulacineae. We recognize eight monophyletic families: Anacampserotaceae (Anacampseros, Grahamia, Talinopsis), Basellaceae, Cactaceae, Didiereaceae (incl. Calyptrotheca, Ceraria, Portulacaria), Halophytaceae, Montiaceae (incl. Hectorellaceae, Calandrinia, Cistanthe, Claytonia, Lewisia, Montia, Phemeranthus), Portulacaceae (Portulaca only), and Talinaceae (Amphipetalum, Talinella, Talinum). We provide a synopsis for this revised family classification with an identification key mainly based on habit and fruit characters, and family diagnoses with information on distribution, taxonomic diversity, and a brief discussion on phylogenetics and classification.
27757066|Building on two centuries of history, we advocate an expanded and maximally informative format for floral formulae to describe angiosperm flowers in formal taxonomic descriptions. Using standard typeface and Unicode character codes, the format can summarise a wide range of features, including: acropetal sequence of organ initation, number and symmetry of each whorl of floral organs (bracts, sepals, petals [or tepals), androecium, gynoecium, ovules), position of the organs relative to each other, partial and/or complete fusion of organs, resupination, organ loss and suppression, and deviations from standard bisexuality. We use several complex flowers to demonstrate our view that all known flower morphs can be accurately represented by the updated format, and show how use of floral formulae can outline some unanswered questions regarding the floral organisation of the model organsim Arabidopsis. Possible uses of floral formulae extend beyond static description of mature morphology into the comparative realm. When combined with phylogenies, they help to elucidate generalised groundplans, plesiomorphic architecture, and the location and polarity of particular character-state transitions. They can usefully be applied within as well as between species, to compare wildtype versus mutant morphs and diferent ontogenetic stages. Perhaps their greatest strenghts are that they (1) require only a universally available typescript, and (2) bring a comprehensive uniformity to the description of flowers, acting as a checklist of features to be examined. We recommend that floral formulae become a routine component of diagnoses in protologues and other formal taxonomic (re)descriptions, functioning as a logical phenotypic counterpart to the DNA barcode.
27757067|DNA barcoding has the possibility for application in many fiels, ranging from biological inventory and species discovery to forensics and quality control. Barcoding could have great utility within the aquatic angiosperm family Podostemaceae, as these plants can be extremely difficult to identify on the basis of morphological characters alone, but are important components of tropical rivers and face threats from increased water pollution. Several potential barcodes for land plants have been suggested, including two 3-locus combinations proposed by the Plant Working Group of the Consortium for the Barcode of Life. These loci, matK, rpoB, rpoCl, and trnH-psbA, were tested for their potential utility in African members of the Podostemacease. Our results show that although the rpoCl region performs best in terms of universality of amplification and sequencing, the superior resolving power of matK makes it the most promising of the regions for use in barcoding. In the light of these results, we discuss the potential to apply barcoding to Podostemaceae of Africa and make suggestions for the directions of future work to exploit the full potential of this new technology in this group of plants.
27757068|The provisions in the Code for naming plant fossil taxa have changed subsantially over the years. The history of these changes reflects the tension between palaeobotanists (including palynologists studying plant microfossils) who need a flexible set of regulations, and the tendency for the Code to include nomenclatural regulations that constrain taxonomic decisions. The current Vienna Code now provides for plant fossils to be named as fossil taxa, which is a flexible taxonomic concept that should suit the needs of most palaeobotanists. However, the Vienna Code also incorporates the more restrictive concept of morphotaxa and most palaeobotanists seem ot be under the misapprehension that plant fossisl can only be named as morphotaxa. In our view, the concept of morphotaxa is logically flawed and unnecessary in practice, and should be removed from the Code.
27757069|The existence of the type material indicated in the protologues of all Indian curcuma species names is confirmed or excluded following visits to numerous herbaria. Lectotypes, neotypes and epitypes are designated for previously untypified names o rnames for which the holotype is missing. Earlier ineffective or superfluous typifications are discussed, several new synonyms are recognised and notes on critical taxa are provided.
27757070|The proposal by Redhead & al. in Taxon 55: 10291030 (2006) to conserve Boletus applanatus against B. lipsiensis comes anomalously late after acceptance of the name Ganoderma lipsiense as correct for what had been known as G. applanatum s.str. This name was abandoned by careful taxonomists without regret for it has been used in such a variable way that it was, and remains, a permanent source of confusion. The arguments for retaining the presently correct, unambiguous G. lipsiense are presented.
27757071|A mislabelled specimen in the Cliford herbarium (BM) is identified as the single extant original element on which Linnaeus based Smilax lanceolata. It is here designated as the lectotype of the name, corroborating its placement in the synonymy of S. laurifolia L.
27757072|Xylosma congesta (Lour.) Merr. is the correct name for a species for which two additional names are in common use: Xylosma japonica A. Gray and X. racemosa (Siebold & Zucc.) Miq. This paper aims to stabilize the name of the species.
27757073|The following names are recommended for conservation: Pseudocercospora against Stigmina and Phaeoisariopsis; Boletus applanatus against B. lipsiensis; Lyophyllum with L. semitale as conserved type; Roccellina against roccellaria; Psilocybe with P. semilanceata as conserved type; Calvatia nom. cons. against Lanopilal and Phaeographis against Creographa, ectographis, Flegographa, Hymenodecton, Platygramma, and Pyrographa and with P. dendritica as conserved type. As a result of reference under Art. 32.4, the Committee recommends that the descriptive statement accompanying publication fo Ascomycota Cavalier-Smith be considered adequate for valid publication but recommends that that for Blatocladiomycota Doweld should not.
25677595|Phylogenetic relationships among species of Quercus (oaks) from western Eurasia including the western part of the Himalayas are examined for the first time. Based on ITS and 5S-IGS data three major infrageneric groups are recognized for western Eurasia: the cerroid, iliciod, and roburoid oaks. While individuals of the cerroid and ilicoid groups cluster according to their species, particularly in the 5S-IGS analyses, individuals of species of roburoid oaks do not cluster with exception of Quercus pontica. The Cypriot endemic Quercus alnifolia belongs to the ilicoid oaks, in contrast to traditional views placing it within the cerroid oaks. Based on all ITS data avilable, the groups identified for western Eurasia can be integrated into a global infrageneric framework for Quercus. The Ilex group is resurrected as a well-defined group that comprises taxa traditionally placed into six subsections of Q. sects. Cerris and Lepidobalanus (white oaks) sensu Camus. Phylogenetic reconstructions suggest two major lineages within Quercus, each consisting of three infrageneric groups. Within the first lineage, the Quercus group (roburoid oaks in western Eurasia) and the Lobatae group evolved by "budding" as is reflected by incomplete lineage sorting, high variability within groups, and low differentiation among groups. The groups of the second lineage, including the Cyclobalanopsis, Cerris (cerroid oaks in western Eurasia), and Ilex (ilicoid oaks in western Eurasia) groups, evolved in a more tree-like fashion.
25677596|The genus Carlina, with its 28 currently accepted species, ranks among the most thoroughly studied plant genera in Europe. Previous evolutionary hypotheses rested on a priori assumptions of character change, but for this study, DNA sequence data from nuclear ETS and three chloroplast regions obtained from all but one species of Carlina were used to produce a phylogenetic hypothesis. The results reveal that early branching lineages were morphologically divergent and that growth form shifts occurred more often and in different directions than previously thought, rendering a reconstruction of character states for the common ancestor of Carlina difficult to achieve. Nonetheless, results indicate that treelets were not plesiomorphic and that they most likely evolved in parallel in two island lineages growing in Macaronesia and in the Aegean. In addition, an independent evolution of two annual species in Carlina was revealed and most of the 50 morphological, biochemical, and karyological characters plotted on the tree proved to be homoplasic. Twenty-three anatomical characters from the stem-base/hypocotyl region provided no clear evidence for secondary woodiness and only the length of libriform fibers was clearly associated with plant height, but not without exceptions.
25677597|The Eriocaulaceae are easily recognized because of the small unisexual flowers in long-pedunculate heads and spiraperturate pollen grains. Their monophyly has never been disputed but internal relationships within the family have not been broadly explored and genera are typically distinguished by few floral characters. Here, we present the first comprehensive phylogenetic study of Eriocaulaceae based on individual and combined molecular datasets, including the plastid psbA-trnH and trnL-F and the nuclear ITS. Results are largely congruent among DNA regions and support the internal dichotomy between the two subfamilies: Eriocauloideae and Paepalanthoideae. Eriocaulon and Leiothrix are strongly supported as monophyletic, whereas Paepalanthus, Blastocaulon, and Syngonanthus are not monophyletic. The phylogenetic nature of Actinocephalus is not resolved and Lachnocaulon, Mesanthemum, Philodice, Rondonanthus, and Tonina (monospecific) are represented in our analyses by a single species each. Based on our results, we suggest two principal generic realignments in the family. The first is the division of Syngonanthus in two genera: Syngonanthus s.str., including Philodice (conserving the former name against the latter), and Comanthera, which is being reinstated to include two sections segregated from Syngonanthus: S. sect. Eulepis and S. sect. Thysanocephalus. The second realignment suggested is the amalgamation of Actinocephalus, Blastocaulon, Lachnocaulon, and Tonina into Paepalanthus s.l. Three 'stat. nov.' within Paepalanthus are published (P. ser. Leptocephali, P. ser. Rosulati, and P. ser. Dimeri).
25677598|The pantropical orchid genus Polystachya is the subject of ongoing taxonomic work. We inferred phylogenetic relationships in the genus using 5.3 kb of plastid DNA, for 83 out of ca. 240 species and 12 out of 15 sections, as well as five outgroup species. We also collected ploidy data using chromosome counts and genome size estimates. Bayesian and parsimony trees were congruent with each other and well resolved. Polystachya appears monophyletic based on current sampling, provided that the name P. neobenthamia is used instead of Neobenthamia gracilis for that species. The current sectional classification does not define monophyletic groups, but the present study can be used as the basis for a future sectional classification. Areas postulated as Pleistocene refugia for wet tropical forests in Africa also form centres of diversity for the genus. Biogeographical analyses using DIVA and Lagrange show an early radiation in eastern Africa, followed by separate radiations in eastern and western Africa. Subsequent dispersal from western to eastern Africa has occurred at a much higher rate than from east to west. Dispersal to the Neotropics occurred more than once, and one lineage has spread recently and rapidly throughout the tropics. Polyploidy has occurred several times during the diversification of the genus, most notably in association with the recent pantropical dispersal.
25677599|For centuries the wonderful looking, but foul smelling, Arum lilies have fascinated botanists. The floral odour of many species is believed to mimic faecesthe oviposition substrate of their pollinators, mainly coprophilous flies and beetles. But not all of the 29 Arum species produce a bad floral smell. The genus has evolved a variety of pollination mechanisms, including sweet and wine-like odours, and maybe even pheromone mimicry. In order to study the evolution of the pollination syndromes in Arum, a detailed and reliable phylogeny is a crucial basis. Here we present the first detailed molecular phylogeny of the genus Arum. By combining three chloroplast and one nuclear loci, as well as AFLPs, a highly resolved tree with good statistical support was obtained. The phylogeny is in most parts in congruence with the traditional classification of the genus. By comparing the phylogeny with the data on the pollination biology of the genus we could show that the mimicry of faeces is the oldest and most basal pollination mechanism, but is also present in the youngest and most derived species. The phylogeny presented here will help to study the evolution of deceptive pollination mechanisms in Arum.
25677600|The tropical clade of Orobanchaceae contains approximately forty genera, typically with fewer than ten species each, and contributes significantly to the variation in floral morphology found within the family. Despite the economic importance of this clade, which contains three of four most important genera of crop parasites within the family, it has been under-sampled in previous phylogenies. We tested the monophyly of the tropical clade and its major genera using DNA sequences from the nuclear (internal transcribed spacer) and plastid (rpl16, trnT-L) genomes. The tropical clade was strongly supported as monophyletic in all analyses, and four main clades were recovered. The earliest diverging lineage from the remainder of the tropical clade is comprised of the shrubby genera Asepalum and Cyclocheilon, previously placed within Cyclocheilaceae. The atypical holoparasitic Alectra alba was shown to belong within the primarily holoparasitic Harveya, and the hemiparasitic Harveya obtusifolia was shown to belong to an otherwise holoparasitic lineage within Harveya. Both New World Melasma species were included here for the first time, and these were shown to be more closely related to the Neotropical hemiparasitic Escobedia than the African Melasma lineage. These results support a previous study recognizing Nesogenes within the tropical clade of Orobanchaceae rather than the separate family Nesogenaceae.
25677601|We used the genus Smelowskia, which is distributed in Asia and North America and comprises both diploids and polyploids, as an example to address phylogeny, biogeography and polyploidization in the recently (ca. 3 million years ago) formed arctic biome with particular reference to the Beringian area. We combined data from high-resolution nuclear markers (seven SSR loci) with sequences from two nuclear regions (the low copy RPA2 region and the multicopy nrITS region) and five plastid regions (trnLUAA and rps16 introns, trnHGUG-psbA, trnLUAA-trnFGAA, and 5'prs12-rp120 spacers). The different nuclear markers showed a congruent pattern that fits well with that observed in morphology and geography, while the plastid data showed some incongruence. Both sequence and SSR data support merging of Smelowskia porsildii, S. spathulatifolia, and S. jurtzevii into a single species (S. porsildii). An Asian origin of the Beringian taxa was inferred, resulting in two separate lineages of American-Beringian/American taxa. The SSR data confirmed polyploidy in several species, supporting the major role of this process in the evolution of the arctic flora.
25677602|With in excess of 70 species, the Southeast Asian/Australian genus Typhonium is the largest genus of the Areae, a tribe that includes up to nine smaller genera of which Sauromatum and Lazarum have recently been reduced to the synonymy of Typhonium. To test the circumscription and relationships of Typhonium to the other Areae, we used chloroplast and nuclear DNA sequences (4319 aligned nucleotides) for 86 of the total 153 species, including representatives of all relevant genera. In the resulting phylogeny, Typhonium species fall into three well-supported clades: the first comprises most Typhonium species, including the type, T. trilobatum; the second consists of the type of Sauromatum, S. guttatum, and other species formerly placed in that genus; the third includes only Australian endemics. Each of the remaining six genera of Areae is monophyletic. Sauromatum and Typhonium are not sister groups, requiring the recognition of Sauromatum. The Australian clade also needs to be ranked as a genus to achieve similar levels of morphological, geographic, and genetic distinctness among the genera of Areae. However, since only 10 of the 16 described Australian endemics currently placed in Typhonium have so far been sequenced, not including the type of the name of the Australian genus Lazarum, we refrain from applying this name to the Australian clade. Among the nomenclatural and taxonomic results of this study are a key to the nine species of Sauromatum, and five new combinations. We also report two new chromosome counts and discuss the implications of the molecular phylogeny for the evolution of Sauromatum karyotypes.
25677603|Phylogenetic analyses of liverworts using chloroplast rbcL and rps4 sequences were performed with special reference to the enigmatic thalloid liverwort, Mizutania riccardioides. The results showed that Mizutania is nested within leafy liverwort family Calypogeiaceae (subclass Jungermanniidae), thereby refuting the traditional interpretation that Mizutania is a member of the simple thalloid liverworts (subclass Metzgeriidae) related to Aneuraceae. Male plants with three ranked bracts, which are newly discovered in this study, also show a close morphological affinity to those of leafy liverworts. Parallel evolution of the flattened gametophyte seems to have occurred sporadically in the Jungermanniidae in association with adaptation to prostrate growth on the ground or on living leaves. The unistratose thalloid features of Mizutania are interpreted as an extremely reduced or highly specialized form of a creeping leafy liverwort. The rudimentary sexual branches which develop on the margins of the thallus are similar in many characteristics to those of Calypogeiaceae. We reduce the monotypic family Mizutaniaceae to a synonym of Calypogeiaceae.
25677604|We present a phylogenetic analysis of the moss genus Daltonia based on nucleotide sequences from three plastid loci (psbT, trnL, trnG) plus the nuclear ribosomal RNA genes (ITS), including 9 of 21 species in this genus. Of the nine species, seven are well-supported as monophyletic, even when multiple accessions came from different continents. Early diverging species in the genus have relatively restricted ranges that are limited to a single continent, whereas most or all later-diverging species have broad intercontinental distributions. The observation that intercontinental distributions are repeated in multiple monophyletic species suggests that a key innovation underlying enhanced abilities for long dispersal evolved within Daltonia, and that this potential was inherited among derived species from their common ancestor. The nature of this (these) innovation(s) remains obscure, but may be related to both relaxation of ecological limitations on establishment, and to effective dispersal of spores per se.
25677605|Reseda sect. Glaucoreseda is a monophyletic group composed of five endemic tetraploid species with a disjunct distribution in the high mountains and plateaus of the Iberian Peninsula and Morocco. It was previously suggested that range shifts induced by Quaternary glaciations played an important role in the speciation of the group. We studied the evolution of R. sect. Glaucoreseda in order to infer historical range dynamics and speciation processes, and to understand current distributional patterns. Phylogeographic analyses were performed using nuclear ribosomal ITS and plastid trnL-F and rps16 sequences. Cloning of additive ITS sequences was carried out to elucidate the origin of intra-individual polymorphisms. A dated phylogeny based on ITS and cpDNA (rbcL, matK, trnL-F) sequences was used to estimate divergence times of R. sect. Glaucoreseda. Time estimates using Penalized Likelihood analyses indicate a late Pleistocene diversification of R. sect. Glaucoreseda. Incomplete lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphisms due to recent divergence, rather than rampant hybridisation, is suggested as the main cause of the phylogenetic incongruence detected between nuclear and plastid datasets. Our results support the vicariance hypothesis for population disjunctions in the Iberian Peninsula, in which an ancestral, widespread species could have undergone differentiation by Quaternary interglacial fragmentation. In contrast, long-distance dispersal across the Strait of Gibraltar may have been involved in the colonisation of North African plateaus by R. battandieri.
25677606|White water-lilies (Nymphaea) provide an excellent model for studying evolutionary diversification in a discontinuous habitat system, which has experienced dramatic differences in connectivity during different climatic periods. Here we explore cytogenetic and molecular variation and phylogenetic relationships in the Eurasian clade of this genus based on relative nuclear DNA contents, AFLP fingerprints, and nuclear (ITS) and cpDNA sequences. In line with some recent taxonomic treatments, our results support that the Eurasian clade consists of three species. We show that the Eurosiberian N. candida is an allopolyploid that originated at least twice by hybridization in the wide overlap zone between the mainly European N. alba lineage and the mainly Asian N. tetragona lineage. The N. alba lineage served as the chloroplast donor except for the Karelian N. candida, but the ITS region of the allopolyploid was homogenized in the direction of N. alba in all cases. The southern, widespread lineage of N. candida probably originated first, whereas the northwestern lineage, restricted to a small, previously glaciated area in Karelia, may have originated as late as in the current interglacial. We observed only low levels of DNA sequence variation within N. alba and N. tetragona, indicating rapid range expansions possibly preceeded by strong bottlenecks in glacial refugia. Our results suggest that populations of freshwater organisms found now in disjunct aquatic habitats across Eurasia were connected during previous climatic periods. These connections promoted rapid expansions of divergent lineages and repeated formation of evolutionary novelty via hybridization and polyploidization.
25677607|Gingko biloba L. is one of the most mysterious plant species, which continues to attract the interest of scientists and the public since many centuries. However, our knowledge of its evolutionary history and worldwide distribution is limited. Herein we are combining evidence from a previous phylogeographic analysis of Ginkgo biloba's range in China using cpDNA and AFLPs with new data from old, early introduced in Korea, Japan, Europe and Northern America with the aim to unravel the early human-mediated introduction history of this species. We provide evidence that Ginkgo biloba reached Japan via different routes from China during the last two millennia most likely by human-mediated dispersal. Based on AFLP data, all individuals originally introduced to Europe and North America (e.g., by Kaempfer in Europe in the 1720s) are genetically similar to one of the Korean accessions raising, the question of the validity of the origin of Kaempfer's original material, which was said to be brought from Japan to Europe in the early 18th century. Multiple introduction into Korea and Japan in concert with an out-crossing mating system has maintained high levels of gene diversity; this is also true for the European and North American trees. In addition, the trees outside the original Chinese Pleistocene refugia, due to their relatively small gene-pool, have a reduced number of AFLP fragments and no exclusive alleles.
25677608|In order to elucidate the biotic diversification of Asteraceae inhabiting the South American Transition Zone, we undertook a panbiogeographic analysis (based on a parsimony analysis of endemicity) and a cladistic biogeographic analysis. The study units were the six biogeographic provinces of this zone plus the seven subregions of the Neotropical and Andean regions, considered as "outgroups". Species analyzed belonged to the genera Arnaldoa, Barnadesia, Belloa, Berroa, Chevreulia, Chuquiraga, Cuatrecasiella, Dasyphyllum, Doniophyton, Duseniella, Facellis, Fulcaldea, Gamochaetopsis, Huarpea, Hypochaeris, Jalcophila, Lucilia, Luciliocline, and Schlechtendalia. A parsimony analysis of endemicity, based on presence/absence data of the 66 individual tracks ranged on two or more areas, allowed to identify four generalized tracks: (1) Coastal Peruvian Desert and Puna provinces; (2) Central Chilean, Patagonian, and Subantarctic subregions; (3) Amazonian, Chacoan, and Parana subregions; and (4) Puna province and Parana and Chacoan subregions. The Puna and Parana provinces, connected with two different generalized tracks each, constitute nodes. A cladistic biogeographic analysis, based on the paralogy-free subtrees extracted from the taxonomic area cladograms of Barnadesia, Chuquiraga, Dasyphyllum, Hypochaeris, and the Lucilia group, allowed obtaining a general area cladogram, which indicates a basic separation between the Atacama, Monte, and Prepuna provinces closely related to the Andean region, and the North Andean Paramo, Coastal Peruvian Desert, and Puna provinces closely related to the Neotropical region. Our results corroborate once again the transitional character of the provinces assigned to the South American Transition Zone, and allow speculating on their close affinities with the Andean and Neotropical regions.
25677609|The bordered pit structure in tracheary elements of 105 Boraginaceae species is studied using scanning electron microscopy to examine the systematic distribution of vestured pits. Forty-three species out of 16 genera show a uniform presence of this feature throughout their secondary xylem. Most vestures are small, unbranched and associated with the outer pit aperture of bordered intervessel pits. The feature is likely to have originated independently in the distantly related subfamilies Boraginoideae (tribe Lithospermeae) and Ehretioideae. The distribution of vestures in Ehretia agrees with recent molecular phylogenies: (1) species with vestured pits characterise the Ehretia I group (incl. Rotula), and (2) species with non-vestured pits belong to the Ehretia II group (incl. Carmona). The occurrence of vestured pits in Hydrolea provides additional support for excluding this genus from Hydrophylloideae, since Hydrolea is the only species of this subfamily with vestured pits. Functional advantages of vestured pits promoting parallel evolution of this conservative feature are suggested. The hydraulic benefits of poorly developed vestures remain underinvestigated.
25677610|The noeggerathialean fossil names Yuania H.C. Sze and Russellites Mamay are shown to be synonymous, with the latter being the junior synonym of the former. Examination and re-illustration of the type material of both Yuania and Russellites shows that they are indistinguishable taxonomically. Both sets of material have pinnules with clasping bases and concave apices in which the veins converge but do not anastomose. Sze's original description of Yuania was incorrect in indicating that the leaves were petiolate and that the veins converged. Yuania may be the first plant taxon identified in the Permian floras of China and North America with vegetative and reproductive organs represented on both continents.
25677611|In an effort to clarify the patterns of chromosome evolution in Ophrys sect. Pseudophrys (Orchidaceae), chromosome counts were made of 18 O. sect. Pseudophrys taxa from the central-western Mediterranean Basin (Iberian Peninsula and North Africa). The present results provide, for the first time, the chromosome numbers of O. algarvensis, O. arnoldii, O. bilunulata and O. dianica; four other taxa (O. atlantica, O. lupercalis, O. fusca, O. sicula) yielded chromosome numbers not previously reported for the Iberian Peninsula. The results support the idea that the basic plesiomorphic number of Ophrys is x = 18, with 2n = 36 in most species. About 40% of the specimens were polyploids. Karyomorphological data do not support classification of the investigated species into groups. However, the data reveal some geographical differentiation and suggest a possible direction of chromosomal evolution in Ophrys sect. Pseudophrys.
25677612|We present here a revised classification of Santalales, an angiosperm order that contains 18 families, 160 genera, and over 2200 species. Both nonparasitic and parasitic flowering plants occur in the traditionally circumscribed family Olacaceae whereas all other families are composed entirely of parasites. The five evolutionary radiations of aerial parasitism produced mistletoes that constitute most of the generic and specific diversity seen in the order. This classification, although based primarily upon results from molecular phylogenetic investigations, brings together all currently available information that contributes to our understanding of relationships among these plants. Monophyletic groups (clades) obtained from molecular analyses were named using a Linnaean ranked system. Four new families are named that formerly resided in Santalaceae s.l.: Amphorogynaceae, Cervantesiaceae, Comandraceae, and Nanodeaceae. A new tribal and subtribal classification for Loranthaceae is presented where nine new subtribe names are proposed.
25677613|A new Potamogeton hybrid resulting from crossing between P. nodosus and P. perfoliatus, and occurring in Europe and Africa is described here as P. assidens. The hybrid identity was unequivocally confirmed by molecular study of ITS and selected chloroplast DNA regions. In European populations, for which the maternal taxon was identified based on cpDNA as P. nodosus, maternally driven expression of characters may account to a large degree for shaping the range of morphological variability of the hybrid taxon. This was accompanied by a matroclinal concerted evolution observed at the molecular level in the ITS sequences. Our observations may suggest the presence of some genetic mechanisms that promote a higher impact of the maternal lineage on the expression and evolution of the hybrid variability both at the molecular (direction of concerted evolution in hybrids) and the morphological level. Distinctive characters of P. assidens and other morphologically close Potamogeton hybrids are discussed. The hybrid most similar to P. assidens, namely P. rectifolius, is typified.
25677614|Phylogenetic analyses of the cpDNA trnQ-trnK 5' exon region for 27 genera and 42 species of Saniculoideae and early diverging lineages of Apioideae were carried out to assess or confirm the tribal placements of the following anomalous genera: Annesorhiza, Astydamia, Chamarea, Choritaenia, Ezosciadium, Itasina, Lichtensteinia, Marlothiella, Molopospermum and Phlyctidocarpa. To accommodate these unique early diverging members of the Apiaceae and to reflect their relationships, a new tribal classification system has become necessary. Many of the early diverging genera (herein referred to as the protoapioids) can readily be distinguished from the euapioids (the remaining apioids) by the presence of scattered druse crystals in the mesocarp. The major morphological discontinuity within the family, however, lies between the combined protoapioids and euapioids (representing an expanded Apioideae s.l., including the Saniculoideae) and the subfamilies Azorelloideae and Mackinlayoideae. The broadened subfamily Apioideae is diagnostically different from the other subfamilies in the absence of rhomboidal crystals, the presence of druse crystals scattered throughout the mesocarp (subsequently lost in the euapioids), and the non-woody endocarp. No such diagnostic characters are available to support the traditional or recently expanded concept of Saniculoideae. The broadened concept of Apioideae is also supported by the sporadic presence of true wings. This character can be variously interpreted from a phylogenetic point of view, but nevertheless has considerable diagnostic value. A new tribal classification system for the protoapioids is proposed on the basis of molecular, morphological and anatomical evidence. This new system is intended to be practical and non-hierarchical to allow for future realignments amongst the tribes, as more evidence becomes available. It makes provision for hitherto poorly known African taxa and comprises the following eight tribes, five of which are newly described: Annesorhizeae, Choritaenieae, Heteromorpheae, Lichtensteinieae, Marlothielleae, Phlyctidocarpeae, Saniculeae and Steganotaenieae.
25677615|Two combinations (designated as options 1 and 2) of four plastid markers (matK, rpoC1, rpoB, psbA-trnH) that have been recommended for DNA barcoding were tested for utility in a putatively recently-diversified group: the primarily Canarian clade within the genus Tolpis (Asteraceae). Prior studies had indicated very little molecular variation in the group, and thus it was used to determine whether accepted taxa, segregate species, and morphological variants ostensibly deserving taxonomic recognition could be distinguished employing regions proposed as useful for DNA barcoding. The regions, particularly option 2, separated all morphologically distinct species of Tolpis except one, and distinguished one segregate species and certain variants in a morphologically variable and intergrading group (comprising both the T. laciniata and T. lagopoda species complexes). The barcoding sequences also revealed several variants that are worthy of additional study in order to further understand the diversity of Tolpis in the Canary Islands.
25677616|We have developed a simple and fast procedure for the purification of PCR-quality DNA from cultured lichen photobionts. This new one-step method uses the solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) combined with heat treatment to chemically breakdown algal and plant tissues. The DMSO-DNA extracts may be directly precipitated and purified by standard techniques in a total time of approximately 30 min. Compared to other DNA extraction protocols, the DMSO-based method suppresses the need for liquid nitrogen, any extraction buffer, grinding, phenol, and long incubation or centrifugation steps, thereby considerably reducing the possibility of contamination. In addition, minimal amounts of starting material (5  1020  10 cells from liquid or agarized cultures) produce sufficient DNA for 200 PCR reactions approximately, making this protocol a practical option for colony screening. This method works well in a wide range of cultured lichen photobionts and reduces the amount of labor-intensive steps and time consumed by other multi-step procedures, allowing for efficient processing of an increased number of samples.
25677617|For centuries, botanists have collected plant specimens across the Guianas (Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana). In this paper, we describe the construction of a comprehensive angiosperm specimen database for the Guianas and examine: (1) the historical accumulation of species and specimens; (2) the pattern of geographical expansion of collecting efforts; (3) the distribution of specimen records among families, genera, species, growth forms and countries. The cleaned database contained 168,487 specimen records belonging to 7146 species. The specimen records showed uneven distribution among families, genera, species, growth forms and countries. Although there was some species overlap between and among countries, unique species were collected in each country. Despite the high collecting efforts, many areas still remain under-collected.
25677618|The Macaronesian Islands comprise the Atlantic archipelagos of Azores, Madeira, Selvagens, Canaries and Cape Verde. These islands were a major focus for plant exploration during the 17th and 18th centuries. Sir Hans Sloane (16601753), one of the most important patrons and sponsors of natural sciences and botanical research, visited Madeira on his way to Jamaica in 1687. Although he stayed in Madeira for only three days, he collected plant specimens of 38 taxa (including one brown alga) and made important observations concerning the flora and fauna of Madeira from near Funchal. Sixty-six polynomial names of plants from the island are recorded in Sloane's published work along with 18 copperplate engravings, ostensibly from Madeira, although our study shows that only thirteen of them are of taxa occurring on the island. Fourteen of the sixty-six polynomials reported by Sloane relate to Macaronesian endemic taxa, six of them restricted to Madeira. Our study shows that nine of the fifteen polynomials that he putatively recorded for Madeira and/or the Antilles or for which he was unsure of their origin are from the West Indies and do not occur on this Macaronesian island. Two of the taxa that are listed for Madeira and the Caribbean Islands were likely to be present in both insular systems. Although there is evidence of earlier botanical explorations in Macaronesia, the herbarium collections made by Sloane in Madeira represent the earliest documented plant hunting expedition to Macaronesia, and Sir Hans Sloane can be considered as one of the pioneers of botanical exploration in these Atlantic Islands. Sloane's records provide an early floristic study of a diverse island flora.
25677619|The suggestion that the procedure by which the Nomenclature Section of the XVII International Botanical Congress in Vienna in 2005 approved the conservation of the name Acacia with A. penninervis as conserved type was "invalid" and that as a result the conservation proposal was not approved by that Congress is demonstrated to be false. The corollary suggestion that the inclusion of Acacia as a conserved name in the Vienna Code might be questioned at the next Congress when that Code is proposed for ratification is consequently untenable and contrary to Art. 14.8 of the ICBN. An alternative procedure for those who feel that retaining A. penninervis as the type of Acacia will lead to disadvantageous nomenclatural changes is outlined. The authors acknowledge that the process for handling recommendations on conservation, especially by the Nomenclature Section, requires both clarification and improvement and they commit the Bureau of Nomenclature for the XVIII IBC to address this in co-operation with the General Committee and other interested parties.
25677620|Article 36.1 of the International code of botanical nomenclature (McNeill & al., 2006) requires that, as from 1 January 1935, all names of new plant taxa (algae and fossils excepted) can be validly published only if they are accompanied by a Latin description or diagnosis or by a reference to an effectively published Latin diagnosis or description. Although several past Nomenclature Section meetings have voted on proposals to have this requirement lifted, the liberation of plant nomenclature, and by implication plant taxonomy, from this impediment remains elusive. We argue that the Latin requirement must be removed now as it represents a relict that does not serve the purposes for which it was originally intended. Previous proposals to delete the requirement of a Latin description or diagnosis for the valid publication of a plant name have all had strings attached. We propose (Figueiredo & al. in Taxon 59: 659660, this issue) that, as from the effective date of the Melbourne Code (a suitable date after the Melbourne Congress), a diagnosis or description in any language would suffice to effect valid publication of a plant name, the algae and fossils excepted, provided all of the other provisions for valid publication have been satisfied.
25677621|The retroactive Art. 30.5 in the Vienna Code published in 2006 is discussed with respect to "internal evidence" for the intention of achieving effective publication. In the case of retroactive application of this article, the consideration of "external evidence" is also proposed.
25677622|We present the rather unusual case of the spelling of the epithet 'rachodes'. In 1833 Vittadini described a new agaric species with the name Agaricus rachodes, but supplied no etymology. A variant spelling 'rhacodes' was first printed in 1849, apparently as a random mistranscription, but gained increasing currency from about the mid 1870s, and both names have been in use ever since. Two possible roots for the name are the Greek words '' (rag) and '' (bush, quickset hedge), for which transliterated derivations may vary from 'racodes' to 'rhachodes'. Since Vittadini's consistent spelling cannot be considered an orthographic error, the original spelling has to be retained (ICBN Art. 60.1). A proposal to conserve the alternative spelling 'rhacodes' could be based only on its preponderant use, a situation that has never existed during the 175 year history of the name, and certainly does not exist now. In order to resolve this impasse, a proposal is published separately to conserve Agaricus rachodes with the original spelling 'rachodes' under ICBN Art. 14.11, as a means of enforcing Art. 60.1.
25677623|In a synopsis of the nomenclature of the Eurasian and African species of the so-called vagrant manna lichens twelve species are recognized. The group is included in the genus Aspicilia. Most of the accepted and synonymous names are typified. Special attention was paid to the numerous infraspecific entities published by the Russian lichenologists A.A. Elenkin and K.S. Mereschkowsky. The new combination Aspicilia fruticulosofoliacea (Elenkin) Sohrabi is proposed.
25677624|The lectotype designation of Zamia erosa O.F. Cook & G.N. Collins by Eckenwalder (1980) is corrected to a neotype as it does not constitute original material on which Cook & Collins based their description. The neotype designation is itself superseded, as the specimen selected by Eckenwalder is in serious conflict with the protologue, a conclusion based on overlooked descriptive and geographic information in the protologue, and new collections recently made near the type locality. A new neotype is designated. We have further determined that Z. erosa is an earlier validly published name for the species currently known as Zamia amblyphyllidia D.W. Stev.
25677660|The recent classification of angiosperms by Chase and Reveal, based on APG III and emphasizing holophyletic concepts, results in a system of 16 coordinate superorders. Some of these contain very little diversity, such as Amborellanae or Ceratophyllanae, and others are extremely rich, such as Lilianae (monocots) or Rosanae. It is argued that the very diverse basal angiosperm group may represent ancient early lines of evolution (early evolutionary experiments) that have come from different seed fern ancestors. A reasonable approach to the classification of this mixed group is to regard them as a paraphyletic class of angiosperms (Archaeangiospermae). This allows the eudicots and monocots to be treated, as often in the past, as class Dicotyledonae and class Monocotyledonae.
25677662|The monogeneric subtribe Echinopsinae of Cynareae (Asteraceae) was analysed using nrDNA ITS and plastid trnL-trnF for 81 of the ca. 120 species, representing all Echinops sections except Cenchrolepis and Pterolepis. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses were used for each dataset and for the combined data. The resulting molecular phylogenetic framework resolves Echinops as monophyletic and confirms the inclusion of E. acantholepis (= Acantholepis orientalis) within the genus. Echinops is divided into two lineages, one consisting of E. sect. Chamaechinops and sect. Acantholepis (almost exclusively annual or biennial), and the other the remaining sections (almost all perennial). Our results support an infrageneric classification of Echinops into nine previously recognized sections: Acantholepis (= Nanechinops), Chamaechinops, Echinops (= Terma), Hamolepis, Hololeuce, Oligolepis, Phaeochaete, Psectra and Ritropsis, all resolved as strongly monophyletic after some species relocations. The status of E. sect. Phaeochaete and the sectional assignment of E. onopordum, E. pungens and E. transcaucasicus remain to be clarified. The evolution of involucral bracts is congruent with the phylogenetic framework and supports the sectional classification. Annual pollen type does not constitute an autapomorphy of the clade grouping the annuals but may represent the ancestral character state for the entire genus.
25677663|Eleocharis R. Br. is an ecologically and economically important genus that contains about 250 species of annual and perennial sedges, with centers of diversity in seasonally wet tropical to subtropical regions. Phylogenetic relationships in the genus are poorly understood, particularly in relation to three monotypic generaEgleria L.T. Eiten, Chillania Roivainen, and Websteria (Poir.) S. Hooperwhich have been variously included or excluded from Eleocharis in different classifications. These genera, while morphologically distinct, show characteristics that fall within the range of variation seen in Eleocharis. The relationship between the clade containing Eleocharis and these segregate genera (i.e., Eleocharideae) and the rest of Cyperaceae has also been difficult to determine from previous studies, and numerous conflicting hypotheses have been suggested. To address these uncertainties, we sequenced cpDNA from the ndhF and psbB-psbH marker regions and used it to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of Eleocharis and a broad sample of other Cyperaceae. We found that Egleria and Websteria are derived from within Eleocharis, and that this clade, representing the Eleocharideae, is sister to the Abildgaardieae. Chillania could not be included in the molecular dataset, but its morphology suggests it should be included in Eleocharis. New nomenclature is suggested to place the species of Chillania, Egleria, and Websteria in Eleocharis. Our phylogenetic reconstructions also indicate several other instances of generic paraphyly in other Cyperaceae lineages.
25677664|Phylogenetic relationships of Adenocarpus species were assessed by sequence analyses of the ITS and 3' end of ETS (nrDNA) regions and the trnL-trnF intergenic spacer (cpDNA). The nrDNA analysis recovered four main clades within Adenocarpus. Clades 13 comprise morphological and molecularly well-differentiated species that occur in the western Mediterranean realm. Clade 4 comprises three distinctive endemic species from the Canary Islands, an endangered Algerian endemic, and a set of species close to A. complicatus with distinct geographical areas but with little molecular variation between taxa. The latter species are centred in the Iberian Peninsula but also distributed along the Mediterranean basin (from the Iberian Peninsula to Turkey). The phylogenetic position of A. mannii, a morphologically distinctive species with a unique afro-tropical distribution, is not unequivocally resolved, being sister to clade 3 in the ETS tree but to clade 4 in the ITS tree. Rates of evolution and ages of divergence of major groups were estimated using nonparametric rate smoothing with a fixed calibration point of 41.2 Ma and constraining the node of the separation of Anarthrophyllum and Mediterranean Genisteae at a minimum age of 13.6 and a maximum of 25.8 Ma. The estimated ages indicate that the diversification of Adenocarpus and first separation of two lineages may have occurred during the onset and the wake of the profound Middle Miocene cooling episode. One of the lineages separated rapidly into two groups (clades 1 and 2) while the second one led to clade 3, A. mannii and clade 4. Clades 1, 2 and 3 differentiated into the present species soon after these major events whereas clade 4 radiated much later, during the Pliocene.
25677665|Solanum sect. Pteroidea is a lineage of ten species of neotropical herbs and vines with a center of distribution in the eastern Andean slopes. It is a member of the Potato clade of Solanum, a group that includes the potato (S. tuberosum) and tomato (S. lycopersicum). Members of S. sect. Pteroidea are characterized by inflorescences that emerge from the leaf axils and rugose, sharply pointed fruits in most species. The aim of this study is to infer phylogenetic relationships among sixteen species of Solanum, including all ten species of S. sect. Pteroidea, using DNA sequence data from the chloroplast trnT-trnF and five nuclear regions: ITS, the granule bound starch synthase gene (GBSSI or waxy), and three Conserved Orthologous Set II (COSII) markers. Results provide strong support for the monophyly of S. sect. Pteroidea and for its sister group relationship to S. sect. Herpystichum. Solanum mite, one of the most widespread and morphologically variable species in the section, is not monophyletic. Bayesian analyses using a total evidence concatenated approach and a coalescent approach implemented in BEST produced largely congruent topologies. The total evidence trees, however, were much more highly supported than the BEST trees. Although not useful individually in S. sect. Pteroidea, the three COSII markers were easy to amplify, provided clean sequences, and were tremendously useful in increasing resolution and support among the closely related species of S. sect. Pteroidea in combined analyses.
25677666|With about 335 species, the tribe Melaleuceae comprises a major lineage within the Australian Myrtaceae. Here we investigate relationships within Melaleuceae using cpDNA sequences (ndhF) and 27 morphological characters. We find strong evidence for the non-monophyly of Melaleuca, with all other currently recognized genera of Melaleuceae (Beaufortia, Calothamnus, Conothamnus, Eremaea, Lamarchea, Petraeomyrtus, Phymatocarpus, Regelia) falling within that genus. Our findings are broadly consistent with previous studies using nuclear ITS DNA sequence data; however, the cpDNA phylogeny estimate is more resolved and has higher support for major nodes. Melaleuceae is found to comprise three major clades, each containing species of Melaleuca and each with good support. The M. leucadendra (broad-leaf paper-barks), M. uncinata, M. pungens and M. acacioides groups, New Caledonian callistemons, and all other currently recognized genera of Melaleuceae form one clade. Australian Callistemon species, which have been synonymised recently with Melaleuca, cluster within a second clade of Melaleuca that includes the M. fulgens, M. laxiflora and M. ordinifolia groups, and some members of the M. lanceolata and M. cuticularis groups. A third clade includes other members of the M. lanceolata and M. cuticularis groups, M. foliolosa and the M. huegelii group. No morphological support or diagnostic synapomorphies are identified for any of these clades. Together with previous studies, our findings indicate that the circumscription of Melaleuca, and the generic status of other genera within Melaleuceae, is poorly supported, and we propose that all genera within the Melaleuceae are synonymised with Melaleuca.
25677667|Rubieae are centered in temperate regions and characterized by whorls of leaf-like structures on their stems. Previous studies that primarily included Old World taxa identified seven major clades with no resolution between and within clades. In this study, a molecular phylogeny of the tribe, based on three chloroplast regions (rpoB-trnC, trnC-psbM, trnL-trnF-ndhJ) from 126 Old and New World taxa, is estimated using parsimony and Bayesian analyses. Seven major clades are strongly supported within the tribe, confirming previous studies. Relationships within and between these seven major clades are also strongly supported. In addition, the position of Callipeltis, a previously unsampled genus, is identified. The resulting phylogeny is used to examine geographic distribution patterns and evolution of leaf-like whorls in the tribe. An Old World origin of the tribe is inferred from parsimony and likelihood ancestral state reconstructions. At least eight subsequent dispersal events into North America occurred from Old World ancestors. From one of these dispersal events, a radiation into North America, followed by subsequent diversification in South America, occurred. Parsimony and likelihood ancestral state reconstructions infer the ancestral whorl morphology of the tribe as composed of six organs. Whorls composed of four organs are derived from whorls with six or more organs. Transitions between four and six or more organs per whorl are common within the tribe, whereas reduction to two leaves at a node is derived and rare.
25677668|Tabernaemontaneae (Rauvolfioideae, Apocynaceae) are small trees with mainly animal-dispersed fleshy fruits and arillate seeds represented in the tropics of Africa, Asia, the Pacific and America. The tribe is characterized by complex indole alkaloids, thus its species play a prominent role in traditional medicine. Taxonomically, the Tabernaemontaneae have a convoluted history fraught with contention as to tribal, subtribal, generic and sectional delimitation, with some authors recognizing Ambelanieae and Macoubeeae as separate tribes and others including them in an expanded Tabernaemontaneae s.l. In the species-rich pantropical genus Tabernaemontana, seven sections and up to 30 segregate genera have been described during the past 100 years, giving it the dubious distinction of being the most disputed genus in Apocynaceae s.str. Here 420 new chloroplast DNA sequences from 104 species, including representatives of all satellite genera ever recognized in the Tabernaemontaneae, were analyzed phylogenetically to evaluate previous circumscriptions of Tabernaemontaneae and test the sectional treatment of Tabernaemontana. The Tabernaemontaneae s.l. as currently circumscribed was shown to be monophyletic. Of the 19 genera recognized in the most recent classification, 15 are maintained. The genera Bonafousia, Stemmadenia, Stenosolen and Woytokowskia are nested within Tabernaemontana. Of the seven current sections of Tabernaemontana, the four that included taxa from more than one continent were found to be para- or polyphyletic. All natural groups recovered within Tabernaemontana were found to correspond to geographic areas. Mapping of 29 selected morphological characters onto the molecular tree recovered recurrent suites of co-occurring character states and identified three synapomorphies characterizing the Tabernaemontaneae s.l.: (1) specialized anthers with massive lignified guide-rails; and a differentiated style-head with (2) a five-lobed upper crest and (3) a thickened basal flange. A new combination for the subtribe Ambelaniinae and the necessary new combinations resulting from merging Stemmadenia into Tabernaemontana are made.
25677669|Phylogenetic relationships of the aquatic moss genus Platyhypnidium and terrestrial species of Rhynchostegium were explored using a phylogeny based on three DNA sequence regions, the nuclear ITS1-5.8S-ITS2, and the plastid trnL-F and trnD-T. This is the first study using trnD-T in the phyogeny of mosses. Platyhypnidium appeared polyphyletic and most of its species were found within a Rhynchostegium clade including species from four different genera: Rhynchostegium, Eriodon, Eurhynchiella and Platyhypnidium. Use of the name Rhynchostegium requires conservation against Eriodon. Within Rhynchostegium s.l., aquatic Rhynchostegium species (i.e., Platyhypnidium) were resolved in four geographically delimited groups: an Afro-European group, an AmericanEast Asiatic group, a Malesian-Australian group and a group comprising the South American P. fuegianum together with Eriodon and Eurhynchiella. Topologies from independent analyses of plastid and nuclear data did not show conflict, and the occurrence of hybridzation events in the clade was therefore not supported. The phylogeny indicates numerous habitat shifts between terrestrial and aquatic habitats, as well as between different terrestrial (epiphytic and epigeic) habitats, which may have affected taxonomic complexity in Rhynchostegium. New morphological characters, such as a striate leaf lamina, axillary hairs composed of relatively short cells, and clearly differentiated cells of the costa, separate Platyhypnidium species within Eurhynchioideae from those in the Oxyrrhynchium-Donrichardsia clade (Helicodontioideae). Two morphologically unique specimens, Platyhypnidium muellerii from Hawaii and Platyhypnidium sp. from Northern Australia, are described as Donrichardsia bartramii and Rhynchostegium brevinerve. The new genus Hedenaesia (Helicodontioideae) is established to accommodate Platyhypnidium austrinum.
25677670|Ranunculeae represent a highly diverse and cosmopolitan tribe within Ranunculaceae. Because of the great diversity of morphological features and lack of molecular phylogeny for the tribe, the classification of its genera has always been controversial. We report here molecular phylogenetic analyses based on nuclear and plastid markers (nrITS, matK, trnK, psbJ-petA) that provide a framework for understanding relationships and character evolution within the tribe. Maximum parsimony analyses suggest a weakly supported basal dichotomy, while Neighbor Net analysis indicates strong support for five distinct lineages. Both methods revealed several well-supported, small terminal clades which correspond to previously described genera, characterised by unique morphological features and character combinations. Anatomical structures of the achenes suggested relationships with greatest concordance to those in the molecular phylogeny. Macroscopic analysis of achene morphology often indicated parallel evolution of structures related to certain dispersal mechanisms. Characters of perianth, androecium, gynoeceum and pollen are highly homoplasious, but several features characteristic of small terminal clades and terminal branches can be observed. Geographic isolation and adaptions may have triggered the evolution of morphological characters. We conclude that a classification accepting several small genera (Arcteranthis, Beckwithia, Callianthemoides, Ceratocephala, Coptidium, Cyrtorhyncha, Ficaria, Halerpestes, Hamadryas, Krapfia, Kumlienia, Laccopetalum, Myosurus, Oxygraphis, Paroxygraphis, Peltocalathos, Trautvetteria) and a large genus Ranunculus s.str. (including Batrachium, Aphanostemma and Gampsoceras) reflects best the molecular phylogeny and morphological diversity of the tribe.
25677671|Noncoding chloroplast DNA sequences are widely employed markers in plant species-level phylogenetics and phylogeography. However, chloroplast capture (hybridization) and incomplete sorting of ancestral lineages could confound phylogenetic inference using chloroplast DNA. Recently, we studied the phylogenetic of Allium subg. Melanocrommyum based on nuclear rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences and showed that, although the subgenus is monophyletic, most sections are either para- or polyphyletic. To get insights from the chloroplast genome we sequenced the plastid trnL-trnF region in 434 individuals representing 100 species of A. subg. Melanocrommyum and found 74 chloroplast haplotypes. The sequences were analyzed using tree-based (Bayesian and maximum parsimony) and network-based (statistical parsimony network) approaches. The analyses revealed high level of chloroplast haplotype sharing among up to 15 species, as well as presence of several closely related haplotypes within single species. Several characteristics of the data violate the main assumptions of standard tree building methods that is the persistence of ancestral haplotypes and their co-existence with descendant alleles as well as multifurcating relationships among these alleles. The taxon groups inferred from chloroplast trnL-trnF sequence analyses were congruent with the nuclear phylogeny. Thus, bi- and uniparentally inherited datasets strongly contradict the morphology-based taxonomic classification of A. subg. Melanocrommyum. Also, the present study (1) reports a trnF gene duplication in A. subg. Melanocrommyum, (2) infers few putative homoploid hybrid taxa, and (3) shows that natural interspecies hybrids occur rarely in the subgenus. Generally, our data strongly advocate including multiple accessions per species in species-level phylogenetic studies, and show the advantages of networks over tree building methods for analyzing sequences from noncoding chloroplast loci in closely related species.
25677672|Phylogenetic relationships of the genera Cladia and Heterodea were reconstructed using a combined dataset of nuclear ITS, nuclear LSU and mitochondrial SSU rDNA sequences. Based on different analyses (Bayesian approach, maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood), the ingroup (Cladia + Heterodea) is strongly supported as monophyletic. Pilophorus strumaticus has a well supported sister-group relationship to the ingroup and together they form a sister group with a well-supported clade, which includes Metus conglomeratus and Pycnothelia papillaria. The Shimodaira-Hasegawa test and the ELW test significantly rejected monophyly of Cladia excluding Heterodea. Within Cladia three main clades can be distinguished which share morphological and chemical characters. The position of the foliose genus Heterodea within the fruticose Cladia is supported by anatomical and chemical characters. The species of clade II that includes two Cladia species and Heterodea share a similar type of upper cortex and two-layered medulla with an inner or lower medulla consisting of dark pigmented, thick-walled hyphae. Our phylogenetic estimate and the anatomical studies indicate that the foliose thallus of Heterodea originated from pseudopodetia of Cladia. It is discussed that the species currently classified in Cladia and Heterodea need to be placed in the same genus.
25677673|This study presents a description of the morphology and anatomy of the fruits and seeds of Adoxa, Sambucus, and Viburnum. A phylogenetic study included Adoxa moschatellina, Sinadoxa corydalifolia, Sambucus, Tetradoxa omeiensis, and Viburnum. All major clades of Caprifoliaceae, the sister family of Adoxaceae, were sampled and used as outgroup. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference optimality criteria were used to analyze three datasets, molecular data (ITS, trnK, matK), morphological data (21 fruit and seed characters), and a combined dataset. We used parsimony optimization to study character evolution. Results of the phylogenetic analyses were congruent with previously published results. Viburnum is the basalmost lineage in the family and sister to subfamily Adoxoideae. In Adoxoideae, Sambucus is sister to the Adoxina clade (i.e., Adoxa, Sinadoxa, and Tetradoxa). Our results also confirmed the sister relationship between Sinadoxa corydalifolia and Adoxa plus Tetradoxa. For the first time, clear autapomorphies are described for Sambucus, such as a long, slender, cylindrical embryo, sclereids with a u-shaped sclerification pattern, a rugose endocarp surface, and numerous, small calcium oxalate crystals in the endocarp sclereids. Character evolution in Sambucus, however, is complex and a broader sampling is required to draw firm conclusions. The evolution toward Viburnum is marked by a number of shifts such as the development of small, amorphous crystals in endosperm cells and a well-developed, parenchymatous seed coat. Based on our results and previous studies we hypothesize a paedomorphic event took place at the origin of Adoxina. Evidence supporting this hypothesis is the presence of green fruits, weakly sclerified endocarp sclereids, small seeds, and semi-inferior ovaries in Adoxina. Finally, our results indicate that the first Adoxaceae were characterized by tricarpellate ovaries with an endocarp composed of an outer layer of sclereids and an inner layer of fibers. A thorough study of the fruits and seeds of Sinadoxa and Tetradoxa is vital to fully understand fruit and seed evolution in Adoxaceae.
25677674|The reproductive biology of the mycoheterotrophic Voyria caerulea, V. clavata and V. rosea (Gentianaceae) was studied in French Guiana. Floral characteristics indicated adaptations to long-tongued flower visitors. The three species possess large, conspicuously colored flowers that produced sucrose-rich nectar (concentrations: 16.4%23.9%) and emit a rosy floral perfume with a citrus-related aspect, dominated by terpenoids. Principal scent compounds of V. caerulea and V. rosea were (E)-nerolidol and geraniol, and (E)-8-oxo--farnesene [(E)-2,6-dimethyl-10-methylenedodeca-2,6,11-trien-5-one, a new natural product] and (E,E)-farnesyl acetate in V. clavata. Germinating pollen grains were observed in the anthers of all species, forming large interwoven clumps that were transferred by the pollinators as a unit. In V. caerulea and V. rosea, stamens and stigmas were positioned close together, enabling the plants to self-pollinate. In contrast, male and female organs are widely separated in V. clavata. Pollen to ovule ratios of all species were low (3378), indicating that pollen transfer (either by selfing or by outcrossing) is very efficient. Flower visitors were butterflies (V. caerulea, V. rosea) and/or long-tongued bees of the genus Euglossa (V. clavata, V. rosea). Nevertheless, Voyria caerulea and V. rosea were visited only rarely and irregularly. We suggest that these two species follow a mixed selfing-outcrossing strategy to ensure seed production when pollen transfer by visitors fails. In contrast, V. clavata showed a high degree of specialization towards euglossine-pollinators, which were frequent visitors. The close plant-pollinator interaction increases the probability of outcrossings and might have enabled this species to completely rely on pollinators for reproduction. Average seed set in the studied species ranged between 36% and 49% and was very variable among individuals, probably due to resource-limitation. The capsules of V. caerulea and V. clavata showed characteristics of endozoochorous dispersal and were frequently found damaged by possible rodent dispersal agents.
25677675|Within Menispermaceae, endocarp shape is highly variable and often characteristic. This study applied geometric morphometrics to the investigation of horseshoe-shaped endocarps that characterized the former Menispermeae tribe. The shape of 823 endocarp specimens, representing 66 species and 16 genera, were described on the lateral face by the means of 4 landmarks and 18 semilandmarks. The general Procrustes analysis was used to remove size and orientation of the specimens. Using thin-plate splines, we were able to visualize and describe the variation in shape for each genus and/or species. The main differences concern the symmetry/asymmetry of endocarp, the relative size of condyle, the relative length of ventral face and the concavity of ventral face. The results of a PCA reveal that for all genera except Diploclisia, generic variability is explained by a continuum in intra- and interspecific variability. Endocarp shape differed significantly between genera, demonstrating the potential for geometric morphometrics in fossil identification. Allometry explained only a small part of shape variation. Phylogenetic content is evaluated by comparing the results of cluster analysis with recent molecular phylogenies. Endocarp shape affinities appear to be quite different from phylogenetic relationships, demonstrating the low phylogenetic signal in endocarp shape at the family level. However, stronger variation is found in the lineages leading to modern genera. With a known phylogeny, geometric morphometrics is a good tool to understand shape evolution.
25677676|Sargassum is one of the morphologically most complex phaeophyceaen genera, and is divided into subgenera, sections, subsections, series and species groups based on highly polymorphic characters. Recent DNA analyses have highlighted incongruities in the traditional classification of the genus and especially within Sargassum subg. Sargassum sect. Acanthocarpicae. Our goal was to re-assess the relationships among taxa currently attributed to this section in the Pacific basin. We undertook the taxonomic study in two main steps: (1) the morphological examination of large collections from inter-tropical Pacific islands and type specimens from worldwide localities; and (2) DNA analyses using a set of three markers (ITS-2, partial rbcLS-operon, cox3). Morphological and DNA analyses confirmed that S. sect. Acanthocarpicae is based on unsuitable morphological characters and is not monophyletic. On the basis of the study, we propose (1) abandoning subsections within S. sect. Acanthocarpicae; (2) synonymization of S. sect. Acanthocarpicae and sect. Malacocarpicae with sect. Sargassum; and (3) the elevation of S. ser. Ilicifoliae and ser. Binderianae to sectional rank as well as their re-description according to new sets of morphological characters.
25677677|Recent phylogenetic work shows that existing tribal concepts within Nyctaginaceae are incompatible with the principle of recognizing monophyletic taxa. We review the history of supergeneric classification in Nyctaginaceae, clarify issues pertaining to priority of certain generic names, and discuss the application of the conserved family name to the tribe Nyctagineae. Pisoniella and Phaeoptilum and moved from tribe Nyctagineae to Pisonieae and Bougainvilleeae, respectively, while tribe Abronieae, containing Abronia and Tripterocalyx, is submerged into Nyctagineae. Two distinctive genera, Caribea and Colignonia, are assigned to their own tribes, recognizing both their uniqueness and the uncertainty of their phylogenetic relationships. Finally, subtribes are not recognized in tribe Nyctagineae. Updated descriptions are provided for each tribe and one new tribe, Caribeaeae Douglas & Spellenberg, is recognized. Plant habit and general geographic distribution seem to be at least as pertinent as the often-homoplasious morphological details which had been emphasized in previous classifications.
25677678|A new genus of grammitid ferns, Leucotrichum, is described. Segregated from Lellingeria on the basis of molecular analyses and morphological characters, it comprises five species distributed in the Antilles, Central America, and Southeastern Brazil. We present a phylogeny based on two cpDNA genes, atpB and rbcL, showing the relationships between Leucotrichum and other genera of grammitid ferns. Both Bayesian and Maximum Parsimony analyses support the monophyly of Leucotrichum, with bootstrap value of 100% and posterior probability value of 1.0, and its sister-group relationship to the Terpsichore lanigera group. Leucotrichum is characterized by seven morphological characters: arching fronds, clathrate rhizome scales, blackish rhizome scale cell walls, laterally marginate petioles, laminar apices subconform to the lateral pinnae, pinna costae without blackish sclerenchyma, and hairs bearing acicular branch cells. We also provide a key, descriptions, complete synonymy, discussions, specimens examined, and illustrations for all the species.
25677679|FRIDA (FRiendly IDentificAtion) is a new software application for producing multi-authored interactive identification keys, which can be published on the Web, stored on optical devices, and used on mobile devices as PDAs and Smartphones, both on-line or in stand-alone mode. FRIDA is based on a double-level architecture, which grants to the authors that are involved in multi-authored projects a high degree of independence while working on their data, and several instruments to control and modify the final result of the elaboration of the keys. FRIDA can produce keys from the data by one author only, as well as keys from data by several different authors, merged together into new and original entities. In this paper we discuss the most interesting features of the FRIDA package, and detail the process of generation of an identification key.
25677680|The tropical, subtropical and some temperate regions of the world are home to large components of the known global flora. However, the herbaria in these countries, often classified as so-called emerging economies, hold a fraction of the votes that influence and decide proposals to amend the International code of botanical nomenclature. We argue that the allocation of votes to herbaria should more closely reflect the richness of the plant diversity of the country in which the herbarium is situated, as well as the size of the population using the names associated with the flora. Globally, in every single sphere of life and human endeavour, minority rule is not only frowned upon, it is rejected, often with contempt. There is no reason why, in the second decade of the 21st century, decision-making in plant nomenclature should be affected by a minority of institutions from countries with some of the world's most depauperate floras. The way in which some nomenclature committees, and the Nomenclature Section itself, have advocated a particular point of view on the typification of the genus name Acacia Mill. at the International Botanical Congress held in Vienna in 2005 has indicated just how far developing nations and continents have been left behind in the plant nomenclature debate. The IAPT could now proactively initiate a debate and process that will ultimately ensure a better representation for neglected herbaria, and therefore the countries in which they are situated, that lack a voice in plant nomenclatural matters.
25677681|The nomenclature of Podocarpus angustifolius Griseb. and P. aristulatus Parl., names applied to two taxonomically distinct Cuban species of Podocarpus sect. Pumilis (Podocarpaceae), is discussed. Both names are based on material collected by Charles Wright. The complexities of typifying names based on this collector's material are summarised, emphasising that material bearing the same "Wright number" cannot always be considered duplicate type material, Wright's numbers being distribution not collection numbers. In this particular case, the dioecy of Podocarpus further complicates matters because the original material of P. angustifolius at GOET, formerly regarded as a holotype, consists of two shoots of different sexes, plus detached seeds that are more mature than those on the mounted female shoot. We demonstrate that these three elements all have different provenances and must be regarded as syntypes. The name Podocarpus angustifolius Griseb. is lectotypified by the detached seeds at GOET, and a supporting epitype designated to fix the application of the name. Podocarpus aristulatus Parl. was based partly on the type of the earlier name P. angustifolius Griseb. of which Parlatore was unaware. However, Parlatore did not see all syntypes present in Grisebach's original material of that name; moreover his name P. aristulatus has been consistently applied to a taxonomically different entity from eastern Cuba, rather than western Cuba where the lectotype of Podocarpus angustifolius was collected. In order to maintain nomenclatural stability it is recommended that P. aristulatus be either lectotypified or conserved with a new conserved type. The latter option is favoured and a separate proposal to that effect is being published simultaneously.
25677682|The date and method of publication of Lindenia Benth. (Rubiaceae) are discussed.
25677683|Orobanche santolinae Loscos & J. Pardo, which is frequently considered a synonym of O. artemisiae-campestris or O. picridis, is lectotypified here from Loscos's original material in the herbarium of the Botany Department of the University of Coimbra (COI). A morphological description focusing on the particular characters which distinguish it from related species is provided. Orobanche santolinae occurs in western areas of the European Mediterranean region (viz., east and south of the Iberian Peninsula and south-west of France), it is considered to belong to the O. minor group and warrant recognition at species level.
25677684|Phylogenetic studies based on molecular data indicated that the Neotropical genus Anisacanthus Nees (Acanthaceae), as traditionally circumscribed, is not monophyletic. Based on the priority of the description of Thyrsacanthus ramosissimus Moric. versus the description of Thyrsacanthus Nees, we are reinstating the name Thyrsacanthus (Art. 42.1 of the ICBN) to include the South American species traditionally assigned to Anisacanthus. Drejera Nees is included in the synonymy of Thyrsacanthus, a new species (T. microphyllus A. Crtes & Rapini) is described, three new combinations are proposed, two new taxonomic synonyms at the species level indicated and three lectotypes designated. The positions of Anisacanthus trilobus Lindau and A. pohlii Lindau are uncertain, requiring further investigations.
20773972|The ongoing discourse on monophyly versus paraphyly shows apparent lack of mutual understanding among schools of biological taxonomy. The principal reason behind the frozen disagreement is that these terms were redefined repeatedly. Although terminological discrepancy has long been recognized, relatively few attempts have been made to clarify this. As a consequence, contemporary taxonomy still uses three different definitions of monophyly, and therefore paraphyly. Resolution is possible provided that the terms (a) monophyly and paraphyly are used for diachronous classifications and phylogenetic trees; (b) monoclady and paraclady for synchronous classifications and cladograms of contemporaneous organisms; and (c) monothety and non-monothety for groups in classifications derived by the pattern cladistic approach.
20773973|The nuclear gene phytochrome A (PHYA) from 71 species of crown clade Apocynaceae (subfamilies Asclepiadoideae, Secamonoideae, Periplocoideae, and four lineages of Apocynoideae) and outgroups is used to (1) test the chloroplast phylogeny that places the African tribe Baisseeae, with solitary pollen grains, as sister to the pollinia-bearing milkweeds (Secamonoideae plus Asclepiadoideae); (2) resolve the position of tetrad-bearing Periplocoideae, the proposed milkweed sister group based on morphology; (3) place the enigmatic Dewevrella; and (4) clarify relationships of the three other primary crown clade lineages: Rhabdadenia, New World clade, and Asian clade. Separate analyses of PHYA and chloroplast sequences agree in placing an African monad-bearing clade (Baisseeae plus Dewevrella) as the sister group of the milkweeds. Combined PHYA and chloroplast datasets under parsimony and maximum likelihood reject Periplocoideae as the milkweed sister group with statistical significance. Rhabdadenia is placed as sister to the rest of the crown clade, consistent with aspects of its floral morphology and wood anatomy, but without statistical support. Other relationships among the primary crown clade Apocynaceae lineages are also not supported statistically, but power analysis indicates that four to eight times as many characters (26,376-52,752 aligned positions) will be sufficient for a robust estimate.
20773974|In this paper we investigate phylogenetic relationships for Caralluma R. Br. (Apocynaceae-Asclepiadoideae-Ceropegieae), the largest genus among the stapeliads, using analyses of data from four molecular markers: two plastid regions psbA-trnH and trnT-F and two nuclear regions ITS and ncpGS. Our analyses show that the stapeliads consist of two lineages, with Caralluma dominating one of these lineages. Within this lineage, Caralluma is not monophyletic, with its species distributed among two major clades. One of these clades contains species of Caralluma and representatives of Anomalluma Plowes, Echidnopsis Hook. f. and Rhytidocaulon P.R.O. Bally, while in the other clade the small genera Edithcolea N.E. Br., Frerea Dalz. and Pseudolithos P.R.O. Bally are embedded among species of Caralluma. We discuss morphological features that characterize some of the clades. Caralluma is mainly paleotropical in its distribution and is the most widely distributed group among the stapeliads, from the Canary Islands in Macaronesia to the Indian subcontinent. We show that the Indian subcontinent has been invaded four times by species of Caralluma, while its greatest diversity is found in North-East Africa and southern Arabia.
20773975|The phylogenetic placement of the Old World Gesneriaceae genera Ramonda, Conandron, Bournea, Thamnocharis, and Tengia, all characterized by actinomorphic flowers, has been the subject of much debate. Actinomorphy in Gesneriaceae is rare, with most species exhibiting zygomorphic flowers. The actinomorphic genera have historically been considered "primitive" and lumped in the tribe Ramondeae separate from the remaining Old World Gesneriaceae. In this study, we used nuclear (ITS) and plastid (trnL-F) DNA for molecular phylogenetic analysis of these five genera along with representative species across the Cyrtandroideae. Our results show that the actinomorphic genera are scattered over several otherwise zygomorphic clades within Cyrtandroideae, and along with previous data, indicate that Ramondeae is an unnatural group. Floral actinomorphy has evolved convergently in different alliances of Old World Gesneriaceae. Ramonda is sister to Haberlea, Bournea is apparently paraphyletic, Conandron seems rather isolated, and Tengia is close to Petrocodon and sister to a group of Chirita sect. Gibbosaccus together with Calcareoboea. We hypothesize that the evolution from zygomorphy to actinomorphy with novel combinations of characters is possibly due to shifts in pollination strategies, such as a switch from nectar- to pollen-rewards.
20773976|In this paper, we use the mitochondrial region cox1 to assess the usefulness of this marker in addressing evolutionary relationships within the tribe Orchideae. Despite the low overall variation uncovered in this region, one good phylogenetic marker was identified. A large group I intron was shared across subtribe Orchidinae and some species of Habenariinae sensu Dressler. The clades identified in the cox1 tree were weakly supported, but consistent with previous studies based on nuclear ribosomal spacers (nrITS). Moreover, the phylogenetic analysis of the combined cox1/ITS data matrix allowed us to highly improve the resolution of the ITS-only analysis and confirm several previously controversial relationships. A second purpose of this study was to analyse the evolution of the group I cox1 intron in Orchideae. This intron has a patchy distribution in angiosperms that has been claimed to be mostly due to horizontal transfer events. Our results suggest that, despite the differences observed in the co-conversion tracts in the tribe, vertical transfer is more consistent with the observed phylogenetic trees.
20773977|Mentheae are the largest tribe in the family Lamiaceae and economically important, including herbs like mint, sage and thyme. The evolutionary history of this tribe was reconstructed based on ITS and trnL-trnF spacer sequence data of 71 species, representing 47 out of 65 genera. The resulting phylogeny was used to analyse the distribution of selected morphological characteristics such as sexine ornamentation of pollen, nutlet shape with existence of abscission scar and its form, and trichome types. Two monophyletic groups are recognized, which largely correspond to the current subtribal circumscription. Subtribe Salviinae is monophyletic, including the genus Melissa which was a genus of uncertain affinity in Mentheae. Subtribe Menthinae is not monophyletic since Cleonia, Horminum, Hyssopus, Lycopus and Prunella are more closely related with subtribe Nepetinae. Although we could not detect any morphological synapomorphies for each clade, morphological variation seems to be correlated with the molecular phylogeny. A circular abscission scar without distinct lateral areole occurred mainly in Salviinae, while the majority of the species of Mentheae and Nepetinae had a clear areole at the abscission scar. In addition, a reticulate sexine ornamentation is rather common in the Menthinae clade.
20773978|Ononis L. (Fabaceae, Papilionoideae) is a common genus in the circum-Mediterranean region. To infer phylogenetic relationships, 69 Ononis species were analyzed using plastid trnL-F and nuclear ITS DNA sequences. Trees resulting from maximum parsimony analysis and Bayesian inference provide evidence that Ononis is monophyletic but contradict the traditional subgeneric division in O. sects. Ononis and Natrix. However, many of the 22 subsections of the genus are well supported by the molecular data. Phylogenetic reconstructions indicate five major lineages within the genus, which are morphologically supported by peduncle length and flower color, characters which also confirm the polyphyly suggested for O. subsect. Reclinatae. Ononis subsects. Antiquae and Rhodanthae form a basally branching monophylum, confirming the findings of previous studies. An examination of the life strategies dominant in different clades and the climatic conditions in the habitats of the species in the light of the molecular data suggests that O. subsects. Ononis, Mauritanicae and Canariensis are secondarily perennial, with the latter two serving as examples of high altitude woodiness and insular woodiness.
20773979|Taxonomic complexity in wild potatoes (Solanum L. sect. Petota Dumort.) has led to widely conflicting treatments. Solanum ser. Piurana Hawkes is one of 21 series recognized in S. sect. Petota in the latest comprehensive taxonomic treatment by Hawkes in 1990. They are distributed from southern Colombia south through Ecuador to central Peru. The taxonomic limits of the series and validity of its constituent species were not resolved with previous studies. In the present study, a set of five conserved orthologous DNA markers (cos II) with 5342 bp of aligned length were used to infer the phylogeny of putative members of Solanum ser. Piurana and outgroups. The results agreed with a three-clade topology shown by previous studies within S. sect. Petota. Solanum ser. Piurana is expanded to include some species formerly included in S. sers. Conicibaccata, Cuneoalata, Ingaefolia, Olmosiana, Simplicissima, Tuberosa and Yungasensa. This expanded group is supported morphologically by the presence of moniliform tubers and coriaceous leaves in most species.
20773980|Phylogenetic relationships among core taxa of the paleotropical bamboo clade placed in subtribe Bambusinae, comprising Bambusa s.l. (including Bambusa s.str. and its subgenera Leleba and Lingnania) and its allies (including Dendrocalamopsis, Dendrocalamus, Gigantochloa, Melocalamus and Thyrsostachys), and with Neosinocalamus and Oxytenanthera, were examined by separate and combined cladistic analyses of the nuclear GBSSI gene and plastid psbA-trnH, rpl32-trnL and rps16 intron sequences using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference analyses. The taxa were strongly supported as a monophyletic group, which represents subtribe Bambusinae. Melocalamus and Thyrsostachys were confirmed as good genera. In the combined analysis, Bambusa s.l. and Dendrocalamopsis formed one of two clades with reasonable support, and Dendrocalamus clustered with Gigantochloa, Neosinocalamus and Oxytenanthera in the other. The topology also identified several taxa that were misplaced in Bambusa or Dendrocalamus. Sinocalamus (currently a subgenus of Dendrocalamus) appeared to be heterogeneous and contained taxa allied to Bambusa or Dendrocalamus. Except for Oxytenanthera, the alliance of Bambusa and allies appeared well characterized by a broadly conical, solid and typically hairy ovary summit. The taxonomic significance of rachilla and floret characters, considered useful in distinguishing subsets of genera, remains uncertain.
20773981|The flowers of Marantaceae are known for their unique pollination mechanism mediated by an explosive style movement. The mechanism is based on the highly modified elements of the inner androecial whorl, i.e., the single half-fertile anther and the fleshy and hooded staminodes. We investigated 67 species across 24 genera to elucidate which parts of the hooded staminode are shared by all species, thus likely under strong selection pressure, and which are allowed to vary. We treated hooded staminodes as character syndromes and grouped them based on gross similarities. We identified characters underlying the similarity and investigated their diversity and developmental pathways. All hooded staminodes correspond in their general morphology, development and vascularisation, suggesting they are homologous. Variable proportions, differential growth and the formation of secondary structures result in a diversity of morphologies. The hooded staminodes can be grouped into ten distinct types. These morphological types are in accordance with the accepted clades of the family indicating their phylogenetic significance. The early diverging clades are characterised by stiff and elaborate staminode structures whereas in more distantly diverging clades simplified forms appear. We conclude that elaborate structures are not essential to maintain the pollination mechanism and thus have been reduced in the course of evolution.
20773982|Cneorum trimerum (Urban) Chodat is only known from the type specimen collected in 1861 in eastern Cuba. The species has sometimes been regarded as a synonym of C. tricoccon L., which is otherwise confined to the Mediterranean. As no other Cneorum specimens are known from Cuba, the specimen is a mysterious finding with a disputed taxonomic rank. The goal of this study is to clarify the status of the Cuban specimen using molecular and wood anatomical data. We succeeded in extracting DNA out of the 150 year old type specimen in our ancient-DNA lab and amplified two chloroplast markers (atpB, trnL-trnF) and one nuclear marker (ITS). Comparison of the sequence data with several sequences from C. tricoccon clearly suggests inclusion of the Cuban specimen into the latter species; wood anatomical features confirm the molecular results. The transatlantic distribution of C. tricoccon is probably the result of an introduction in Cuba by humans.
20773983|Previous morphological and molecular studies indicate that Syngonanthus is polyphyletic. Syngonanthus sect. Syngonanthus and S. sect. Carphocephalus as well as Philodice cluster in a monophyletic clade and are included in Syngonanthus. Syngonanthus sect. Eulepis and S. sect. Thysanocephalus are also a monophyletic group that can be used to reestablish Comanthera with a new circumscription and two subgenera: Comanthera subg. Comanthera and C. subg. Thysanocephalus. Characterization of Comanthera and the necessary nomenclatural combinations are provided in this paper. The genus will now include 38 species, six varieties and four subspecies. Of the species, 34 are endemic to Brazil, occurring especially in the Espinhao Range in Minas Gerais and Bahia. Three species extend from Brazil into other countries of northern South America and one is found only in Venezuela and Guyana. In this paper we also propose 43 new synonyms, 39 new combinations, one name change, three changes of status, eight lectotypifications and one neotypification.
20773984|Most of the arborescent Croton species in the New World were treated by Webster as belonging either to C. sect. Cyclostigma Griseb. or C. sect. Luntia (Neck. ex Raf.) G.L. Webster. The circumscription of C. sect. Cyclostigma has been treated recently. In this paper we focus on C. sect. Luntia, which was subdivided by Webster into two subsections, C. subsect. Matourenses and subsect. Cuneati. Using chloroplast trnL-F and nuclear ITS DNA sequence data, morphology and a broader sampling of additional Croton lineages, we found that the two subsections are not closely related and form distinct monophyletic groups. Substantial morphological differences support the molecular data. A taxonomic recircumscription of the two subsections, elevated to sectional level, is proposed. A key and taxonomic revision, with new synonyms, is provided for C. sect. Cuneati; together with the description of a new species from the coastal mountains of Venezuela, Croton domatifer. The new species is the only one in the genus known to possess leaf domatia. We infer that species in the Cuneati clade have lost the typical Croton caruncle, and some of them have evolved a different, specialized type of aril. We hypothesize that the arillate seeds are an adaptation to dispersal by fish in the Orinoco and Amazon river basins.
20773985|We present a revision of Lithospermum for South America based on extensive field work and herbarium study which leads to the recognition of ten species including five new to science: Lithospermum bolivariensis, L. cuzcoensis, L. leymebambensis and L. rodriguezii from Peru, and L. azuayensis from Ecuador. The South American species group is morphologically heterogeneous and includes a wide range of growth forms, pollen types and corolla shapes. Molecular data indicate that the species from Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia are monophyletic (South American species group) and represent the sister group of Mexican L. distichum. Lithospermum mediale, disjunct between Colombia/Venezuela and Guatemala/Mexico, represents an independent introduction to South America. Diversification of Andean Lithospermum appears to have progressed from South to North, with the basal taxa being present in the high Andes of southern Peru. The bulk of the species is concentrated in the Amotape-Huancabamba Zone (northern Peru to southern Ecuador), with five neo-endemic species being restricted to this area. Lithospermum apparently arrived in the Central Andes ca. 5 Ma and subsequently migrated and diversified northwards, possibly parallel to the uplift of the northern Andes.
20773986|Georges Bronckart (born 1881) was a Belgian orchid amateur who collected in Vietnam between ca. 1900 to 1905. He also made illustrations of some of his collections. Duplicate material was sent to the Belgian botanists Cogniaux and De Wildeman. The former described five new varieties within the genera Aerides, Dendrobium, Phalaenopsis and Stauropsis, while De Wildeman described four new species of Dendrobium based on this material. Only one of the nine taxa remains accepted today, viz. Dendrobium ochraceum De Wild., a species endemic to central Vietnam. A concise biography of Bronckart and his contribution to horticulture is presented. The taxonomic section summarizes the typification of the names based on his material, and designates lectotypes or neotypes where necessary.
20773987|This paper briefly reports on the developments surrounding the Acacia name conservation controversy since the Nomenclature Section meeting at the Seventeenth International Botanical Congress at Vienna in 2005. Actions taken at Vienna led to the listing of Acacia Mill. with a conserved type in Appendix III (p. 286) of the current printed version of the International code of botanical nomenclature. While decisions taken at Nomenclature Sections generally tend to resolve nomenclatural disputes, the actions taken in Vienna with regard to Acaciai.e., treating the proposal to conserve the name Acacia with a conserved type as approved even though the majority of the votes cast were opposed to the proposalhas only resulted in increased controversy. Today, the Acacia listing in the Code continues to be met with considerable resistance from the global plant taxonomic community and beyond. We believe the "minority rule" approach used in Vienna was contrary to the procedural rules established in Vienna. As a result, an objection to the acceptance of the Vienna Code as currently printed with the Acacia listing will be raised at the Nomenclature Section meeting during the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress in Melbourne in 2011. A procedure is outlined for handling this objection that we hope will allow the botanical community to finally resolve this matter.
20773988|The idea of allowing diagnoses in any language is disastrous and a step in the wrong direction. As the knowledge of Latin among botanists is diminishing, it is instead important to establish a multilingual Latin-dictionary on the Internet with examples of how to make diagnoses. Though the importance of the diagnosis sensu Linnaeus now is mostly covered by the type method, it is impossible to give it up as the important link between nomenclature and taxonomy (where the Linnaean description belongs entirely) and with taxonomy in the past.
20773989|Article 59.7 of the ICBN (Vienna Code) allows the epitypification of a name of a fungus, known until then only as an anamorph, with teleomorphic material in order to avoid introducing an additional name. Redhead suggested calling this procedure teleotypification. We demonstrate that it is not desirable to apply teleotypification to newly discovered teleomorphs of fungi for which a suitable teleomorph genus is available. Describing a newly found anamorphic fungus under a teleomorph-typified generic name may be defended, provided generic homogeneity is proven with molecular methods and no suitable anamorph genus is available. Alternative proposals will be submitted to either return to the previous situation without teleotypification or to restrict teleotypification explicitly to cases where the original genus is monotypic or at least clearly monophyletic, and no suitable teleomorph genus is available.
20773990|Molecular systematics is advancing rapidly, while the pool of taxonomic expertise dwindles: thus, the lag between recognising potential new species, and formally describing those species, will increase. Given the urgency of the biodiversity crisis, the existence of potential new undescribed species should be communicated as rapidly and widely as possible, thus highlighting the relevance and importance of systematics to other sciences, and to biodiversity managers, policy makers, and the general public. However, under the current botanical and zoological codes, scientists who reveal the existence of unrecognised taxa are vulnerable to having those candidate species rapidly named by unscrupulous individuals using unrefereed (and often self-published) works. This compelling argument for peer review in nomenclature has been largely overlooked in previous debates about the codes. The botanical and zoological codes need to be immediately updated to discourage such taxonomic piracy; this would encourage taxonomists to disseminate their vital biodiversity data as quickly and broadly as possible.
20773991|Work on the Global Compositae Checklist has highlighted uncertainties and errors in the nomenclatural parameters of many genera and subgenera described by Henri Cassini. Problems concern rank (subgenus vs. genus); type designation; correct place of valid publication; alternative names; and other miscellaneous issues. An annotated list with correct nomenclatural information for 391 generic names or designations is provided, including types (newly designated here for 17 names) and one new combination (Gyptis tanacetifolia). The current taxonomic disposition of Cassini's genera and the accepted names for the listed typonyms are consistently mentioned. The familiar names Felicia and Chrysopsis, already conserved, are threatened by unlisted earlier synonyms, and currently used Fulcaldea turns out to be illegitimate. Proposals to deal with these problems by conservation are being presented separately.
20773992|Loefling's Iter Hispanicum (1758) and its subsequent translations, editions, issues, and facsimiles are analyzed for their impact on the nomenclature of American vascular plants. The book, edited by Linnaeus and posthumously published, contains descriptions of plants found in Venezuela (as well as in the Iberian Peninsula). For American plants the original volume (1758) is the source of 31 new genera, 15 new species, and one replaced name, and a German translation (1766) is the source of an additional two new species. Many of these nomenclatural innovations have been ignored, overlooked, or intentionally suppressed, some for centuries. Other names in the Iter Hispanicum have been misinterpreted. We examine the reasons for considering these 49 names to be validly published and the nomenclatural ramifications. In the interests of nomenclatural stability we are forced to conclude that the names of at least ten taxa described by Loefling should be rejected: Ayenia sidiformis Loefl., Cofer Loefl., Cruzeta Loefl., Cruzeta hispanica Loefl., Edechia inermis Loefl., E. spinosa L., Justicia putata Loefl., Menais Loefl., Muco Loefl., and Samyda parviflora Loefl. Likewise the names of two species described by Linnaeus that are tied to the Iter Hispanicum should be rejected: Menais topiaria L. and Spermacoce suffruticosa L. Finally, we select neotypes for Gaura fruticosa Loefl., Salvinia michelii Loefl., and Waltheria melochioides Loefl.
20773993|The plate designated as lectotype of the name Heliotropium arborescens L. (1759) does not permit a precise application of the name. The herbarium material associated with that illustration was examined in order to clarify the identity of the type material and an epitype was selected. The epitype corresponds in morphology to the taxon called Heliotropium urbanianum K. Krause (1906) in the recent literature, which is here lectotypified and synonymized with H. arborescens. The name Heliotropium arborescens has been misapplied to a predominantly Peruvian species, which should now be correctly called Heliotropium corymbosum Ruiz & Pav. (1799). The epitypification here proposed will ensure nomenclatural stability for most material from cultivation, where the name Heliotropium arborescens is widely used.
20773994|The typification of ten Linnaean names of taxa belonging to the Valerianaceae is discussed. Lectotypes are designated from the Linnaean herbarium at LINN (Valeriana dioica, V. locusta var. discoidea, V. phu, V. tripteris), the Burser Herbarium at UPS (V. montana, V. tuberosa), and from the Clifford Herbarium at BM (V. rubra). An illustration in a pre-Linnaean work is designated as the lectotype of both V. locusta var. mutica and V. locusta var. pumila. Valeriana mixta, often treated as ambiguous, is discussed and will be proposed for formal rejection. Each type choice made here maintains the present usage of the corresponding Linnaean name.
20774033|Ecology affects each of the three principal processes leading to speciation: genetic differentiation among populations within species, acquisition of reproductive isolation among populations, and the rise of ecological differentiation among such populations, allowing them to coexist. Until recently, however, the ties between ecology and speciation in plants have received relatively little attention. This paper reviews some exciting new insights into the role of ecology in speciation, focusing on the angiosperms. I consider five main topics, including (1) the determinants of the spatial scale of genetic differentiation within species; (2) the role and limits of adaptive radiation in increasing net rates of plant diversification; (3) the potential role of ecological speciation; (4) the contributions of hybridization to speciation, adaptive radiation, and the ecological breadth of clades; and (5) the ecological determinants of net diversification rate for individual lineages, and of the species richness for regional floras. Limited dispersal, especially of seeds, favors genetic differentiation at small spatial scales and is likely to foster rapid speciation and narrow endemism. Meta-analyses show that the minimum area required for in situ speciation on islands increases with the spatial scale of gene flow in various organisms. In angiosperms, fleshy fruits dispersed by vertebrates often increase the distance over which seeds are dispersed, but can decrease it in forest understories. Nutrient-poor soils should work against the evolution of fleshy fruits and promote speciation and narrow endemism. Selection for adaptation to different conditions drives adaptive radiation, the rise of a diversity of ecological roles and attendant adaptations within a lineage. On islands, adaptive radiation often leads to woodiness, monocarpy, developmental heterophylly, and sexual dimorphism, as well as differences in habitat, growth form, and floral morphology. Adaptive radiation appears to accelerate speciation in only some plant clades. Extensive radiation in some lineages has been ascribed to early colonization, large amounts of heritable genetic variation, "genetic lines of least resistance" upon which selection could act, absence of potential competitors, and possession of "key innovations" that provide access to novel resources. To these should be added large island area, organismal abundance, saturation of ecological space, and the synergism action of limited dispersal and divergent selection producing parallel radiations in isolated regions. Data for Hawaiian lobeliads suggest that within-island species richness of Cyaneainvolving divergence in elevation and flower tube lengthsaturates within 0.6 and 1.5 Ma. Adaptive radiation in pollinators is an important mechanism of ecological speciation: adaptation to different pollinators leads to pollinator partitioning and reproductive isolation. Selection for longer nectar spurs and pollinator mouth parts led to increased speciation in Aquilegia and other groups. A similar process may work once tubular flowers evolve from cup-shaped blossoms. Selection for floral divergence may be limited in forest understories illuminated by dim, greenish light, which may account for the predominance of small, visually inconspicuous flowers in temperate and tropical understory species. Hybridization can stimulate speciation by forming transgressive phenotypes that exceed the range seen in parental taxa, and by introgressing adaptive gene combinations. The likelihood of transgressive phenotypes increases with the genetic divergence between parental taxa, so speciation via transgressive hybridization may be most likely among taxa with intermediate amounts of divergence. Several large adaptive radiations appear to have occurred after hybridization, suggesting a special role for the extensive amount of genetic variation that can be supplied and refreshed by syngameons. Rates of net species diversification are greater in herbs (especially annuals) vs. woody plants; in animal- vs. wind-pollinated species; in plants with poorly dispersed seeds; in families with a greater diversity of growth forms, pollination and seed dispersal mechanisms, and species distributions; in families at lower latitudes; in families with higher rates of genetic evolution; in hermaphroditic or monoecious vs. dioecious clades; in earlier-maturing woody plants; in plants with bilateral vs. radial flowers; in plants with hummingbird-pollinated flowers; in epiphytic vs. terrestrial bromeliads and orchids; in bromeliads differentiating along geographically extensive cordilleras; and in young vs. old clades. Evidence for the last pattern may, however, be an artifact of (auto)regressing (ln N) / t vs. t. High rates of diversification in epiphytic orchids are tied to small effective population sizes, suggesting a role for intermittent genetic drift alternating with strong selection on floral traits. Across angiosperms, a massive increase in diversification rates was preceded by a major increase in leaf vein density and hydraulic conductance between 140 and 110 Ma ago, leading to higher photosynthetic rates than coexisting ferns and gymnosperms. Based on the economic theory of plant defense, this should have led to lower allocation to anti-herbivore defenses, selecting for low-cost qualitative toxins rather than all-purpose but highly expensive qualitative defenses, triggering an arms' race between angiosperm and their herbivores. Finally, regional plant species richness increases with regional area and proxies for latitude, rainfall, topographic heterogeneity, and vegetation stratification. The Cape Floristic Province has roughly twice as many species as expected from its area and environmental conditions, most likely reflecting the predominance of short-distance dispersal associated with poor soils and myrmecochory in the Cape Province, as well as low rates of regeneration and competitive exclusion following fire.
20774034|Speciation can be viewed as the evolution of reproductive isolation between formerly interbreeding populations. Recent years have seen great advances in our understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying postmating reproductive isolation during plant speciation. Nevertheless, little is known about the early stages of species divergence and the evolution of reproductive isolation at the within species level. Direct or indirect evidence indicates that intrinsic postzygotic mechanisms are prevalent and often polymorphic among allopatric conspecific populations of plants. We review studies that report direct or indirect evidence for polymorphism of genic (i.e., gene-based) postmating reproductive isolation within species' ranges. Specifically, we focus on three genic mechanisms often held responsible for reproductive isolation between species: Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller (BDM) incompatibilities and two widespread types of genomic conflict, transmission ratio distortion and cytonuclear interactions. We further highlight the close similarity between reported cases of outbreeding depression among conspecific populations, especially those that correspond to the intrinsic co-adaptation model, and the origin of genetic incompatibilities. This association holds great promise to help improve our understanding of the processes involved in the initial stage of speciation, and it highlights the close (and often overlooked) relationship between evolutionary and conservation biology.
20774035|Homoploid hybrid speciation is the origin of a hybrid species without change in chromosome number. Although currently thought to be a rare form of speciation, especially relative to the more common allopolyploid hybrid speciation, it is feasible that many examples of homoploid hybrid species will be discovered in the future now that genetic resources are readily available for testing their occurrence. In this review, we focus on the speed of homoploid hybrid speciation, the importance of ecological and spatial isolation in the process, and the nature of genetic changes that occur in a new hybrid during its origin and establishment in the wild. With reference mainly to the extensive work carried out on homoploid hybrid species of Helianthus, and to our own work on the very recently originated diploid hybrid species Senecio squalidus, we review evidence showing: (1) that new fertile homoploid hybrid species can originate very quickly, although a longer period is likely to be required before the species becomes fully stabilized both genomically and phenotypically; (2) ecological divergence of the hybrid species from its parents is key to successful establishment, and that this can occur even in the absence of post-zygotic isolation caused by chromosomal and/or genetic sterility barriers; (3) transgressive changes in phenotypic traits and gene expression are of great importance in adapting homoploid hybrid species to habitats that are ecologically and spatially divergent from those of the parents; (4) adaptive differences distinguishing a homoploid hybrid species from its parental species are likely to be maintained in the face of parental gene flow, and evolve in concert across populations representing multiple origins of the species; (5) in the absence of parental gene flow, i.e., under conditions of geographical isolation, rapid genetic divergence of the hybrid species is likely to be enhanced due to the combined effects of founder events, genetic drift and selection.
20774036|During the past decade there has been a tremendous resurgence of interest in polyploidy that has in large part been stimulated by the development of increasingly powerful genetic and genomic tools. The result has been numerous new insights into the genomic and genetic consequences of polyploidy. The plethora of new discoveries has dramatically reshaped traditional views and concomitantly revealed that polyploidy is a highly dynamic and ubiquitous process. These recent advances in our understanding of polyploidy have stimulated numerous reviews, most focused on the various genetic, epigenetic, and genomic consequences of polyploid evolution. Whereas genetic and genomic attributes of polyploidization have received considerable attention, other crucial areas of polyploid evolution have received much less (e.g., ecology, pollination biology, physiology). The focus of this paper is not to review again recent discoveries, but to emphasize what we do not yet know about polyploidy, which despite all that has been learned about genome doubling is still an enormous amount. Our list is not meant to be comprehensive, but includes a range of topics that we have placed in several general categories, including mode of formation, ecological and physiological consequences, and genomic rules. Questions include: What is (are) the most frequent mechanism(s) of polyploidization? What factors promote/facilitate polyploidization? What factors favor autopolyploid vs. allopolyploid formation? Do multiple origins result in lineages with differing evolutionary trajectories and/or cryptic species? Our major goals are to stimulate discussion and promote further research.
20774037|Many central questions on speciation genetics such as the nature of genetic changes involved and the role of selection in speciation have been under prolonged and intense debate. The development of massively parallel sequencing and increased cooperation among ecological, population and molecular geneticists, offer the promise to find answers to these questions. However, there currently is evidence for the involvement of many different factors and processes in speciation, with their relative importance unresolved. Processes implicated in speciation include not only geographic isolation and structural change through small-effect mutations, but also regulatory mutations, copy number variation and chromosomal rearrangements, as well as scenarios of divergence-with-gene-flow and evolution through genetic conflict. In this review, I summarize current views and persistent limitations in speciation genetics, explore two promising research approaches in this field and end with an overview on current and expected progress in plant speciation genetics.
20774038|In addition to the classic allopatric model of speciation in which two lineages diverge through time, a population may "bud off" from an ancestral population and become adapted to a different habitat. The ancestral population (the progenitor or p species) remains largely unchanged in its original habitat while the population that budded off acquires novel characters and becomes the derivative (d) species. P-d species pairs are appropriate systems for studying plant speciation because they represent recent divergence, making it more feasible to identify the few differences between the taxa and to infer possible early-evolving barriers to gene flow. The evidence that has been used to designate species as p-d pairs is reviewed and evaluated. P-d species pairs are compared for several characters, with ecogeographic factors the only consistent difference between species pairs. Three genera in which p-d species pairs have been studied in some depth are used to illustrate both the advantages and challenges of studying the process of speciation. It is suggested that there are some advantages in focusing future studies on even earlier stages of divergence, in which speciation is not yet complete, and p and d populations can be identified. Efforts should focus on ever more refined genetic analyses of differences between populations, especially factors reducing effective gene flow between them.
20774039|Phylogenetic analyses using two fast evolving plastid markers (rps4, trnL-F) reveal the occurrence of the Austral-asiatic liverwort genus Lobatiriccardia in the Neotropics. Two new species, Lobatiriccardia oberwinkleri and L. verdoornioides are reported from Ecuador. Phylogenetic reconstructions support Lobatiriccardia and Aneura as monophyletic sister groups and do not place Verdoornia as the first branching Aneuracean taxon but rather sister to Aneura and Lobatiriccardia, which is consistent with mycothallus development in Aneuraceae. Subsequently, Aneuraceae, as treated here, include Aneura, Lobatiriccardia, Riccardia, and Verdoornia. Although high levels of genetic structure can be observed among members of the Aneura pinguis complex, current species delimitations are questionable, and detailed analyses of cryptic speciation and biogeographic patterns are needed to understand the evolution of Aneura, with particular attention paid to the non-photosynthetic species Aneura mirabilis. Ancestral state reconstructions suggest an evolutionary trend of female gametangia, and subsequently the sporophyte, moving from a central position on the dorsal side of the thallus (Verdoornia) to a marginal position between thallus lobes (Lobatiriccardia) to a more ventral (quasi latero-ventral) position under the thallus margin (Aneura).
20774040|A molecular phylogeny including c. 75% of all known species belonging to the closely related genera Anthemis and Cota (Compositae, Anthemideae) and based on nucleotide sequences from two plastid regions (psbA-trnH and trnC-petN spacers) and one nuclear marker (ITS) is presented. The molecular analyses were supplemented by a multivariate analysis of 25 micromorphological and anatomical characters. The results show incongruences among plastid and nuclear marker sets, which indicate that hybridisation may have played an important role in the evolution of this morphologically diverse plant group. However, molecular and morphological data both support a sister-group relationship between four perennial species (A. calcarea, A. fruticulosa, A. marschalliana, A. trotzkiana) and the main clades of Cota and Anthemis. We propose segregation of these from Anthemis as a new genus, Archanthemis. With the exclusion of these four taxa, both the nrDNA and the cpDNA datasets support the monophyly of Anthemis. Further molecular and morphological evidence is provided for the generic independence of the genus Cota. The traditional infrageneric classifications of Anthemis and Cota are not entirely supported by the phylogenetic analyses as a picture of intense reticulate evolution among the different lineages emerges.
20774041|Kohautia Cham. & Schltdl. belongs to the predominantly herbaceous Rubiaceae tribe Spermacoceae. Species of Kohautia can easily be distinguished from other Spermacoceae by their monomorphic short-styled flowers in which anthers and stigma are included in the corolla tube, with the stigma always positioned below the anthers. Mainly because of this unique floral morphology, Kohautia was considered to be a distinct genus. Molecular data (atpB-rbcL, petD, rps16, trnL-trnF, ETS, ITS) confirm that the genus is biphyletic. Two distantly related clades correspond to the subgenera Kohautia and Pachystigma Bremek. A similar type of floral organisation thus seems to have evolved twice independently, resulting in similar, but distantly related lineages. In order to translate the biphyletic nature of Kohautia into a formal classification, the two subgenera are recognized at generic level. A substitute name, Cordylostigma Groeninckx & Dessein is proposed for K. subg. Pachystigma because of the existence of Pachystigma Hochst. in the Rubiaceae tribe Vanguerieae. Floral, pollen and seed characters were studied to morphologically characterize Kohautia s.str. and Cordylostigma. By optimizing pollination syndromes and pollen characters onto the molecular phylogeny, we investigated pollination shifts and pollen evolution within the two genera. Detailed floral morphological studies show that the nectar guides in the psychophilous species of Kohautia s.str. and Cordylostigma evolved in different ways but result in the same visual effect.
20774042|We investigated the species and genome relationships among 82 Avena accessions representing thirteen diploid species (A and C genomes), six tetraploids (AB and AC genomes) and four hexaploids (ACD genome) to infer the evolutionary pathways in Avena using the plastid matK gene and the trnL-F region. The matK and trnL-F sequences pointed to the A-genome diploid species as maternal parents of the polyploid species. Furthermore, different A-genome diploid species might have served as the A genome donor of several different polyploid species. The probable ancestor of most hexaploid species, of the AC-genome tetraploids, and of the AB-genome species A. agadiriana was A. wiestii (As genome). The likely donor of the other three AB-genome tetraploids was A. hirtula (also As genome) and A. damascena (Ad genome) appears to be the A genome donor of the hexaploid A. fatua. The A genome origin of A. fatua differs from that for the other hexaploid Avena species, which is different from the common assumption that the hexaploid species evolved from a single hexaploid ancestor followed by gain or loss of domestication genes. Thus, several separate maternal lineages might be involved in different polyploid species.
20774043|The fungal order Ostropales is unique in Ascomycota for including both lichen-forming and non-lichenized species and species with optional nutritional strategies depending on substrate. To address the phylogenetic relationships within the order, we assembled a dataset of 78 ostropalean species, including all major clades and 23 taxa that are only optionally lichenized or non-lichenized. The analyses are based on sequences of the mtSSU and nuLSU rDNA and the protein-coding gene RPB2. A close relationship of Graphidaceae and Gomphillaceae is suggested with the latter possibly nested within Graphidaceae. Odontotremataceae is composed of two distantly related groups. Coenogoniaceae and Porinaceae are sister taxa, and their relation to Gyalectaceae is unresolved. Gyalecta is paraphyletic with Belonia and Pachyphiale nested within. A polyphyletic Belonia indicates that perithecioid ascomata evolved more than once in Gyalectaceae. The new family Sagiolechiaceae is proposed to accommodate Rhexophiale and Sagiolechia and Solorinellaceae is reinstated distinct from Gomphillaceae. Belonia and Pachyphiale are reduced to synonymy with Gyalecta. The distribution of phenotypical character states is discussed with selected character states mapped onto a phylogenetic tree. A special focus is given on lifestyles. Our phylogeny suggests that there is more plasticity in the evolution of life-styles in these fungi than was previously assumed.
20774044|Hypericum is a worldwide-distributed genus with almost 500 species, including the medically used, facultative apomictic species H. perforatum. It is one of the few large plant genera for which alpha taxonomy has been completed and most species have been described. To conduct a formal cladistic analysis of the genus, we coded 89 morphological characters for all described taxa and analyzed the data for the species using parsimony and Bayesian methods. The obtained trees indicate that Hypericum is monophyletic if the monotypic genus Santomasia is included, and that Lianthus is its sister. The arrangement of the remaining genera of Hypericaceae included in the analysis is in congruence with molecular phylogenies. Within Hypericum the cladistic analysis revealed a basal grade containing Mediterranean species and three big clades containing most of the diversity of the genus. In contrast to earlier assumptions, we found no indication for an African origin of Hypericum, but assume that the genus evolved in what today is the Mediterranean area. Our phylogenies indicate a shrubby habit to be the ancestral state within Hypericum from which species with tree-like and herbaceous habit evolved, and that apomixis originated at least three times independently within the genus.
20774045|During recent fieldwork activities conducted in order to complete the publication of the Flora of Gabon, new material was collected of two previously unknown Impatiens species. Molecular phylogenetic analyses and a detailed comparative morphological study confirmed the status of the newly collected material. Impatiens wilksiana Stvart, S.B. Janssens & Eb. Fisch. is characterized by a dense racemose inflorescence, rather small flowers, yellow petals and red sepals, whereas I. issembei S.B. Janssens, Stvart & Eb. Fisch. has few-flowered racemose inflorescences and larger flowers, which are entirely vividred. The divergence of I. issembei and I. wilksiana is estimated at 0.96 Ma ago, an age that corresponds with a shift towards increasingly variable drier conditions situated between 1.2 and 0.8 Ma ago. During this period, the once continuous ancestral population of I. issembei and I. wilksiana was probably fragmented into two sister populations restricted to the forest refuges in the Massif du Chaillu and the Monts de Cristal. Allopatric speciation in association with such refuges may have played a role in the origin and diversification of the present day African Impatiens.
20774046|Vuilleminia is a corticioid genus common in Europe whose species inhabit decaying and dead attached wood of angiosperms. To examine the circumscription of the genus and the phylogenetic relationships among its species, we analyzed nuclear ribosomal sequence data from the ITS region and the LSU gene with maximum parsimony and Bayesian methods and also studied morphological characters. Our results challenge the notion that spore size and host specificity are critically important factors in delimiting species of Vuilleminia. A taxonomic summary of the accepted species in Vuilleminia is provided. Vuilleminia species described from the South America and Africa are demonstrated to be distinct from those of the north temperate region. Australovuilleminia coccinea gen. & sp. nov. is proposed for the taxon previously reported as V. comedens from New Zealand. Punctulariopsis gen. nov. is proposed for V. subglobispora described from Argentina (= Punctulariopsis subglobispora) and V. obducens from Ethiopia (= Punctulariopsis obducens). Vuilleminia is shown to be a monophyletic genus, apparently north hemispheric, and currently comprises six species. Vuilleminia together with the closely related genera Cytidia and Australovuilleminia form a well-supported clade (Vuilleminia clade) and the family name Vuilleminiaceae is resurrected to recognize this clade. Vuilleminia quercina (= Corticium quercicola) is not closely related to the other Vuilleminia species and is instead nested in a completely different clade (Corticium clade). A new genus Marchandiopsis is erected for this taxon.
20774047|The taxonomic features of species of Panicum, previously classified in Panicum subg. Agrostoidea and Phanopyrum including sects. Megista, Tenera, Prionitia and Agrostoidea, are reviewed and compared with subg. Panicum and other taxa of Paniceae. All taxa, previously considered in these subgenera and sections, are now included in the new genera Stephostachys and Sorengia, which are based on morphological and molecular characters. Stephostachys includes one species, S. mertensii (Roth) Zuloaga & Morrone, ranging from Mexico to Argentina, while Sorengia comprises seven species, S. anceps (Michx.) Zuloaga & Morrone, S. caricoides (Nees ex Trin.) Zuloaga & Morrone, Sorengia longifolia (Torr.) Zuloaga & Morrone S. petersonii (Hitchc. & Ekman) Zuloaga & Morrone, S. prionitis (Nees) Zuloaga & Morrone, S. stenodes (Griseb.) Zuloaga & Morrone, and S. tenera (Beyr. ex Trin.) Zuloaga & Morrone, distributed from the United States to Bolivia and Brazil. Affinities of the new genera with other genera of Paniceae are discussed. Lectotypes are designated for Panicum caricoides var. glabriusculum Dll, P. caricoides var. pilosum Dll, P. prionitis Nees, P. prionitis var. varium Kuntze, and P. stenodes Griseb.
20774048|Greeniopsis Merr. is a small genus of Rubiaceae endemic to the Philippines. Previously, no molecular data have been available for Greeniopsis and its taxonomic position has remained controversial. Based on morphology, the genus was tentatively included in the tribe Aleisanthieae (Ixoroideae) along with the Southeast Asian genera Aleisanthia and Aleisanthiopsis. To determine the taxonomic position of Greeniopsis and evaluate the monophyly of the genus, sequences of the rps16 and trnT-F regions of cpDNA of all seven Greeniopsis species were generated. Parsimony and Bayesian analyses of the combined plastid dataset strongly support the inclusion of Greeniopsis in Aleisanthieae as well as its monophyly. Woolly hairs on the abaxial leaf surface occur in only one Greeniopsis species and can no longer be regarded a synapomorphy of the tribe. The generic status of Aleisanthia, Aleisanthiopsis, and Greeniopsis is maintained. A revision of Greeniopsis, including a key to species, descriptions, distribution maps, and illustrations, is provided.
20774049|We conclude that the arguments put forward by Jrgensen in his response to our recent proposal to abandon botanical Latin as the mandatory language in which to provide a description or diagnosis when a new species is described, in fact serve to confirm that this requirement must now be removed from the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature.
20774050|Smith & al. (2010) have suggested that the apportionment of institutional votes for the Nomenclature Section of the International Botanical Congress based upon taxonomic activity represents a "colonial legacy" that disadvantages developing nations, and that institutional votes should instead be distributed based at least in part upon a country's human population and the size of its flora. While we agree that increasing participation by developing-country taxonomists is an important goal, we believe that Smith & al. fail to support their claim that the current practice of plant nomenclature is harmful to developing nations. No evidence has been offered of regional biases regarding proposals to change the wording of the Code, which represent the vast majority of the votes taken at any Nomenclature Section, nor has the current process of apportionment of institutional votes been shown to be biased. The reform measures proposed by Smith & al. would, as we show, introduce explicit discrimination based on nationality into the International code of botanical nomenclature, undermining the international cooperation among taxonomists that is necessary for the smooth functioning of a universally accepted system of nomenclature. Rather than making hasty and perhaps harmful changes to the current means of voting, we suggest that the international taxonomic community should consider carefully what measures will best facilitate participation without creating new sources of injustice.
20774051|Neotypes are proposed for the names of ten species of American plants that Linnaeus based in whole or in part on descriptions in Loefling's Iter Hispanicum: Allionia incarnata, Allionia violacea, Ayenia tomentosa, Byttneria scabra, Krameria ixine, Lecythis ollaria, Moniera trifolia, Viola arborea, Viola calceolaria, and Viola oppositifolia. Lectotypes are proposed for the names of six species of American plants that Linnaeus based in whole or in part on descriptions in the same work: Ayenia magna, Cecropia peltata, Ellisia acuta, Jussiaea pubescens, Loranthus occidentalis, and Spermacoce strigosa. A neotype also is proposed for a Jacquin name, Hybanthus havanensis, which Linnaeus renamed as Viola hybanthus. We also argue that Laetia americana is neotypified by the type applied to the illegitimate name Laetia apetala.
20774052|The identity of Angraecum gracile Thouars and its nomenclatural history are clarified. Although most recently assigned to Chamaeangis, the fragmentary type is best placed in Angraecum, as indicated by the drawing and the table accompanying Thouars's description. To date this Mauritian endemic is known only from the type; three specimens previously associated with it by Finet from the Comoro Islands and La Runion belong instead to Angraecopsis trifurca (Rchb. f.) Schltr.
20774054|The type specimens of the names of many taxa were destroyed in the bombing of the Berlin herbarium (B) in March 1943. The taxonomy of African Solanum has been dogged for many years with the absence of type specimens for names published in the 1920s by the German botanist Georg Bitter, many of which were in Berlin and for which duplicates have not been found despite extensive searches by several generations of botanists. Recent examination of the collections in GOET, where Bitter spent the last few years of his life as director, has revealed a rich source of material with which to address typification problems in African Solanum. This consists of delicate tracings of herbarium specimens from B that are no longer extant, often accompanied by small fragments removed from the original specimens. Here we use this collection and other extant material to typify 37 names in African Solanum (S. acutilobatum Dammer, S. alloiophyllum Dammer, S. alloiophyllum Dammer subsp. machisuguense Bitter, S. darassumense Dammer, S. eickii Dammer, S. filicaule Dammer, S. floccosistellatum Bitter, S. gilo Raddi var. ellipsoideum Bitter, S. gilo Raddi var. erectifructum Bitter, S. gilo Raddi subsp. megalacanthum Bitter, S. glochidiatum Dammer, S. indicum L. subsp. ambifarium Bitter, S. kitivuense Dammer, S. lachneion Dammer, S. lamprocarpum Bitter, S. longestamineum Dammer, S. magdalenae Dammer, S. maranguense Bitter, S. merkeri Dammer var. endastrophorum Bitter, S. merkeri Dammer subsp. militans Bitter, S. merkeri Dammer var. ruandense Bitter, S. monotanthum Dammer, S. multiglandulosum Bitter, S. neumannii Dammer, S. nigriviolaceum Bitter, S. nossibeense Vatke var. elongatius Bitter, S. poggei Dammer, S. scheffleri Dammer, S. setaceum Dammer, S. setaceum Dammer var. irakuanum Bitter, S. stipitatostellatum Dammer, S. tabacicolor Dammer, S. taitense Vatke, S. tanganikense Bitter, S. urosepalum Dammer, S. usaramense Dammer, S. verbascifrons Bitter); 27 of these were thought to lack types prior to this study.
41059864|The precise generic delimitation of Aliella and Phagnalon and their tribal affinities are at present unresolved. The main goals of our study were to verify the monophyly of these two genera and to determine their closest affinity group within Gnaphalieae. We analysed sequences of the trnL intron and trnL-trnF spacer of Gnaphalieae and other Compositae tribes, in order to elucidate the tribal position of Aliella, Macowania,, Phagnalon and Philyrophyllum. In addition, we analysed ribosomal nrDNA together with the ycf3-trnS and trnT-trnL spacers of cpDNA to elucidate the relationships within Aliella and Phagnalon. The genera Anisothrix, Athrixia and Pentatrichia are closely related to Aliella and Phagnalon. Aliella, Macowania and Phagnalon are nested within the "Relhania clade", and the subtribal affinities of Philyrophyllum lie within the "crown radiation clade". The monophyly of Aliella and Phagnalon is not supported statistically and Aliella is paraphylethic in most of the analyses. The resulting phylogeny suggests an African origin for Aliella and Phagnalon and identifies three main clades in Phagnalon, the Irano-Turanian clade, the Mediterranean-Macaronesian clade and the Yemenite-Ethiopian clade. Some endemics to Yemen and Ethiopia are resolved in the Mediterranean-Macaronesian clade, providing new evidence of phytogeographical links between Macaronesia, Eastern Africa and Southern Arabia. Incongruence between the chloroplast and nuclear molecular data and the lack of resolution in some clades may indicate that hybridization could have played an important role in the evolution and diversification of Phagnalon and Aliella.
41059865|The Filago group (Asteraceae, Gnaphalieae) comprises eleven genera, mainly distributed in Eurasia, northern Africa and northern America: Ancistrocarphus, Bombycilaena, Chamaepus, Cymbolaena, Evacidium, Evax, Filago, Logfia, Micropus, Psilocarphus and Stylocline. The main morphological character that defines the group is that the receptacular paleae subtend, and more or less enclose, the female florets. The aims of this work are, with the use of three chloroplast DNA regions (rpl32-trnL intergenic spacer, trnL intron, and trnL-trnF intergenic spacer) and two nuclear DNA regions (ITS, ETS), to test whether the Filago group is monophyletic; to place its members within Gnaphalieae using a broad sampling of the tribe; and to investigate in detail the phylogenetic relationships among the Old World members of the Filago group and provide some new insight into the generic circumscription and infrageneric classification based on natural entities. Our results do not show statistical support for a monophyletic Filago group. The traditional generic circumscription of most of the genera, as well as the traditional infrageneric classification of the genus Filago, do not correlate with the inferred phylogenetic relationships. A monophyletic circumscription of Filago and a new subgeneric treatment for this genus are proposed, this involving description of a new subgenus (Filago subg. Crocidion Andres-Sanchez & Galbany, subg. nov.) and four new combinations (Filago subg. Pseudevax (DC.) Andrs-Snchez & Galbany, comb, et stat. nov.; Filago discolor (DC.) Andrs-Snchez & Galbany, comb, nov.; Filago gaditana (Pau) Andrs-Snchez & Galbany, comb, et stat. nov. and Filago grifflthii (A. Gray) Andrs-Snchez & Galbany, comb. nov.). The genera Cymbolaena, Evacidium and Evax are synonymised under Filago. Several incongruences found between chloroplast and nuclear DNA sequence analyses, as well as a notable degree of intraspecific sequence variation in all regions sequenced are documented and discussed.
41059866|The northern temperate genus Pyrola L. is the largest and arguably the most taxonomically complex element in the tribe Pyroleae (Ericaceae). Here we present a molecular phylogenetic study with extensive sampling comprising 26 ingroup and 7 closely related taxa. The results, based on parsimony and Bayesian analyses of nuclear (ITS) and chloroplast (atpB-rbcL, trnS-trnG, trnL-trnF) DNA sequences, add substantially to our understanding of relationships within this diverse group and call for taxonomic changes. Pyrola is confirmed as a monophyletic group with two redefined sections and six series: P. sect Pyrola (P. sen Pyrola, ser. Ellipticae and ser. Rugosae) and P. sect. Scotophylla (P. ser. Japonicae, ser. Scotophyllae and ser. Chloranthae). Members of each respective section and series share similar morphological traits and/or geographical distributions. For the potential hybrids P. media and P. faurieana, the maternal donor was identified by their close affinity to P. minor in the chloroplast trees whereas the paternal donor remained unclear.
41059867|The subtribe Gentianinae comprises ca.425 species, most of them within the well-studied genus Gentiana and mainly distributed over the Eurasian continent. Phylogenetic relationships between Gentiana and its closest relatives, the climbing gentians (Crawfurdia, Tripterospermum) and the new genus Metagentiana, remain unclear. All three genera were recently found to be polyphyletic, possibly because of poor sampling of Tripterospermum and Crawfurdia. Highest diversity of Gentianinae occurs in the western Himalaya, but the absence of uncontroversial fossil evidence limits our understanding of its biogeography. In the present study, we generated ITS and atpB-rbcL sequences for 19 species of Tripterospermum, 9 of Crawfurdia and 11 of Metagentiana, together representing about 60 percent of the species diversity of these genera. Our results show that only Metagentiana is polyphyletic and divided into three monophyletic entities. No unambiguous synapomorphies were associated with the three Metagentiana entities. Different combinations of three approximate calibration points were used to generate three divergence time estimation scenarios. Although dating hypotheses were mostly inconsistent, they concurred in associating radiation of Gentiana to an orogenic phase of the Himalaya between 15 and 10 million years ago. Our study illustrates the conceptual difficulties in addressing the time frame of diversification in a group lacking sufficient fossil number and quality.
41059868|Calathodes and Megaleranthis are two eastern Asian endemic genera of Ranunculaceae with controversial tribal position and/or taxonomic status. In this study, we used matK sequences to determine the tribal position of Calathodes and Megaleranthis within the family, and three molecular loci (matK, trnL-F, ITS) and morphological data to further clarify their phylogenetic relationships and taxonomic status. All analyses show that Calathodes and Megaleranthis belong in the tribe Adonideae, and that Calathodes is monophyletic and closely related to Trollius. The latter two genera share rhizomes not well developed and pollen grains with striate exine ornamentation, but markedly differ in petals, follicles, receptacles, pollen grains, and chromosomes. Trollius contains two major clades with different geographical distributions. Megaleranthis is embedded in clade I and sister to Trollius macropetalus, with which it shares fruits with long beaks and a 7 bp deletion in the trnL-F dateset. Adonideae are redelimited as consisting of three genera, Adonis, Calathodes and Trollius. Morphological synapomorphies for the tribe are lacking.
41059869|Generic delimitation of Cyathocalyx and Drepananthus has been controversial, with some authors recognizing them as distinct genera, and others recognizing a more broadly defined Cyathocalyx, inclusive of Drepananthus. Some doubt also exists regarding the relationships between these taxa and Cananga. Molecular phylogenetic analyses are presented based on combined psbA-trnH spacer, trnL-F, matK and rbcL sequences. Results indicate that Cananga, Cyathocalyx s.str. and Drep ananthus form three generally well-supported clades, although with inadequate resolution of relationships among the three clades. Morphological variation is re-evaluated, and the narrower delimitation of Cyathocalyx proposed, necessitating 21 new nomenclatural combinations following the recognition of Drepananthus as a distinct genus. Divergence times are estimated using an uncorrelated lognormal distributed (UCLD) relaxed molecular clock. Historical biogeographical analysis suggests that the ambavioid lineage originated in Africa, with subsequent dispersal into Asia. Alternative hypotheses for this dispersal, involving rafting on the Indian tectonic plate versus migration via the extensive boreotropical forests associated with the Eocene thermal maximum, are evaluated, and the latter route identified as the most consistent with the divergence age estimates and the geological and palaeoclimatic data.
41059870|Parmelioid lichens are a diverse and ubiquitous group of foliose lichens. Generic delimitation in parmelioid lichens has been in a state of flux since the late 1960s with the segregation of the large, heterogeneous genus Parmelia into numerous smaller genera. Recent molecular phylogenetic studies have demonstrated that some of these new genera were monophyletic, some were not, and others, previously believed to be unrelated, fell within single monophyletic groups, indicating the need for a revision of the generic delimitations. This study aims to give an overview of current knowledge of the major clades of all parmelioid lichens. For this, we assembled a dataset of 762 specimens, including 31 of 33 currently accepted parmelioid genera (and 63 of 84 accepted genera of Parmeliaceae). We performed maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses of combined datasets including two, three and four loci. Based on these phylogenies and the correlation of morphological and chemical characters that characterize monophyletic groups, we accept 27 genera within nine main clades. We re-circumscribe several genera and reduce Parmelaria to synonymy with Parmotrema. Emodomelanelia Divakar & A. Crespo is described as a new genus (type: E. masonii). Nipponoparmelia (Kurok.) K.H. Moon, Y. Ohmura & Kashiw. ex A. Crespo & al. is elevated to generic rank and 15 new combinations are proposed (in the genera Flavoparmelia, Parmotrema, Myelochroa, Melanelixia and Nipponoparmelia). A short discussion of the accepted genera is provided and remaining challenges and areas requiring additional taxon sampling are identified.
41059871|An exceptionally wide range of systematic data has been accumulated on subtribe Orchidinae, which dominates the European orchid flora. Despite (or perhaps because of) this wealth of information, delimitation of genera within the subtribe continues to prompt extensive debate among taxonomists. Here, we use the controversial genus Orchis s.l. as a case-study to explore the broader issues that surround the definition and circumscription of genera, and suggest a new approach to selecting among competing formal classifications that focuses on the biological cohesion of the resulting taxa. Levels of postzygotic reproductive isolation, assessed as differential embryo mortality through extensive artificial crosses between species, are compared with three taxonomic treatments: a pre-cladistic morphological classification permitting polyphyly; a cladistic classification generated by applying monophyly to Internal Transcribed Spacer sequences; and a 'post-cladistic' classification that aimed to compromise between morphological and molecular differences and permitted paraphyly. The monophyletic cladistic classification is by far the most consistent with levels of postzygotic isolation through embryo mortality. Reproductive isolation, sequence divergence and morphological similarity can all usefully be quantitatively compared with formal classifications, though floral morphology in orchids offers a high risk of rapid co-evolutionary divergence with pollinator guilds, often generating spurious monospecific 'genera'. Best practice in taxonomy reflects reciprocal illumination between key biological datasets and formal classifications, pursued in a rigorous framework of precise definitions of taxa and wellfounded evolutionary-phylogenetic concepts.
41059872|The "Sporobolus aeneus complex" constitutes a morphologically well-defined group of species with lax, exerted, pyramidal panicles with verticillate branches, and comprises 14 species and six infraspeciflc taxa in southern South America (eastern Bolivia, eastern Paraguay, Uruguay, southern Brazil, northeastern Argentina). Species delimitation in the complex remains unresolved. To clarify the taxonomy of the group, multivariate analyses of qualitative and quantitative characters from herbaria specimens were performed. We applied the phylogenetic species concept and we used a modified "population aggregation analysis." Five species (S. aeneus, S. cubensis, S. linearifolius, S. multinodis, S. recurvatus) are recognized by unique combinations of qualitative character states, and three varieties based on significant mean value differences of quantitative characters. We conclude that leaf blade pilosity, widely used as a diagnostic character in the complex, is affected by external conditions like fire or blade age and is taxonomically unreliable. Two new cominations, Sporobolus aeneus var. angustifolia (Doll) S. Denham & Aliscioni and S. aeneus var. eximius (Nees ex Trin.) S. Denham & Aliscioni are made. Vilfa acuminata Trin. and Vilfa eximia Nees ex Trin. are lectotypified.
41059873|The Cuscuta umbellata complex is one of the 15 major clades recently circumscribed in C. subg. Grammica. Most of its members occur in North America and the Caribbean (C. desmouliniana, C. lacerata, C. leptantha, C. liliputana, C. odontolepis, C. polyanthemos, C. tuberculata, C. umbellata), but three species (C. acuta, C. membranacea, C. umbellata) grow in South America, and one (C. hyalina) is found as a native species in India, Pakistan and Eastern to South Africa. Basic morphology, scanning electron microscopy and sequence data from the nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and the plastid trnL-F region were used to reconstruct the phylogeny, gain a better understanding of the evolutionary history, and determine species boundaries. Our results show that in its currently accepted delimitation C. umbellata is polyphyletic. Discordances between phylogenies derived from plastid and nuclear data strongly suggest that at least four independent hybridization events have occurred in the evolution of this species group, rendering relationships among its members more complex than previously thought. One of these reticulation events involves C. umbellata var. reflexa, a taxon that has been considered synonymous to C. umbellata var. umbellata in the last decades. This hybrid is morphologically intermediate but distinct from its putative parents, C. odontolepis or C. acuta on the maternal side, and C. umbellata (var. umbellata) on the paternal side, which supports its treatment as a new species, C. legitima. Cuscuta umbellata is further redefined to exclude C. umbellata var. dubia, which is merged into C. desmouliniana. A new classification is provided, together with an identification key, descriptions, illustrations, and geographical distributions for the twelve species of the clade.
41059874|The Caribbean Island Biodiversity Hotspot is the largest insular system of the New World and a priority for biodiversity conservation worldwide. The tribe Adelieae (Euphorbiaceae) has over 35 species endemic to this hotspot, representing a prime example of speciation in the West Indies and involving taxa from Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the Bahamas. These species form a monophyletic group and have traditionally been accommodated in two endemic genera, Lasiocroton and Leucocroton. A study based on scanning electron microscopy of pollen, macromorphology, and molecular analysis was conducted to reveal generic relationships within this group. Phylogenies were based on nucleotide sequences of the nrlTS region and the non-coding cpDNA spacers psbM-trnD and ycf6-pcbM. Three major monophyletic assemblages were revealed; one of them is restricted to Hispaniola and is accommodated in a new genus, Garciadelia, with four species. The new genus is sister to a clade comprising two monophyletic groups, one including all species of Leucocroton and restricted to serpentine soils of Cuba, and a second including the species of Lasiocroton, occurring in Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the Bahamas. Morphological, biogeographical, and ecological data provided additional support for each of these three monophyletic assemblages. Two new combinations (Lasiocroton microphyllus from Cuba, Garciadelia leprosa from Hispaniola) are made and four new species are described (Lasiocroton gutierrezii from Cuba, and Garciadelia abbottii, G. castilloae, and G. mejiae from Hispaniola).
41059875|Phialiphora Groeninckx is described as a new herbaceous genus of Rubiaceae, endemic to NW Madagascar. The genus belongs to the predominantly herbaceous tribe Spermacoceae, and comprises two species: P. bevazahensis Groeninckx and P. capitulata Groeninckx. Phialiphora is unique within Spermacoceae in having heart-shaped placentas distally attached to the septum with a stalk. The generic name refers to the involucrate head-like inflorescences. Molecular data, based on atpB-rbcL, petD, rpsl6, and trnL-trnF sequences, demonstrate that Phialiphora belongs to the Hedyotis-Oldenlandia complex of the tribe Spermacoceae. The genus shares a common ancestor with the Madagascan endemics Astiella Jovet, Thamnoldenlandia Groeninckx and Amphistemon Groeninckx. Our study supports the hypothesis that the current diversity of Spermacoceae on Madagascar is the result of several independent colonisation events since the Eocene, most likely by long-distance dispersal from the African continent. A key to the genera of Spermacoceae on Madagascar is provided.
41059876|Computational workflow environments are an active area of computer science and informatics research; they promise to be effective for automating biological information processing for increasing research efficiency and impact. In this project, semi-automated data processing workflows were developed to test the efficiency of computerizing information contained in herbarium plant specimen labels. Our test sample consisted of Mexican and Central American plant specimens held in the University of Michigan Herbarium (MICH). The initial data acquisition process consisted of two parts: (1) the capture of digital images of specimen labels and of full-specimen herbarium sheets, and (2) creation of a minimal field database, or "pre-catalog", of records that contain only information necessary to uniquely identify specimens. For entering "pre-catalog" data, two methods were tested: key-stroking the information (a) from the specimen labels directly, or (b) from digital images of specimen labels. In a second step, locality and latitude/longitude data fields were filled in if the values were present on the labels or images. If values were not available, geo-coordinates were assigned based on further analysis of the descriptive locality information on the label. Time and effort for the various steps were measured and recorded. Our analysis demonstrates a clear efficiency benefit of articulating a biological specimen data acquisition workflow into discrete steps, which in turn could be individually optimized. First, we separated the step of capturing data from the specimen from most keystroke data entry tasks. We did this by capturing a digital image of the specimen for the first step, and also by limiting initial key-stroking of data to create only a minimal "pre-catalog" database for the latter tasks. By doing this, specimen handling logistics were streamlined to minimize staff time and cost. Second, by then obtaining most of the specimen data from the label images, the more intellectually challenging task of label data interpretation could be moved electronically out of the herbarium to the location of more highly trained specialists for greater efficiency and accuracy. This project used experts in the plants' country of origin, Mexico, to verify localities, geography, and to derive geo-coordinates. Third, with careful choice of data fields for the "pre-catalog" database, specimen image files linked to the minimal tracking records could be sorted by collector and date of collection to minimize key-stroking of redundant data in a continuous series of labels, resulting in improved data entry efficiency and data quality.
41059877|Several studies of host-parasite evolution have used gene trees developed for each partner as a means to detect the influence of one on the evolution of the other, a process known as cophylogeny. We now extend this concept and present a process to test whether two genes or gene regions within the same species have coevolved in order to assess their further utility in the same phylogenetic analysis. The process entails well-established methods; firstly based upon a given set of sequence data, inference of best-fit evolutionary models and associated parameters through to gene tree building by maximum likelihood. This is followed by a "ParaFit" analysis of pairwise combination of genes or gene regions. The pairwise combinations that pass the test of cophylogeny may then be horizontally concatenated for phylogenetic inference of the set of taxa under study. The complete mathematical properties of this process presently remain unexplored; however, we demonstrate the utility of such an analysis prior to phylogenetic inference using examples from available datasets.
41059878|The Special Committee on Electronic Publication was re-established at the XVII International Botanical Congress (IBC) in Vienna in 2005, with the mandate to consider on the issues relating to the electronic publication of nomenclatural novelties and to report to the XVIII IBC in Melbourne in 2011. With the global push to inventory biodiversity and to develop information systems to disseminate data, issues surrounding speed of publication, copyright and licensing, and permanence and accessibility of information have surfaced. Electronic publication is central to these issues, and the insistence of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (Code) on distribution of printed matter for effective publication is seen by many as a hindrance to progress. Against this backdrop, the Committee conducted extensive negotiations and discussions on a wide range of issues on electronic publication, which are here summarized in the Committee's report. The Committee unanimously supports the extension of effective publication to electronic publication, but in a well-regulated way that will establish the basis for long-term archiving and discovery. The Committee has put forward a set of eleven proposals (Special Committee on Electronic Publication, 2010) to amend the Code to permit electronic publications to be considered effectively published under specified conditions on or after 1 January 2013. It is proposed that electronic material will be effectively published only when distributed in Portable Document Format (PDF) in an online serial publication with an International Standard Serial Number (ISSN). An additional proposal extends this to PDF with an International Standard Book Number (ISBN). Further proposals strengthen this by forbidding post-publication alteration and by discounting preliminary versions as not effectively published. The current method for establishing the date of effective publication is amended to account for electronic material. These changes to the Articles of the Code are supported by a set of Recommendations for best practice for electronic publication of nomenclatural novelties, covering aspects of archiving and immutability, dissemination of data, and clear designation of versions as preliminary or final. This report provides the supporting documentation for the set of proposals that are also published in this issue. It is necessary that the two be read alongside each other.
41059879|Historically, nonlichenized fungi in two phyla, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, with pleomorphic life cycles may have more than one acceptable legitimate name with priority given to names typified by teleomorphs. This idea has been challenged amidst considerable prolonged debate. An intermediate step towards normalized nomenclature was made in Vienna through the introduction of teleomorph epitypes. A Special Committee was formed to provide guidance on another proposal to prohibit future dual nomenclature and to review the need for Article 59. Committee membership fluctuated between ten and twelve individuals whose opinions were divided over three options: (1) delete Article 59, (2) remove the option for epitypification, or (3) revise the Article further. The Committee reached an impasse and as a body could not recommend acceptance or rejection of any particular proposal. A set of proposals discussed by the Committee is made separately and independently.
41059881|The taxonomic and nomenclatural histories of Viola elatior Fr. (1828), V. pumila Chaix (1785) and V. stagnina Kit. ex Schult. (1814) in central and western Europe are discussed. The names V. stagnina and V. elatior are lectotypifled with specimens corresponding to the current use of these names. The neglected lectotypification in 1988 of V. montana L. (1753) with a specimen referable to V. elatior is briefly reviewed. The name V. persicifolia Schreb. (1771), used in some floras instead of V. stagnina, is analysed in detail, and we conclude that this name should be interpreted as referring also to V. elatior. In addition the types of V. hornemanniana Schult. (1819) and V. stipulacea Hartm. (1820) are conspecific with V. elatior. The use of V. persicifolia and V. montana, representing earlier legitimate names for the species widely known as V elatior, has been notoriously confused for two centuries, and we herein recommend these two names for rejection in order to assure nomenclatural clarity and stability. For similar reasons, we recommend conservation of V. elatior against V. hornemanniana and V. stipulacea.
41059882|A lectotype and an epitype for Ficus racemosa L., the name for the species commonly known as "Clustered Fig", are proposed. The name was apparently based primarily on a plate in Rheede's Hortus Malabaricus labelled "Atty-Alu", a Malayalam dialect name for the plant figured. However, as the plate shows ambiguity by portraying a branch having figs in simple or true racemes, whereas the accompanying text describes the infructescences as panicled, an epitype is designated here to fix the application of this name in accordance with its current usage.
41059883|The morphological diversity and the presence of several convergent evolutionary lineages in the Cypereae tribe (Cyperaceae) have given rise to various conflicting classifications. These conflicts do not only arise in the delimitation of genera and their subdivisions, but also in the use of similar subdivisional names for different species groups and different names for similar species groups. This has resulted in the publication of approximately 350 names of genera and subdivisions of genera to accommodate the ca. 950 species in Cyperus and its segregate genera. This complex nomenclature has led to an accumulation of errors in the assessment of valid publication, priority and legitimacy, and in typification in almost all existing taxonomic treatments for the group. Renewed interest in the phylogeny and taxonomy of Cypereae reveals the need to evaluate the nomenclature of generic names and names of subdivisions of genera. In this paper, the first in a series of four papers, we present a survey of all generic names described in the Cyperus clade, designate types where needed, and evaluate priority and legitimacy.
41059818|The genus Hoya includes over 200 species with a geographic distribution covering all eight currently recognised biodiversity hotspots in the Indomalesian-Australasian region. Despite the great horticultural interest in Hoya, which includes some of the most commonly cultivated ornamental plants, very little is known about their evolution and a phylogenetic classification for the genus is lacking. Here we explore the phylogeny of 81 species of Hoya and close relatives by adding DNA sequences of the chloroplast matK gene and the psbA-trnH intergenic spacer to an existing molecular dataset consisting of nuclear ITS sequences and chloroplast sequences of the trnL region and the atpB-rbcL spacer. The topology obtained confirms previously identified clades in Hoya and resolves the phylogenetic relationships among a greater number of species. The phylogenetic position of Eriostemma, a section that is well defined by morphological characters, remains unresolved. However, Clemensiella mariae is here shown for the first time to be part of Hoya and sister to sect. Eriostemma, pointing to the urgent need of intrageneric revisions in the tribe Marsdenieae. At least two additional sections, Hoya and Otostemma, do not reflect phylogenetic relationships and should not be retained in taxonomic revisions of the genus.
41059819|Soroseris, Stebbinsia, and Syncalathium are three genera of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) with restricted distributions on high screes of the Tibetan Plateau. We present a molecular analysis to test the monophyly of the genera, evaluate the phylogenetic relationships and construct their biogeographic diversification history. Nuclear ITS and plastid trnL-F and psbA-trnH fragments were analyzed with parsimony, Bayesian inference, and relaxed Bayesian dating for all species of Soroseris, Stebbinsia, and Syncalathium. Stebbinsia is part of a polytomy with several lineages of Soroseris. Syncalathium is biphyletic with Syn. souliei placed within subtribe Lactucinae and the remaining species close to the Soroseris-Stebbinsia clade within subtribe Crepidinae. Bayesian dating based on ITS sequences and using four fossil calibrations suggests that the stem and crown ages of the Soroseris-Stebbinsia clade and the two groups of Syncalathium are between 8.44 and 1.56 million years. Stebbinsia should be treated as a section of Soroseris and Syncalathium souliei should be excluded from Syncalathium and either placed in Lactuca s.l. or established as a new genus in Lactucinae. The remaining species are to be treated as Syncalathium s.str. in Crepidinae. The diversification of these groups in the Tibetan Plateau is of relatively young age, and can be explained by rapid diversification and radiation of the Soroseris-Stebbinsia clade, allopatric speciation within Syncalathium s.str. and convergent evolution of Syncalathium s.str. and Syn. souliei. The speciation events correlated with climatic change and fragmentation of scree habitats during the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau. Possible migration routes in Syncalathium s.str. from the northeast to the central and southern part of the Tibetan Plateau are suggested.
41059820|Phylogenetic relationships among the six Iris subgenera were reconstructed based on chloroplast sequence data using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods. Previous studies indicated that the current subgeneric classification based on an intuitive interpretation of morphology was not concordant with evolution in Iris. This study more than doubled the number of taxa sampled and increased the number of molecular markers providing a more robust assessment of phylogeny. Iris subg. Nepalensis and subg. Xiphium were resolved as monophyletic, while subg. Hermodactyloides, subg. Limniris, subg. Iris and subg. Scorpiris were not. The three monotypic genera, Belamcanda, Pardanthopsis and Hermodactylus, recognized by some workers were resolved within Iris with strong support. The three bulbous subgenera, sometimes recognized as distinct genera, were resolved within Iris. A preliminary subgeneric classification is presented.
41059821|Recent phylogenetic analyses indicated that the backbone phylogeny of the pleurocarpous moss family Neckeraceae falls into three distinct clades. Here the detailed composition and phylogenetic relationships of the two major clades (the Neckera clade and the Thamnobryum clade) are analysed. The phylogenetic analyses, based on sequence data from the plastid rpll6 intron and the rps4-trnT-trnL-trnF cluster as well as the nuclear ITS1 and 2, retained this tripartition and revealed a strong biogeographic pattern, especially inside the Neckera clade. In addition, several morphological characters that have been held as unique and characteristic to a certain group of mosses and therefore valuable in taxonomic classification, were shown to be highly homoplastic and subjected to convergent evolution. Consequently, the circumscriptions of Leptodon and Thamnobryum are amended, the new genera Exsertotheca, Echinodiopsis and Thamnomalia (each with two species), and Alleniella (with ten species) are formally described and several implied nomenclatural changes are proposed, including synonymisation ofAlsia with Neckera and Cryptoleptodon with Leptodon.
41059822|Camphorosmeae constitute a species-rich tribe of Chenopodiaceae-Camphorosmoideae that consists mostly of subshrubs and annuals, distributed in steppes and semi-deserts of Australia, Eurasia, North Africa, southern Africa and North America. We study (1) the relationships of Camphorosmeae to major lineages of the closely related Salsoloideae and (2) the diversification of the tribe with focus on the non-Australian members using sequence variation of five different markers (rbcL gene, ndhF gene, atpB-rbcL spacer, psbB-psbH spacer, ITS) and morphological characters. The cpDNA analyses revealed six early-branching lineages in Camphorosmoideae/Salsoloideae (Camphorosmeae, Salsoleae s.str., Caroxyloneae, Salsola kali clade, Nanophyton clade, Salsola genistoides clade) and supported partly (ndhF and atpB-rbcL spacer) the sister-group relationship of Camphorosmeae and all Salsolean clades. The distinctness of Camphorosmeae and Salsoleae s.l. is further supported by seed, stigma and pollen morphology. Molecular clock estimates point to an earlier radiation in Salsoleae s.l. (Early to Middle Oligocene) than in Camphorosmeae (Early Miocene). In Salsoleae s.l. early radiation might have been enhanced by multiple evolution of C-photosynthesis which facilitated the spread into drier habitats of Eurasia. In Camphorosmeae, C-photosynthesis likely evolved two times, probably in the Middle Miocene. During the Miocene Camphorosmeae spread from Eurasia to Australia, North America and at least two times to South Africa. Only the Australian lineage diversified, the others remained species-poor. The molecular trees congruently resolve three major clades of unclear relationship within Camphorosmeae, Chenolea clade (five widely disjunct and morphologically divergent C-species, possibly remnants of old lineages), Sclerolaena clade (ca. 150 C-species from Central Asia [3 spp.] and Australia [147 spp.], probably the results of a rapid radiation during the Pliocene) and BassialCamphorosma clade (ca. 23 C-species and one C/C-intermediate which are widely distributed in Eurasia and southern Africa). The phylogenies show the artificial state of the current generic and subtribal classifications of Eurasian, North American and South African Camphorosmeae. All non-monotypic genera except Camphorosma and Neokochia were found to be polyphyletic. A revised classification of the tribe is proposed including reinstatement of the newly defined subfamily Camphorosmoideae, description of the new genera Spirobassia (1 sp.), Eokochia (1 sp.), Grubovia (3 spp.) and Sedobassia (1 sp.), and several new combinations and synonymizations.
41059823|Systematic and biogeographic relationships of mainly European and North American taxa of the moss genus Leucodon subg. Leucodon are inferred by phylogenetic reconstructions and haplotype analyses, based on sequence data from three plastid regions and nrITS. The two Macaronesian endemic species L. canariensis and L. treleasei are clearly separated from each other and from L. sciuroides, which is widespread in Eurasia including Macaronesia. A well-supported sister-group relationship with the American species L. curvirostris and L. julaceus indicates a New World ancestor of L. treleasei, which is probably a neoendemic species that colonized the Macaronesian islands after (recent) dispersal. The position of L. canariensis sister to the clade of L. treleasei and the American species is less well-supported, leaving its evolutionary history ambiguous. The Eastern North American L. andrewsianus is neither molecularly nor morphologically unambiguously distinguishable from L. sciuroides. Synonymisation of L. andrewsianus with L. sciuroides solves the long-debated question whether the latter species occurs in North America, and results in a Holarctic instead of Palaearctic distribution pattern of L. sciuroides. The Afromontane L. dracaenae cannot be clearly separated from L. sciuroides as well, whereas the Eastern Mediterranean to Central Asian L. immersus differs from L. sciuroides by few substitutions and indels as well as morphologically by the short seta and immersed capsule. Further analyses are necessary before taxonomic conclusions should be inferred for L. dracaenae and L. immersus. Intraspecific diversity in L. sciuroides does not support recognition of the mainly Mediterranean var. morensis. Instead, a basic separation of Mediterranean (plus Macaronesian) versus non-Mediterranean haplotypes is indicated. The higher haplotype diversity in the Mediterranean (and Macaronesia) in contrast to the other parts of Europe is in accordance with genetic depletion in formerly glaciated areas.
41059824|Phylogenetic analyses based on five DNA plastid sequences from representative taxa of the Neotropical woody bamboo subtribe Guaduinae were performed to determine the generic limits of Olmeca and the relationships among its species. The phylogenetic position of a putative new taxon from Mexico was also determined. It appeared that, additional to the two species recognized in Olmeca, two Mesoamerican species of AulonemiaA. clarkiae and A. fulgorshould be transferred to Olmeca. This transfer is supported by morphology. Individuals of an undescribed taxon from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico, were also retrieved embedded in the Olmeca group and are newly described as O. zapotecorum. The distribution range of the redefined genus Olmeca, currently composed of five species, now extends from southern Mexico to Honduras.
41059825|Molecular phylogenetic analysis of the mitochondrial small subunit and nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA revealed that the lichen genus Graphis sensu Staiger represents two separate lineages. Graphis s.str. comprises the species of the G. scripta and G. subserpentina groups ('Eugraphis'), as well as the G. striatula group sensu Lcking. For the segregate genus, the name Allographa Chevall. is available, and this genus includes the G. acharii, G. dussii, G. marginata, G. nuda, and G. symplecta groups. The separation of both lineages is supported by principal component analysis species ordination based on phenotype characters, although the G. dussii and G. subserpentina groups appear phenotypically intermediate. Species formerly placed in Hemithecium subg. Hemithecium sensu Staiger were shown to belong to at least four lineages, one nested within Graphis (H. implicatum), one within Allographa (H. chlorocarpum), one sister to Allographa (H. rufopallidum), and one nested within the Phaeographis clade (H. plicosum). Allographa is genetically close to the bulk of lirellate Graphidaceae (Diorygma, Glyphis, Pallidogramme, Phaeographis, Platygramme, Platythecium, Sarcographa, Thalloloma, Thecaria), whereas Graphis s.str. exhibits unique genetic apomorphies and takes a more isolated position.
41059826|Little is known about the contribution of interspecific hybridization, a frequent phenomenon in plants, to the high plant diversity in southeastern Europe, one of the continent's diversity hot spots. A good system to study the relevance of hybridization for biodiversity in this region is Veronica subg. Pseudolysimachium sect. Pseudolysimachion (Plantaginaceae). Depending on the presumed frequency of hybridization, existing taxonomic concepts in this group range from distinguishing only morphological races without explicit taxonomic status to recognizing several species each with a series of intraspecific taxa. Using genetic (plastid sequences and AFLP fingerprints), ploidy-level and morphometric data, three core groups, pertaining to the currently recognized species V. barrelieri, V. orchidea, and V. spicata, were identified. All three species are, however, connected by numerous and gradual genotypic transitions and show rampant discrepancies between genetic and morphometric-taxonomic assignments. Complete homogenization of the three core groups is probably prevented by geographic isolation, ecological divergence and ploidy differences. Misinterpretation of hybrid swarms as separate taxa and the mosaic distribution of different indumentum types have led to a gross overestimation of taxonomic diversity of V. sect. Pseudolysimachion in southeastern Europe. Taxonomically, this might be accommodated by reducing V. barrelieri, V. orchidea and V. spicata to subspecific rank and abandoning recognition at least of those subspecies and varieties included in our study.
41059827|We analysed phylogenetic relationships in the order Cucurbitales using 14 DNA regions from the three plant genomes: the mitochondrial nadl b/c intron and matR gene, the nuclear ribosomal 18S, ITS1-5.8S-ITS2, and 28S genes, and the plastid rbcL, matK, ndhF, atpB, trnL, trnL-trnF, rpl20-rps12, trnS-trnG and trnH-psbA genes, spacers, and introns. The dataset includes 664 ingroup species, representating all but two genera and over 25% of the ca. 2600 species in the order. Maximum likelihood analyses yielded mostly congruent topologies for the datasets from the three genomes. Relationships among the eight families of Cucurbitales were: (Apodanthaceae, Anisophylleaceae, (Cucurbitaceae, ((Coriariaceae, Corynocarpaceae), (Tetramelaceae, (Datiscaceae, Begoniaceae))))). Based on these molecular data and morphological data from the literature, we recircumscribe tribes and genera within Cucurbitaceae and present a more natural classification for this family. Our new system comprises 95 genera in 15 tribes, five of them new: Actinostemmateae, Indofevilleeae, Thladiantheae, Momordiceae, and Siraitieae. Formal naming requires 44 new combinations and two new names in Cucurbitaceae.
41059828|Molecular phylogenies which include multiple accessions of species and near complete taxon sampling can be an important tool for estimating species diversity when used in combination with traditional morphology-based taxonomy. Here we use a densely sampled plastid gene tree for a morphologically complex group within the legume genus Mimosa (sect. Batocaulon ser. Andinae) to improve estimates of species limits and diversity in the poorly known dry inter-Andean valley of the Ro Maran, northern Peru. Based on the plastid gene tree, Mimosa ser. Andinae, which previously comprised four species, is re-circumscribed to include six Andean dry-forest species from northern Peru, Ecuador and southern Colombia, including the new species, M. jaenensis, described here. A further three candidate species are identified within the section based on high levels of sequence variation among accessions. With the additional species, the Maran valley is now known to harbour nine narrowly restricted endemic species of Mimosa, a pattern of multiple congeneric endemics mirrored in many other plant genera as well as several animal groups. Our results, in combination with other published studies, suggest that overall species diversity in the Maran has been significantly under-estimated. Further work is needed to identify conservation priority areas in the Maran in order to protect its unique flora.
41059829|The subfamily Polygonoideae has a world-wide distribution and is an important component of many countries' floras. In this study we present the most comprehensive sampling available to date, including data from three chloroplast genes (matK, ndhF, rbcL) for 82 species in Polygonaceae (54 from Polygonoideae). Based on our results, we propose a new taxonomic classification for Polygonoideae that includes five well-supported tribes: Calligoneae, Fagopyreae, Persicarieae, Polygoneae, and Rumiceae. Overall, the results from molecular data represent significant progress in understanding the evolutionary relationships of major groups within the family. This classification also provides an assessment of diagnostic morphological characters for the tribes. The present work will promote reevaluation of morphological characters within this diverse group, especially synapomorphies for Polygonoideae, and for tribes with a particularly complex history such as Fagopyreae, Persicarieae, and Polygoneae. A new combination, Fagopyrum tibeticum, is proposed.
41059830|Lotononis is a large and taxonomically complex genus of the tribe Crotalarieae, with the majority of its species occurring within southern Africa. In this study, sequence and morphological data of the rare Lotononis macrocarpa was added to existing data matrices for the Crotalarieae and these were re-analyzed using both parsimony and model-based (Bayesian) analyses. Molecular systematic data (nrITS and rbcL) indicated that Lotononis is polyphyletic, with Lotononis sect. Euchlora as sister to Bolusia and Crotalaria and with L. macrocarpa close to the 'Cape' group of the Crotalarieae. As a result, the genus Euchlora is here reinstated and the new genus Ezoloba is described herein to accommodate the anomalous L. macrocarpa. Ezoloba is distinct in its 5+5 anther configuration, exceptionally large fruit, paired stipules, minutely serrate bracts and the presence of bracteoles. Within the remaining species of Lotononis, both combined and separate analyses of the morphological and sequence datasets revealed three strongly supported clades corresponding largely to clades recovered in previous cladistic analyses based on morphological, chemical and cytological data. These are here recognised at the generic level as Lotononis s.str., Leobordea and Listia and the necessary new name combinations are formalised. Characters supporting these generic re-alignments are discussed and a key to the 16 genera now recognized in the tribe Crotalarieae is presented.
41059831|Generic circumscription in Eriocaulaceae has been based primarily on one to few floral characters and phylogenetic relationships within the family have only recently been explored in detail. Here, we present a morphological and phylogenetic study of Blastocaulon and Paepalanthus ser. Leptocephali, based on individual and combined datasets of the psbA-trnH plastid region and nuclear ITS. All results rejected the monophyly of Blastocaulon. Based on results and previous analyses, we propose the synonymization of Blastocaulon under Paepalanthus, the only morphological distinction between the two genera being the number of pollen-sacs. Reduction of pollen-sac number has occurred more than once in the evolution of Eriocaulaceae.
41059832|Mosses are among the basal lineages of embryophytes and one of the three bryophyte lineages. In the present study, four regions of chloroplast DNA (rbcL-a, rps4, trnH-psbA, trnL intron) were used to investigate the applicability of DNA barcoding to four moss genera of Grimmiaceae (Racomitrium, Coscinodon, Grimmia, Schistidium) in China. The species resolution of the four loci examined was 65% (trnH-psbA), 59% (rps4), 53% (rbcL-a) and 29% (trnL intron). However, rps4 (59%) provided a higher value of monophyletic species with bootstrap support >50% than trnH-psbA (47%), rbcL-a. (35%), and trnL intron (18%). No multi-locus combinations could significantly increase the species resolution but they increased the percentages of monophyletic species with bootstrap support >50% compared to the best single locus. Species of the genus Racomitrium could be resolved completely by rps4 and mostly (>80%) by rbcL-a. or trnH-psbA. The species of Coscinodon (i.e., C. cribrosus) showed distinct plastid region sequences in rbcL-a, rps4, trnH-psbA, and trnL intron. Inter-specific sequence sharing or high intra-specific variability led to large amounts of barcoding failure in Grimmia and Schistidium. Furthermore, using a combination of morphological characteristics and DNA barcoding for identification, a moss species, Racomitrium elongatum, was recorded for the first time in China. The results suggest that trnH-psbA is potentially the best barcode in mosses and rps4 a good supplementary locus for future use, as standard plant barcodes (rbcL + matK) do not perform well in this taxonomic group.
41059833|The conservation of Acacia with an Australian type has been perhaps the most controversial issue to have been dealt with under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature in many years. Before, during and since the vote on the matter at the Seventeenth International Botanical Congress in Vienna, strong opinions have been expressed in print, on the web and in the popular media. Opponents of the Vienna decision are currently focusing on details of the process by which the vote was conducted, rather than on the merits or otherwise of the original proposal. They have signalled an intention to challenge and to try to overturn the Vienna decision at the Melbourne Congress. We are a group of taxonomists, from a range of backgrounds and with a range of opinions on the original proposal, who believe that the Vienna process was fundamentally sound, and that continuance of this argument in its current form is damaging to the international nomenclatural consensus. We provide this paper as, we hope, an objective, non-partisan summary of the issue and conclude with the recommendation that the international taxonomic community should accept the retypification of Acacia and move on.
41059836|We maintain that a review of the way in which votes that can be cast to influence the amendment of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN) are allocated is overdue. Although there will no doubt be resistance to proposed changes that may emanate from such a review, a more representative system of vote allocation to herbaria, among other things, will considerably enhance the credibility and robustness of the voting system. A rebuttal addressing two criteria we suggest as examples of what could be used as part of a review to make the voting system more representative was recently published by Applequist & al. It is regrettable that in the face of unambiguous statistics that show the inadequacy of the current ICBN amendment voting system, the need for change is not embraced with due urgency. A fear of power sharing and decentralization may well be the root cause.
41059837|The previous typification of Leontodon taraxacum L. ( Taraxacum officinale F.H. Wigg.) and hence of the generic name Taraxacum is analysed. It is shown that the typification and consequent nomenclatural and interpretation changes have been almost totally ignored by the botanical public and therefore have become a source of ambiguity or confusion, and that the previous lectotype is in serious conflict with the protologue. A new lectotype is designated that is in accordance with the protologue and corresponds to the currently generally adopted reasonably broad interpretation of Taraxacum officinale as a name of an aggregate of agamospermous and sexual common dandelions. The new lectotype is "Dens leonis latiore folio Bauh., In Lusatia, Bohemia, Dania," J. Burser vi. 37 (UPS). In order to retain the broad-sense interpretation of the name, the authors do not recommend subsequent epitypification of the name.
41059838|Tubifera J. F. Gmel. 1792 is a genus of Myxomycetes that has been used in floras and monographs since the 18th century. The name became controversial when it appeared that Tubulifera Jacq. 1779 was a priorable name for the genus. This paper presents a history of the controversy, interprets Jacquin's original text, and offers reasons why Tubulifera cannot be regarded as a validly published generic name. The name Tubifera J.F. Gmel. is thus shown to remain the correct name for the genus.

41317130|An account is given of the circumstances that led to the decision to create the International Organization of Plant Biosystematics. The pioneer work of biologists on both sides of the Atlantic in biosystematics and experimental taxonomy is outlined, especially that of the San Francisco Bay group in the U.S.A. and that of J.S.L. Gilmour, G. Turesson, and J.W. Gregor on genecology and the deme terminology in Europe. The continuing need for a biosystematics perspective in our understanding of taxonomy at the species level and below is stressed.
41317131|Since the discovery of polyploidy (the presence of more than two chromosome sets in a nucleus) a century ago, scientists have investigated and speculated about the factors that could promote polyploid formation. One of the oldest and most enduring ideas is that hybridization promotes whole-genome doubling. First suggested by . Winge, this concept was developed and refined by the major plant evolutionary biologists of the last century, and especially in the biosystematic thinking of J. Clausen, D.D. Keck and W.M. Hiesey. In the past few years, this issue has been revisited by various authors, using molecular systematic methods to study patterns of parental divergence in relation to the formation of polyploids. Progress in molecular genetics and genome evolution also allows re-appraisal of the mechanistic arguments put forward by earlier researchers. Here we survey and critically appraise developments in this field over the past century, and conclude that in the light of recent progress there is not currently persuasive evidence that hybridization between divergent parents serves as a driver for polyploidization.
41317132|Here we illustrate and discuss the major challenges involved in reticulate phylogenetic reconstruction, with special reference to single-and low-copy nuclear data (the RNA polymerase genes) produced for the polyploid Cerastium alpinum group and close relatives. The dynamic nature of polyploid genomes paves the way for evolutionary novelty, and is obviously an important clue for the evolutionary success of polyploid plants, but at the same time it also creates problems in reconstructing the evolutionary history of polyploids. Nascent allopolyploids will hold two homoeologous copies of every gene that is initially single-copy in the parental species; however, immediately after the polyploidization event, modification of the polyploid genome starts, involving gene silencing, pseudogenization and divergence of duplicated genes. Identifying the signatures of reticulation, especially when dealing with old polyploids, may thus be a huge challenge. Sorting of ancestral/diploid variation in the polyploids and additional gene losses and duplications not associated with polyploidy may further complicate the case.Besides these general problems related to incongruent gene and organism lineage phylogenies, there are also several methodological challenges connected with retrieving sequence information from polyploids, such as polymerase errors, differential amplification of homoeologs (PCR selection), generation of chimeric sequences during PCR, and selection of shorter and more common fragments and insertion of incorrect fragments during the cloning reaction.
41317133|Tragopogon mirus Ownbey and Tragopogon miscellus Ownbey are recent allotetraploids that have formed recurrently within the last 80 years, following the introduction of the diploids T. dubius Scop., T pratensis L. and T. porhfolius L. from Europe to North America. In some areas, the progenitor diploids still occur along with expanding populations of the allotetraploids, and the polyploids at those locations likely represent descendents of the nearby diploids. In most natural populations of T. mirus and T. miscellus, there are far fewer rDNA units of the common parent (T. dubius) than there are of the other diploid parent and in some rarely occurring individuals, one parental locus was > 90% deleted. Nevertheless, in contrast to several ancient Old World allotetraploids, gene copies from both parents are readily detected by molecular methods in both T. mirus and T. miscellus. In one population of T. mirus and herbarium specimens collected at the time of species origin the gene ratios were balanced. Several lineages of T. mirus and T. miscellus were recently successfully resynthesized from diploid species. Among 181 synthetic individuals analyzed, we observed frequent deviations from copy-number additivity; that is in most cases, the T. dubius homeologs were reduced in copy number. At the epigenetic level, the genes of T. dubius origin dominate expression in most natural and synthetic allopolyploids. The fact that some rDNA genotypes seen in 80-year-old allopolyploids are already evident in the first generation of synthetic lines supports the hypothesis that the extent and tempo of rDNA homogenization in older allopolyploids is largely influenced by genetic and epigenetic changes in the early generations. Thus, T. mirus and T. miscellus that formed repeatedly in the wild within the last century represent a unique system to study the early stages of genome evolution following interspecific hybridization and genome duplication. This review summarizes recent works on the rDNA chromosomal organization, repeat and loci inheritance and gene expression.
41317134|The evolution of polyploids is strongly influenced by their mode of origin. Autopolyploidy is often hampered by disturbances of chromosome pairing and segregation at meiosis, while allopolyploids exhibit fewer meiotic problems and potentially have selective advantages because of hybridity. Apomixis, the asexual reproduction via seed in flowering plants, can overcome problems of meiotic reduction, favouring range expansions of polyploids. We elucidate the origin and genetic structure of apomictic cytotypes of the alpine species Ranunculus kuepferi by analyzing five microsatellite loci (SSRs) and Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs) on eight diploid and twelve polyploid populations from across the range of the species. Multiple allelism appears in three SSR loci in all polyploid cytotypes and is likely a result of facultative unbalanced meiotic events, as it is typical for autopolyploids. Low frequencies of private AFLP fragments (3%) and SSR alleles (4%) in tetraploids suggest that they evolved from diploid populations without the contribution of another divergent parental gene pool. A Neighbor-joining tree of AFLPs revealed a low genetic divergence of cytotypes and at least three independent origins of tetraploid populations. Autopolyploidy is in R. kuepferi likely evolutionarily young and still has signatures of a facultative unbalanced meiosis. The shift to apomixis avoided consequences of meiotic problems and therefore enhanced rapid establishment of autotetraploids. The lack of hybridity in polyploids suggests that apomixis is successful even without genomic novelty. The distributional success of polyploid cytotypes is probably more due to the benefits of apomictic reproduction than to genetic consequences of polyploidization.
41317135|Interpretations of current diversity patterns based on the contraction/expansion model forced by climatic oscillations during the last two million years are commonplace in phylogeographic literature. Of the wealth of scientific studies accumulated during the past two decades in Europe, the ones we understand best are those mostly from higher latitudes, probably because patterns were simplified to a great extent by major losses of diversity during glacial periods. In Southern European regions (or in general, in those places where ice effects were less severe) the situation is quite different and to some extent opposite.These regions are referred to as refugia because they are known to contain more genetic diversity than elsewhere. This is not only due to preservation of genotypes that went extinct in other places, however, but also to the intensity and accumulation of a number of processes in a patchy landscape across a varied topography. A lack of general phylogeographic patterns in these regions is one consequence. Speaking of a single refugium to refer to each of the peninsulas, however, is an oversimplification.Even speaking of multiple unconnected refugia does not adequately reflect the complexity of the processes that shaped the current genetic and specific diversity.
41317136|The Carpathians belong to the main elements of the European Alpine System and have an important biogeographical location between the Balkan ranges in the South, the Alps in the West and the Scandinavian range in the North. However, until recently this area was rarely included in detailed phylogeographical studies that could bring insights into its biogeographical history, links with other mountain ranges and contemporary genetic structure of populations. Here, available phylogeographical studies on high-mountain plants that include data concerning the Carpathians are reviewed in order to (1) discuss regional phylogeographical structure and divergence of the Carpathian populations from those in other European mountain ranges, and (2) outline further perspectives of the Carpathian phylogeography. Analysis of available studies revealed the complexity of the biogeographical history of high-mountain plants. The studies show a deep phylogeographical structure in the Carpathians, mostly concurring with classical biogeographical boundaries, and suggesting a long-term isolation and restricted gene flow between the main Carpathian regions. For some species, though, recent dispersal events among isolated mountain ranges were detected. Such contrasting patterns were found at a larger geographical scale as well (e.g., between the Carpathians and the Alps).Several examples suggest the importance of the Carpathians in migration of arctic-alpine plants from the East and towards the North. In most reviewed studies, however, the Carpathians are only marginally represented and detailed intraspecific studies based on dense population coverage in all disjunct areas of species' ranges are clearly needed to obtain reliable information and confirm the preliminary phylogeographical patterns emerging from the overview presented here.
41317137|Asexual organisms often occupy larger and more northern distribution areas than their sexual relatives, and tend to colonize more frequently previously glaciated areas. These phenomena, summarized under the term "geographical parthenogenesis", seem to imply a short-term advantage of asexual reproduction. Alpine biota, for instance, with their short growing seasons, cold climates and climatic histories shaped by glaciations are predisposed for the evolution and spread of apomictic plants. However, patterns and causes of geographical parthenogenesis for alpine species remain elusive, and for many alpine taxa the mode of reproduction is only poorly characterized. A survey of apomictic species in the European Alps presents some examples and case studies on geographical parthenogenesis. The distribution pattern may be explained by better colonizing abilities of asexual organisms because of uniparental reproduction. Apomixis has been advantageous for re-colonization of the Alps after the retreat of glaciers, because of their ability to rapidly found populations via single individuals (Baker's Law).Asexual organisms also may perform better in diverse and narrow ecological niches. The distributional superiority of asexuals has also been attributed to indirect advantages of hybridity and/or polyploidy. Sexual hybrids or polyploids, however, when compared to sexual diploid progenitors, do not show patterns of geographical parthenogenesis. However, in the Alps, climatic oscillations may have triggered range fluctuations of species and breakdown of crossing barriers. Interspecific hybridization and polyploidy may have spurred recurrent origins of asexuality, while decreasing the fitness of sexual progenitor species.Biogeographical history in combination with the intrinsic advantages of apomixis may explain best the relative success of alpine apomictic plants.
41317138|The Neotropical region (tropical America) is the most species rich region on Earth. Several causes have been proposed to explain this extraordinary biodiversity, which may be very roughly classified into two major categories: 'biotic' (e.g. soil adaptations; biotic interactions with pollinators, dispersers and herbivores; niche conservatism; dispersal ability) and 'abiotic' (e.g. time; rainfall, temperature and area; mountain uplift; hydrological changes). In this paper we review the evidence for each of these postulated causes of diversification and provide general directions towards further testing. We highlight the need of more well-sampled and dated phylogenies and urge increased inter-disciplinary collaboration.
41317139|The origin and evolution of alpine floras potentially can be shaped by immigration via long-distance dispersal or migration over mountain chains. Alternatively, origins of alpine species may be referred to regional speciation via origins from lowland ancestors and adaptation to high altitudes. Moreover, evolutionary histories of alpine species have also been influenced by Quaternary glaciations. Range fluctuations due to climatic oscillations have caused vicariant speciation and secondary contact hybridization. However, comparative phylogenetic studies on alpine floras from mountain systems of different continents are scarce. Here we review the phylogenetic relationships of alpine species of Ranunculus, an almost cosmopolitan genus with alpine representatives in all major mountain systems of the world. Based on molecular phylogenetic analysis of 245 alpine and lowland species (based on a combined dataset of ITS, matK, trnK and psbJ-petA sequences), we try to elucidate origins of alpine buttercups. Results suggest that most major mountain systems (European Alpine System, Irano-Turanian mountains, Himalayas, Central Asian mountains, African mountains, and Andes) have been colonized multiple times independently; only the North American alpine species fall all into one clade. In the European and Irano-Turanian mountains, recruitment of alpine species from lower altitudes of the same area, and migration within the Tethyan area might have played a major role. The alpine species of the Himalayas, the Central Asian mountains, the North American alpine species and the Arctic species fall into another, distinct clade, which may suggest a northern migration route. The North American alpine clade comprises many lowland species and might have diversified via adaptive radiation. In contrast, the Himalayan species have no lowland source flora and might have originated from immigrants of the Central Asian mountains. Tropical alpine Ranunculi in the mountains of Eastern Africa and in Taiwan have originated after long-distance dispersal from other continents. The origin of the New Zealand alpines could have been referred to long-distance dispersal, probably following southern migration routes via the Antarctic and South America.The Andes have been colonized multiple times by related genera of Ranunculus. We conclude that autochthonous origins and regional diversification of buttercups play a major role in northern hemispheric mountain systems, where alpine species could have evolved from rich lowland source floras. In subtropical to tropical mountain systems, and in the Southern Hemisphere, alpine species have been rather recruited via immigration, including long-distance dispersal from other continents. A high adaptive potential of Ranunculus to alpine habitats might have helped to evolve alpine species all over the world.
41317140|Most taxa of European Gentianella sect. Gentianella are members of the group of Gentianella germanica, which is represented with 11 of its 15 taxa in the Alps. However, due to often minor morphological differentiation many of these taxa are lumped into informal aggregates. We give here an overview on taxonomy, distribution, and regional patterns in groups of closely related taxa and discuss evolutionary scenarios essentially based on morphological and AFLP evidence from earlier studies and new cpDNA RFLP data. Pleistocene climatic oscillations have obviously driven evolution in this group and have favoured cryptic speciation in G. germanica agg. resulting in the two widespread taxa G. germanica and G. rhaetica that may have come in secondary contact after the last glaciation in the western Alps. Other regional and local endemics from G. anisodonta agg. such as G. engadinensis and G. liburnica may represent peripheral isolates of G. anisodonta separated from this taxon by peripatric or parapatric speciation. There is also evidence for complex scenarios of introgression and reticulate evolution among G. rhaetica, G. obtusifolia, and G. austriaca in the eastern Alps. Such reticulate patterns and/or ancient polymorphism towards south-eastern Europe may be the reason for unclear relationships within G. austriaca agg. and its relation to other taxa.
41317141|The genus Melampodium consists of 40 species distributed throughout Mexico and Central America with extensions into the southwestern United States and Colombia and Brasil of South America. The genus reflects broad chromosomal evolution involving dysploidy and polyploidy with n = 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 18, 20, 23, 24, 27, 28, 30, and 33 having been documented (x = 9, 10, 11, 12, and 14). The most recent classification of the genus, based primarily on morphology and chromosome numbers, recognized six taxonomic sections: Alcina, Bibractiaria, Melampodium, Rhizomaria, Serratura, and Zarabellia. Section Melampodium, which contains 22 species, was divided into five series: Cupulata, Leucantha, Longipila, Melampodium, and Sericea. This hypothesis had been tested by previous morphological phenetic and cladistic analyses, and several problem areas had been highlighted, especially involving section Alcina, but no modifications to the classification have been made. Recent molecular studies utilizing nrlTS, 5S rDNA spacer and low-copy nuclear PgiC gene, plus plastid matK and psbA-trnH regions allow the classificatory hypothesis to be tested more precisely. Congruence between ITS and matK phylogenies for all species reveals sections Bibractiaria, Rhizomaria, and Serratura to be holophyletic. The largest section Melampodium is holophyletic with both plastid markers, but M. longipilum is shown as an outlier (tying to sect. Rhizomaria) in all nuclear marker phylogenies (ITS, PgiC and 5S rDNA spacer). Section Zarabellia appears holophyletic in matKbni biphyletic with ITS, suggesting recognition of two distinct series. Section Alcina is the most problematic, being triphyletic in ITS and matK, and with the species not connecting to the same relatives. These insights recommend recognition of three sections from within section Alcina, one housing M. nutans (Nutantia Stuessy, sect, nov.) another M. glabrum (Glabrata Stuessy, sect, nov.) and a third M. perfoliatum (sect.Alcina (Cav.) DC). These may represent ancient independent lines that have diverged from original x = 11 ancestors. Within section Melampodium, 5S rDNA NTS, PgiC and psbA-trnH, in addition to ITS and matK, provide insights on relationships among taxonomic series. Series Leucantha and Longipila are holophyletic, and series Cupulata nearly so, with M. glabribracteatum deserving treatment in a series of its own. The most complex relationships are between series Melampodium, Cupulata, and Sericea, the latter comprising five exclusively polyploid taxa (4JC and 6x). Molecular and cytogenetic data reveal allopolyploid origins for all of these polyploids, in some cases involving hybridization between the two series Cupulata and Melampodium/Sericea, such as with M. mayfieldii and M. longicorne, which exacerbates taxonomic circumscription.
41317142|Members of the Pilosella alpicola species group (Asteraceae) are distributed throughout the alpine region of the European mountains (Alps, Carpathians, Balkan mountains). Like other Pilosella species groups (Hieracium subg. Pilosella), the taxonomy and species' relationships are poorly understood mostly due to widespread facultative apomixis, frequent hybridization and polyploidization the most important phenomena substantially involved in the evolutionary history of the genus. We assessed morphology, ploidy level, variation in breeding system and molecular variation within the P. alpicola group to provide a new taxonomic concept and to clarify evolutionary relationships among species and origin of polyploids. Multivariate morphometric analyses (UPGMA, CDA, PCA) applied on 324 plants originated from 21 populations revealed existence of four well-separated clusters corresponding to four allopatric taxa: P. alpicola s. str. (Alps), P. rhodopea (Balkan Peninsula, Southern Carpathians), P. serbica (Serbia and Montenegro) and P. ullepitschii (Carpathians). In total, four ploidy levels (2x, 3X, 4X, 5X) were detected among 557 plants analysed from 19 populations by classical chromosome counting and flow cytometric analysis. The etra-and pentaploids of P. alpicola s.str. have an allopatric distribution (Wallis Alps vs. Dolomites, respectively). Four ploidy levels with complex cytogeographic pattern and high frequency of mixed ploidy populations (75%) indicating a primary contact zone were recorded in P. rhodopea. Pilosella ullepitschii and P. serbica are exclusively diploid and are both sexually reproducing. In spite of a clear morphological separation, a molecular analysis (ITS and cpDNA sequences) suggests close relationships and rather recent origin of all studied taxa, except P. alpicola s.str. The latter taxon is an agamospermic allopolyploid that likely originated polytopically from a hybridization between P. rhodopea from the Balkans and P. glacialis from the Alps. In contrast to P. alpicola s. str., our data strongly support an autopolyploid origin of P. rhodopea polyploids which reproduced strictly sexually. Pilosella petraea, sometimes treated as a member of the P. alpicola group, differs from the remaining taxa by its conspicuous morphology, ecology and ITS polymorphism and should be removed from the group. Range shifts and extinctions were likely involved in shaping the evolutionary and modern distributional pattern of the group. Our combined methodological approach enabled us to propose a new taxonomic circumscription for the P. alpicola group and revealed auto-and allopolyploidization events.
41317143|Lamioideae comprise the second-largest subfamily in Lamiaceae. Although considerable progress has recently been made in Lamioideae phylogenetics, the subfamily remains one of the most poorly investigated subfamilies in Lamiaceae. Here we present a taxonomic update of the subfamily based on earlier published data as well as 71 new DNA extracts from relevant in-and outgroup taxa, and DNA sequence data from four chloroplast regions (matK, rpsl6, trnL intron and trnL-F spacer). The phylogenetic positions of 10 out of 13 previously unplaced small or monotypic Asian lamioid genera and 37 additional lamioid species have been identified, and the classification is updated accordingly. Results from parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic methods corroborate earlier results, but phylogenetic resolution as well as overall branch support are improved. All newly added genera are assigned to earlier established tribes or the new tribe Paraphlomideae Bendiksby, which includes Ajugoides, Matsumurella and Paraphlomis. Acanthoprasium is resurrected as a genus. Transfer of species is proposed to accommodate the monophyly of two genera (Lamium, Otostegia), whereas ten genera remain non-monophyletic (Ballota s. str., Lagopsis, Leonotis, Leonurus, Leucas, Microtoena, Phlomoides, Sideritis, Stachys, Thuspeinanta). Eriophyton and Stachyopsis have been included in Lamieae, Hypogomphia in Stachydeae, and Loxocalyx in Leonureae. Betonica, Colquhounia, Galeopsis, and Roylea remain unclassified at the tribal level. Lamium chinense and three East Asian Galeobdolon species are transferred to Matsumurella. Sulaimania and four Otostegia species are transferred to Moluccella. Alajja and three Lamium species are transferred to Eriophyton. In total, 14 new combinations are made, one at the rank of subgenus and 13 at the rank of species.
41317144|Bactridinae include about 150 species of spiny Neotropical palms in five genera that are ecologically important in several vegetation types such as open woodland (Acrocomia), lowland rainforest (Astrocaryum, Bactris), and montane forest (Aiphanes). The subtribe also includes the only exclusively lianescent palm genus in the Neotropics (Desmoncus). We present a fully resolved molecular phylogeny of 41 species of Bactridinae, representing all genera as well as most of the currently accepted infrageneric taxa (subgenera, sections etc.) and recently proposed informal groups. Analyses are based on five plastid DNA regions (matK, trnQ-rpsl6, rps! 6 intron, trnD-trnT, trnL-trnF) and three nuclear markers (PRK, RPB2, ITS). A combined dataset was analysed with likelihood and parsimony methods. The results show that all accepted taxa at and above the generic level are monophyletic with high support. Astrocaryum alatum and A. mexicanum, recently segregated into a genus of their own (Hexopetiori), form a strongly supported monophyletic group sister to the remaining Astrocaryum species. Desmoncus and Acrocomia are resolved as sister genera, and together they are sister to the remaining Bactridinae. This finding contrasts with that of two previous studies reporting Acrocomia to be sister to the rest of the subtribe. Aiphanes is resolved as sister to Bactris and Astrocaryum. Species-level relationships recovered within Astrocaryum and Bactris disagree to a large extent with previous morphology-based infrageneric classifications, suggesting that those characters are homoplasious, particularly within Bactris. A Bayesian dating analysis using the relaxed-clock model indicates that most genera of Bactridinae diverged during a relatively short period around the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, which might explain the difficulties in resolving the phylogenetic backbone of the group. The mostly Andean genus Aiphanes shows an initial radiation of early lineages in the Oligocene (around 25 Ma ago) corresponding to an early uplift phase of the cordillera. These taxa are nowadays restricted to the mountain forests of Colombia and Ecuador. The main diversification of Andean Aiphanes began in the Miocene (around 11 Ma ago). This study provides the first substantial insight into Bactridinae phylogeny and sets the stage for more comprehensively sampled species-level studies analysing drivers of diversity of Neotropical palms, speciation patterns, character evolution, or biogeography.
41317145|Tetrastigma (Vitaceae) comprises about 95 species widely distributed throughout subtropical and tropical Asia, and extending to Australia. The genus is best known for being the host plants of Rafflesia, with the largest flower in the world, and other members of Rafflesiaceae. The phylogeny of Tetrastigma, however, remains poorly known. Four plastid markers (atpBrbcL, psbA-trnH, trnL-trnF intergenic spacers, rpsl6 intron) were employed to infer the first phylogeny of Tetrastigma. Our sampling included eleven reported host species of Rafflesiaceae, being scattered in seven major clades throughout the Tetrastigma tree. A Templeton test rejected the hypothesis of a single origin of the parasite-host relationship between Rafflesiaceae and Tetrastigma. Analysis of 114 accessions representing 53 species and four varieties throughout the distributional range of the genus provided robust support for the monophyly of Tetrastigma, yet Tetrastigma was found to be nested within Cayratia. Tetrastigma subg. Palmicirrata from the Sino-Himalayan region was nested within the large and widely distributed T. subg. Tetrastigma. Two major clades (clades A and F) in our phylogeny correspond to T. sect. Tetrastigma and T. sect. Carinata of subgenus Tetrastigma, respectively.
41317146|Haplophyllum A. Juss. is one of the most species-rich, but poorly-known genera of Rutaceae (citrus family), reaching maximum species diversity in Turkey, Iran, and Central Asia. Many of its species exhibit a narrow geographic range (" narrow endemics"), which makes them particularly vulnerable to extinction. Despite its importance for the characterization of the Irano-Turanian floristic region, the evolution of species diversity in Haplophyllum has never been examined in a phylogenetic and biogeographic context. We generated gene trees from DNA sequences of four regions of the chloroplast genome for 118 accessions, representing 66% of the species diversity of the genus. Additionally, Haplophyllum was examined morphologically. The phylogenetic analyses showed that several species of the genus do not form reciprocally monophyletic groups. Optimization of morphological characters on the chloroplast DNA phylogeny indicated that most of the species, in particular those with a widespread geographic distribution, can only be diagnosed by combinations of homoplasious character states. Homoplasy notwithstanding, the main morphological characters traditionally used to classify the genus are consistent with the molecular phylogeny of Haplophyllum. Finally, the Mediterranean representatives of Haplophyllum were found to be embedded within a clade that includes primarily Irano-Turanian species, suggesting multiple invasions of the Mediterranean basin from the east.
41317147|We explored the spatiotemporal diversification of the Centaurea cineraria group based on AFLP fingerprints and plastid DNA sequences applied to a broad sampling of Central Mediterranean taxa of the Acrolophus subgroup. Despite its morphological distinctness, monophyly of the C. cineraria group was not supported by our data. A distinct lineage mostly restricted to Sicily (the Sicily group) comprised some members of the C. cineraria group but also included C. parlatoris, assumed to be a member of the C. dissecta group. The relationships of the Sicily group with other members of the Acrolophus subgroup could not be clarified. Molecular dating supported recent, presumably allopatric diversification whose onset dates back to less than 250,000 years within the Sicily group. Tunisia, the Aeolian Islands and the Island Ventotene in the central Tyrrhenian Sea were likely colonised from Sicily. The young age of diversification within the Sicily group rejects land bridges between Africa and Sicily, which were only available during significantly older periods, in favour of transoceanic seed dispersal. Dispersal might have been favoured by low sea levels during cold stages of the Pleistocene. The molecular data indicate that taxonomy of the C. cineraria group needs to be revised.
41317148|We investigated the phylogeny of the Arctioid lineage of the Arctium-Cousinia complex in an attempt to clarify the conflictive generic boundaries of Arctium and Cousinia. The study was based on analyses of one nuclear (ITS) and two chloroplastic (trnL-trnT-rps4, rpl32-trnL) DNA regions of 37 species and was complemented with morphological evidence where possible. Based on the results, a broadly redefined monophyletic genus Arctium is proposed. The subgenera Hypacanthodes and Cynaroides are not monophyletic and are suppressed. In contrast, the traditional sectional classification of the genus Cousinia is maintained. The genera Anura, Hypacanthium and Schmalhausenia are reduced to sectional level.
41317149|Endocarps of the genus Prunus (family Rosaceae) have been described from early Eocene clay deposits in the Wutu Coal Mine, Shandong Province, China. Endocarps are elliptical or ovoid in lateral view, with a long canal that approaches the apex of the endocarp and contains the ventral vascular bundle. Comparisons with related living and fossil species of Prunus indicate that these endocarps should be assigned to Prunus wutuensis sp. nov. The endocarps from Wutu represent the earliest record of Prunus in Asia. Based on the distribution of fossil Prunus endocarps, the palaeobiogeographic history of the genus is shown on palaeogeographic maps of the Northern Hemisphere. The fossil data suggest that the genus first appeared in the early Eocene of North America and Asia, and then extended to Europe in the middle Eocene.
41317150|Plant collections in herbaria are potentially valuable seed sources for conservation and recovery. This paper explores the feasibility of "resurrecting" 26 extinct taxa from the Belgian flora by analysing the viability of seeds from old herbarium specimens that had been stored for 23 to 158 years. Seed viability was estimated by performing germination tests according to standard procedures. Germination was achieved for eight seeds from three herbarium specimens of a single species, Bupleurum tenuissimum, aged 101, 125 and 144 years. Seed maturity, storage conditions and seed senescence were the main factors influencing the viability of the investigated seeds.
41317151|We propose a once-off "special committee" to developed a proposal that could resolve the entrenched positions in the case of the typification of Acacia. It is important that such a proposal has a broad, consensual, support, rather than rely on a "winner takes all" approach.
41317152|A complete nomenclatural treatment of the genera Filago L. and Logfia Cass. is provided, as well as a list of the species included in each genus and subgenus, as they have been newly circumscribed. Nomenclatural types for eleven validly published species names are designated, which correspond to (1) the types of names of widely used and long-established genera or subgenera, (2) the names of species that have been chosen as types of the names of newly described or newly delimited subgenera, or (3) recently proposed new combinations at the specific level. In total, one subgeneric name is typified and eleven lectotypes, five epitypes and one neotype are chosen. Among those, a previous attempted typification of F. pygmaea L. is shown to be inadmissible and a new lectotype is chosen and an epitype is selected to support interpretation of a previously designated lectotype. The need to conserve the name F. vulgaris to preserve current usage is documented.
41317153|Errors in the type citation of Beilschmiedia xizangensis H. P. Tsui are discussed. As originally intended, the holotype collection should be Cheng Shu-zhi & Li Bo-sheng 4694 (PE), not Cheng Shu-zhi & Li Bo-sheng 4649 (PE) or Department of Ecology, Section of Plateau 11052 (PE). The name thus applies to a species of Beilschmiedia distinct from B. robusta.
41317154|The name Cotoneaster tomentosus and its basionym Mespilus tomentosa are shown to be illegitimate because when published both included the earlier legitimate name, M. orientalis. The original circumscription of M coccinea was based mostly on the material of C. tomentosus with misadditions of C. niger and C. integerrimus s. l. Fruit characters of the latter taxon provided the species epithet. The previous intended lectotypes of M. orientalis and M. coccinea are superseded because they were selected from non-original material; the new lectotypes are designated here. The history of Pal KitaibeFs material of Cotoneaster is traced, and its identity is established. Cotoneaster coccineus is the earliest name available for the red-fruited cotoneaster with hairy hypanthia native in Europe and would have to be adopted if M. tomentosa is not conserved against M. orientalis.
41317155|It is recommended that the name Dasya baillouviana not be conserved with a conserved type; the committee is undecided on the proposal to conserve Achnanthes brevipes against A. adnata, A. bacillarioides, and A. dubia, and is seeking more comments by diatom specialists. Sycidium and Sykidion were considered not sufficiently alike to be confused, but the committee is undecided on the confusability of Sycidiaceae with Sykidiaceae and Sycidiales with Sykidiales. Recommendations are made on the membership of the Special Committee on Harmonization of the Nomenclature of CyanophytalCyanobacteria established in 2005 but yet to be set up. The Committee's views on some modifications to the ICBN are presented including some proposals that might be made from the floor at the forthcoming Congress in Melbourne.
41317176|Recommendations by the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi regarding proposals to amend the Code pertaining to fungi are reported. A 60% or greater majority recommends acceptance of proposals on: (1) the governance of fungi in the Code: Gen. Prop. A-B, Div. Ill Prop.

41317236|The phylogeny of Vitaceae was reconstructed sampling 114 accessions of Vitaceae and the outgroup Leea of Leeaceae, using three noncoding plastid markers: trnC-petN, trnH-psb, and trnL-F. Six 5-merous genera including Parthenocissus, Yua, Ampelocissus, Vitis, Nothocissus, and Pterisanthes form a well-supported clade. Ampelopsis, Rhoicissus, and the Cissus striata complex form a clade sister to the clade containing all the other taxa of Vitaceae. The core Cissus clade is resolved to be sister to the Cayratia-Tetrastigma-Cyphostemma clade, forming a clade of taxa with 4-merous flowers. The Parthenocissus-Yua clade is sister to the Ampelocissus-Vitis-Nothocissus-Pterisanthes clade. The Old World Cissus is paraphyletic, with the New World core Cissus nested within it. The intercontinental disjunction between Africa and Asia may have evolved at least twice in Cissus. Cayratia is paraphyletic with four Asian species sampled grouping with Tetrastigma and the African species forming another clade.
41317237|Diplolepis, a genus from southern South America traditionally considered monotypic, has recently been shown from molecular data to include a few species that form a monophyletic group at the base of the MOG clade of Asclepiadoideae (Apocynaceae). The species transferred to Diplolepis include plants from temperate South America mostly described under the generic name "Cynanchum". Phylogenetic analyses of cpDNA trnT-trnF and rpsl6 sequences of 51 accessions of Asclepiadaceae using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference methods show that all "Cynanchun" from southern Argentina and Chile (except C. atacamense), Tweedia australis and Diplolepis form a well-supported monophyletic group. Within this group, three clades are recognized: two morphologically homogeneous groups from South Andean forests and high elevation areas, and a more diverse group in flower and leaf morphology from southern South American desert and semidesert areas.The phylogenetic position of C. atacamense is equivocal but the species is transferred to Diplolepis based on morphological and biogeographical coherence. The morphological, geographical and environmental characteristics of the three recognized clades of Diplolepis are discussed and eight nomenclatural changes are proposed.
41317238|Phylogenetic analyses have suggested that the everlasting daisy tribe Gnaphalieae colonized the globe repeatedly and rapidly from southern Africa. However, both the circumscription of monophyletic groups of "out of Africa" Gnaphalieae genera and the identification of their sister groups in southern Africa has proved difficult. We have analysed sequences of nrDNA spacers (ITS, ETS), cpDNA (ndhF, trnL intron, trnL-trnF intergenic spacer, trnK intron), and low-copy nuclear markers to examine selected relationships within the crown radiation of the tribe. We focused on relationships among two putative clades suggested by previous studies and a representative sampling of genera endemic to Australasia. Incongruities between nrDNA and cpDNA trees are frequent and some involve robustly supported clades. However, trees generated for two lowcopy nuclear markers are largely congruent with each other but imply that allopolyploidy preceded the radiations of at least four separate extant lineages within the tribe, one largely or entirely restricted to Australasia, one almost global, and two still poorly sampled. Collectively, these four putative allopolyploid lineages may account for more than half of the described species diversity of the tribe.
41317239|Little is known about vegetative morphological diversification in Neotropical plant clades in comparison with diversification of reproductive characters. Phylogenetic relationships of the Neotropical Heliotropium (Heliotropiaceae) were studied using sequences of nrlTS and four plastid regions (trnL-trnF, trnS-trnG, trnH-psbA, rpsl6). Vegetative morphological diversity (leaf morphology, habit), measured as amount of morphospace occupied and as variance of individual characters, was compared among the clades resolved and between groups of species inhabiting dry and humid areas. Three well-supported clades were recovered: (1) Heliotropium sect. Heliothamnus from the tropical Andes; (2) Heliotropium sect. Cochranea from the Peruvian and the Atacama Deserts; and (3) the Tournefortia clade, comprising the remaining American sections of Heliotropium and the mainly Neotropical Tournefortia sect.Tournefortia.Phylogenetic discordance detected between the plastid and nuclear partitions may have been due to lineage sorting, hybridization or differences in number of informative sites. Morphological diversity was largest in the Tournefortia clade and tended to be greater in dry than in humid areas, but without statistical support.Heliotropium sect. Cochranea was as diverse as the Tournefortia clade in leaf morphology and may have experienced adaptive radiation in the Atacama Desert. Lowest vegetative diversity was found in Heliotropium sect. Heliothamnus. The infrageneric delimitation in Heliotropium needs reassessment.
41317240|Tribe Lycieae (Solanaceae) currently includes ca. 92 species in three genera. Two genera account for only a few species, as Phrodus is monotypic and Grabowskia includes just four species. By contrast, Lycium is one of the largest genera in the family, with ca. 88 species and over 95% of the species diversity in tribe Lycieae. Previous molecular studies have suggested that Lycium is paraphyletic and that species of Grabowskia are nested within Lycium. These studies also suggested that the genus Grabowskia was monophyletic, but questioned the integrity of species within it. Likewise, although the genus is defined by a unique fruit structure, morphology is of limited use in distinguishing species within Grabowskia.Depending on the study, Phrodus microphyllus has been placed either as sister to the rest of the tribe or nested within Lycium. In the present study we include data from two nuclear regions (granule-bound starch synthase and nitrate reductase) and four plastid spacer regions (trnH-pbsA, trnDGUC -trnTGGU, rpl32-trnLUAG , ndhF-rpl32) to more clearly resolve evolutionary relationships among genera within the tribe and among species in Grabowskia.Results confirm that Lycium is paraphyletic and includes a monophyletic Grabowskia. However, inclusion of multiple accessions of several Grabowskia species does not support the maintenance of distinct species in the genus. In addition, Phrodus microphyllus is moderately supported as basal within the tribe. Given these results, which are further strengthened by morphological and cytological data, we synonymize three Grabowskia species with Grabowskia boerhaviifolia and include this species within Lycium, using its basionym, Lycium boerhaviifolium L. f. Additionally, we transfer Phrodus microphyllus to the genus Lycium, proposing a new combination: Lycium bridgesii (Miers) Levin, Miller & Bernardello. Tribe Lycieae is now monotypic, including the single genus Lycium.
41317241|Molecular-phylogenetic analyses of a large sampling of Artemisia subg. Dracunculus were carried out under Bayesian and maximum parsimony criteria to circumscribe the subgenus and explore the relationships between the species in the core of the subgenus. The Dracunculus complex was resolved into two main clades: one core clade including most of the Eurasian representatives plus a few closely related North American endemic species, and a second, small clade including A. salsoloides and A. tanaitica. Segregation of the latter two species is proposed in order to keep the subgenus monophyletic. Within the core clade, the existence of different lineages such as the A. dracunculus or A. campestris complexes, as well as the relationships of Mausoleo, Neopallasia and Turaniphyturn, are scrutinized. Discordances between the molecular data and previous morphological taxonomie treatments are noted. The occurrence of polyploidy in the subgenus is explored using previously published and newly generated genome size data.
41317242|Euphorbia subg. Esula (Euphorbiaceae) has recently been shown, using molecular analyses, to contain a clade with a disjunct distribution in Macaronesia, South Africa and the Eritreo-Arabian region, and being primarily made up of members of sect. Tithymalus subsect. Pachycladae and sect. Tirucalli. To delimitate this disjoint group, we carried out phylogenetic analyses of the internal transcribed spacer (nrlTS) using a broad sampling, with emphasis on subg.Esula.Subsequently, we carried out phylogenetic analyses focused on this clade using nuclear (ITS, ETS) and chloroplast (trnL-trnF, psbA-trnH, ycf3-trnS, trnG, atpB-rbcL, trnK-matK, trnT-trnL) markers, with the aim of resolving the phylogenetic relationships within the group and reconstructing its biogeographic history. Our results showed that sect. Tithymalus subsect. Pachycladae and sect.Tirucalli are polyphyletic. Section Aphyllis is recircumscribed to comprise the Pachycladae core clade and part of sect.Tirucalli. Low resolution within sect. Aphyllis and incongruences between nuclear and chloroplast phylogenies may be due to hybridization. Section Aphyllis should have originated in the Mediterranean area; its disjunct distribution is probably due to vicariance, resulting from fragmentation of a wider distribution area in North Africa caused by the aridification of the climate during the late Miocene-Pliocene.
41317243|The presented molecular and cytological study of the European Potentilla argentea group (Rosaceae) demonstrates the importance of ploidy differentiation for the evolutionary diversification in apomictic plants. Despite the frequent occurrence of cytologically-polymorphic populations in apomicts, few studies have addressed the evolutionary relationships among cytotypes and their taxonomie implications. Combined analyses of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), chloroplast DNA sequences, and ploidy have identified three main evolutionary lineages within the Potentilla argentea group. The molecular data unravelled a clear separation of European P. argentea s. l. into a diploid and a hexaploid lineage, as well as a Southern European diploid P. calabra. Potentilla argentea var.pseudocalabra was intermediate between hexaploid P. argentea and P. calabra.Diploid and hexaploid P. argentea occur separately in Western and Eastern Europe, respectively, but are found in sympatry in Central and Northern Europe. Population genetic patterns and character incompatibility tests suggested that hexaploids were apomictic, while diploid P. argentea and P. calabra were selfers and outcrossers, respectively. The data strongly support the consideration of all three taxa as separate species and an allopolyploid origin for the hexaploid P. argentea. Furthermore, the results are concordant with the strong correlation between polyploidy and apomixis in other species, and provide a model system for studying the origin of apomixis involving autogamous diploids.
41317244|Species radiations in the Hawaiian Islands have resulted in closely related yet morphologically and often ecologically distinct species, many of which have highly restricted distributions. Eleven species of Pittosporum (Pittosporaceae) are recognized in the Hawaiian Islands, yet it remains unclear whether the morphological variation within Hawaiian Pittosporum is due to hybridization, genetic polymorphism, phenotypic plasticity, or some combination of these processes. In this study of Hawaiian Pittosporum we used a genome-wide approach employing 626 Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs) to test species boundaries and elucidate gene flow within and among species. Parsimony trees were constructed to identify clades of individuals that correspond to species, island affinity, and/or sexual system. Network analysis was used to identify the number of lineages in the dataset; results showed a lack of resolution due to reticulation. Based on Bayesian assignment tests, Hawaiian Pittosporum exhibited high levels of gene flow. The interspecific allelic exchange and reticulation caused non-hierarchical relationships between species and a lack of reproductive isolation rendered species boundaries permeable. This study highlights the impact of hybridization on species persistence and conservation as well as on general patterns of Hawaiian biota.
41317245|Orbicules are tiny a-cellular sporopollenin structures that occur in the anthers of many angiosperms together with the pollen grains. Although their occurrence is common, little is known about their function and systematic usefulness. With regard to orbicules, Rubiaceae (Gentianales) are the most intensively studied plant family and therefore an ideal case to present the evolution and phylogenetic signal of orbicule characters at family level. The occurrence and morphology of orbicules was investigated in 64 species of Rubiaceae using scanning electron microscopy. Five relevant orbicule features (presence/absence, abundance, size, shape, ornamentation) were optimized onto a custom-made phylogeny of the family. By optimizing the five orbicule characters some evolutionary trends can be observed. The previously suggested trend in angiosperms towards orbicule absence in more derived taxa is confirmed for Rubiaceae. Orbicules appear to have been independently lost at least nine times within the family, with two subsequent reversals. Small orbicules represent the plesiomorphic character state for the family.A trend from spherical towards irregular orbicules is observed, while ornamented orbicules occur only in derived lineages.Orbicule characters are constant at generic level and in most cases at tribal level, and therefore have potential for systematics.The presence of orbicules is correlated with the occurrence of a non-amoeboid tapetum.
41317246|Hybridization is one of the main sources of taxonomie complexity in Potamogeton. In spite of long and intensive research, the total hybrid diversity and distribution of many hybrids are still insufficiently known. Identities of two currently recognized hybrids were tested using molecular analyses of plants from the original clones growing at the type localities of their correct names. Additive characters in direct sequencing of the ITS region and the placement of cloned sequences in a Bayesian consensus tree were used to identify the exact identity of these hybrids. Potamogeton xlanceolatifolius is widely recognized as a hybrid P. gramineus x P. polygonifolius. However, the molecular analyses and cytological investigation identified this Swedish hybrid as P. gramineus x P. nodosus although P. nodosus currently does not occur in the whole of Scandinavia. This hybrid provides some insight into the former distribution area of P. nodosus as affected by past climatic changes. The recently detected P. xvepsicus was originally described as P. alpinus x P. natans but the molecular investigation revealed that its correct identity is P. natans x P. praelongus. In both cases, the actual identities could hardly have been unequivocally deduced from the morphology of the hybrids. The existence of these hybrid combinations is here confirmed for the first time. The maternally inherited chloroplast rpl20-5' rpsl2 sequences were used to identify the female parental species. The name "P. xargutulus", previously, but erroneously, used for a hybrid P. gramineus x P. nodosus, is typified and reduced to the synonymy of P. gramineus.
41317247|The polyphyletic genus Chirita is remodelled after an extensive molecular phylogenetic study of species assigned to it and to other associated genera. Most of Chirita sect. Chirita and the monotypic Hemiboeopsis are amalgamated with Henckelia sect. Henckelia, resulting in a very differently circumscribed genus Henckelia and the synonymisation of Chirita. The remaining species of Chirita sect.Chirita are accommodated in the revived genus Damrongia. Chirita sect.Liebigia is recognised as the genus Liebigia. Chirita sect. Microchirita is recognised as the genus Microchirita. Chirita sect. Gibbosaccus is, together with Chiritopsis and Wentsaiboea, included in the originally monotypic and now enormously expanded genus Primulina. The necessary combinations are made and a general list showing the present accommodation of the species previously described under Chirita, Chiritopsis, Hemiboeopsis, Primulina and Wentsaiboea is provided.
41317248|Croton (Euphorbiaceae) is a large and diverse group of plants that is most species-rich in the tropics. We update the infrageneric classification of the New World species of Croton with new evidence from phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence data from all three genomes. The relationships of species that were previously placed in conflicting positions by nuclear and chloroplast data, such as C. cupreatus, C. poecilanthus, and C. setiger, are further resolved by adding the nuclear EMB2765 and mitochondrial rps3 genes to the molecular sampling. Analyses of rps3 reveal an accelerated rate of evolution within Croton subg. Geiselena, the only one of the four subgenera that contains numerous herbaceous, annual species. We provide morphological descriptions, species lists, and a key to the 31 sections and 10 subsections recognized in the New World.New taxa that we describe include C. sects. Alabamenses, Argyranthemi, Cordiifolii, Corinthii, Cupreati, Luetzelburgiorum, Nubigeni, Olivacei, Pachypodi, Prisci, and C. subsects. Cubenses, Jamaicenses, and Sellowiorum. Additional transfers are made to the ranks of subgenus, section, and subsection. A total of 712 species of Croton are currently recognized for the New World, with 702 of them assigned here to section.
41317249|We redefine the fern genus Anisocampium based on the results of a phylogenetic analysis using two regions of the chloroplast genome. The redefined genus is separate from Athyrium s.str. and comprises four species, two of which were previously assigned to Athyrium or Kuniwatsukia. Anisocampium paucijugum is reduced to a synonym of A. cumingianum.The four accepted species in Anisocampium are morphologically distinct but the putative hybrid An. xsaitoanum suggests low reproductive isolation in the genus. Anisocampium can be distinguished from related genera by a combination of characters only.
41317250|Agarum is a perennial kelp genus that has a broad distribution from the northwest Pacific to the northwest Atlantic Ocean. In order to address questions regarding phylogenetic relationships and present-day distribution patterns of species within this genus, we analyzed the nuclear ITS2, mitochondrial cox1 and cox3, and plastid RuBisCO spacer from a subset of 130 samples of the genus plus Thalassiophyllum and Costarla. All analyses of the individual markers and the ITS2+cox1+cox3 dataset consistently produced a clade of Agarum that included Thalassiophyllum. The clade consisted of two well-resolved subclades: one composed of A. fimbriatum and A. oharaense, and the other of A. clathratum, A. turneri, A. yakishiriense, and T. clathrus (the type of the generic name Thalassiophyllum). On the basis of these results, we treat Thalassiophyllum as a synonym of Agarum, reinstating the combination A. clathrus made by Greville in 1830. Despite its wide distribution from Japan through Alaska to the east coast of North America, A. clathratum had low genetic diversity, suggesting a relatively recent long-distance dispersal of the species. The low degree of substitutions between A. clathratum and A. yakishiriense suggests their recent divergence from a common ancestor, and we recognize the latter as a subspecies of the former. Because type material of A. clathratum has not been found, we designate as neotype a specimen collected in Kamchatka, one of two syntype localities cited by Gmelin for Fucus agarum.
41317251|Bark anatomy is an unappreciated discipline in plant systematics, despite its great potential to reveal systematically informative features. In this paper, main reasons for the lack of detailed bark anatomical data in many plant families are identified, including problems with sectioning, terminological issues, and difficulties in observation of dilated stems. We deal with these problems by focusing on two aspects: (1) compare, discuss and improve existing sectioning and maceration techniques using two species with soft and hard bark tissues; and (2) discuss the best way to collect stem bark samples. We hope that this paper will stimulate inclusion of bark anatomical data in future systematic studies.
41317252|The arguments towards resolving the Acacia nomenclatural controversy put forth by Thiele & al. (2011) are reviewed and rebutted. We argue that a truly pragmatic and, moreover, defensible and equitable alternative to accepting the retypification of Acacia Mill, with a conserved type would be to have the 2006 International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, excluding this retypification, serve as the basis for discussions at the Nomenclature Section of the Melbourne International Botanical Congress in 2011. We, and a large component of the international taxonomie community, and beyond, remain convinced that the minority rule voting procedure used at Vienna on Acacia was inappropriate, resulting in animosity that will without any doubt linger until this situation is rectified. Such a minority rule procedure has never in the history of Nomenclature Sections been implemented before. Exclusion of the Acacia retypification can be achieved through a democratic process by objecting to its inclusion when the printed (2006) Code comes up for adoption at the start of the Nomenclature Section. This is perfectly within the established process that has been used in past Section meetings. The integrity of the Code will suffer permanent damage if the retypification of Acacia Mill, with a conserved type is not removed from the ICBN, especially as it ended up there through a minority decision.
41317253|Amateur botanists represent an important constituency that makes significant scientific contributions in fields such as biogeography and is the source of important funding for research and conservation issues. We argue that the African amateur botanical constituency has not had a platform to make a contribution to the Acacia retypification debate. We further raise concerns that what we perceive as the failure of the Spermatophyta Committee to adhere to nomenclature guidelines has the potential to undermine nomenclature processes, and the legitimacy of botanical decision-making bodies. It exposes these bodies to accusations of marginalization of Third World countries, especially those in Africa, and has possible legal ramifications, all with the potential to disrupt research and conservation priorities.

41317255|A revised typification of Acrostichum bonariense, based on the cited illustration, is necessary. An epitype is designated to interpret the inadequate original drawing.
41317256|This paper is the second in a series of papers on the nomenclature of the names of genera (Huygh & al., 2010) and subdivisions of genera in Cypereae (Cyperaceae). Here we present a survey of all published names of subdivisions of Cyperus, designate types where needed, and evaluate priority and legitimacy. Cyperus is the largest genus in Cypereae and is the second-largest genus in the family. The high diversity in Cyperus and the complex relationships with its segregate genera resulted in the accumulation of more than 220 names of subdivisions in Cyperus of which 18 are not validly published and 33 are illegitimate.
41317257|Recent molecular studies reveal that Cyperus, the core genus of Cypereae (Cyperaceae), includes several segregate genera. This paper presents a survey of all published names of subdivisions of these segregate genera of Cyperus. It is the third paper in a series of papers on the nomenclature of names of genera and subdivisions of genera in Cypereae. Most names of subdivisions of genera in Cypereae were published in Kyllinga, Mariscus and Pycreus. Types are indicated, being designated where needed, and names are evaluated for their priority and legitimacy. The complex taxonomy of these genera resulted in the accumulation of 79 subdivisional names of which 20 are not validly published and two are illegitimate.
41317258|Current studies in South American Violaceae detected the necessity of neotypes for Viola calceolaria L.( Hybanthus calceolaria (L.) Oken) and Viola oppositifolia L. ( Hybanthus oppositifolius (L.) Taub.), names of species originally described in Loefling's Iter Hispanicum, but without validly published names.
41317259|It is recommended that the listed type of the genus Chlamydomonas be changed from C. pulvinus to C. reinhardtii and that the name Cylindrotheca be conserved against Ceratoneis. It is also recommended that the name Sargassum vulgre not be conserved with a conserved type. The Committee's view on the size of the current ICBN and its method of publication is discussed.
41317260|The following three names are recommended for conservation: Achnanthes brevipes against A. adnata, A. baccillarioides, and A. dubia, and with a conserved type; Sphacelaria with a conserved type; and Dasya, nom. cons, against Rhodonema. As result of reference under Art. 53.5, it is recommended that the genus names Sykidion and Sycidium and all the higher taxa based on these names are not to be considered confusingly similar and thus cannot be treated as (para-) homonyms.
41317261|The following four names of mosses are recommended for conservation: Hypnum molle with a conserved type, Meteorium with a conserved type, Papillaria, nom cons, with a different conserved type, and Rhynchostegium against Eriodon. In addition, conservation of Stirtonia A. L. Sm. (lichenized fungi) against Stirtonia R. Br. bis, already recommended by the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi, is supported. The Committee is unable to make any recommendation on the proposals to conserve Leptodontium proliferum against Tortula umbrosa, and Gertrudia validinervis against Barbula uncinicoma at this stage and is continuing its consideration of these proposals. Two proposals for modification of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature that relate particularly to bryophytes are recommended for acceptance, Art. 9 Prop. H (Taxon Prop. 219) and Div. III Prop. A (338).
41317262|The following eight generic names are recommended for conservation: Caytonia against Laconiella, Cupressinocladus against Libocedrites, Cyclostigma Haught. ex Heer against Cyclostigma Hchst, ex Endl., Danaeopsis Heer ex Schimp, against Marantoidea and Danaeopsis C. Presi, Eusphenopteris Gothan ex Simson-Scharold against Eusphenopteris Kidst., Lepidophloios with that spelling, Pterophyllum with a conserved type, and Schizoneura against Coni'allantes. The following three species names are also recommended for conservation: Podocarpium podocarpum (A. Braun) Herend, against Podocarpium podocarpum (DC.) Y. C. Yang & PH. Huang, Schizoneura paradoxa against Convallarites erecta, and Taeniopteris marantacea with a conserved type.The following four generic names are not recommended for conservation: Angarocarpus with a conserved type, Ephedrites with a conserved type, Genitzia with a conserved type, and Tungussocarpus (nom. illeg.). Two published proposals for conservation of generic names are still under consideration (Pleuromeia with that spelling and Sphenozamites with a conserved type).
41317273|The following three sets of proposals for modification of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature that relate particularly to fossil plants are recommended for acceptance: Gen. Prop. Prop. C, Art. 1 Prop. A & B (Taxon Prop. 101-103), Art.9 Prop. H (219), and Art. 38 Prop. A (192), and the following three sets are not recommended for acceptance: Art. 1 Prop. C & D (175-176), Art. 8 Prop. B, Art. 9 Prop. U, & Art. 38 Prop. C (135-137), and Art. 38 Prop. B (193). In addition the Committee considered a number of proposals of general impact and recommended acceptance of Art. 29 Prop. A-C, Art. 30 Prop. A-B, Art. 31 Prop. A-B, Ree. 29A Prop. A-B, & Ree. 30A Prop. A-B (203-213), the proposals on electronic publication, and Div. Ill Prop. B-C (199-200), but the Committee was undecided on the associated proposals Div. III Prop. D-E (201-202). Although not directly affecting names of fossil plants, the Committee also discussed Art. 36 Prop. A-E (115, 170, 186-188) on the language requirements for the validation of names of new taxa. The members had a positive view of the experience of the restrictive language requirement of either English or Latin for names of fossil plants and would not wish to see a return to allowing any language for validating diagnoses or descriptions.
41317318|Many monotypic genera with unique apomorphic characters have been difficult to place in the morphology-based classifications of the coffee family (Rubiaceae). We rigorously assessed the subfamilial phylogenetic position and generic status of three enigmatic genera, the Seychellois Glionnetia, the Southeast Asian Jackiopsis, and the Chinese Trailliaedoxa within Rubiaceae, using sequence data of four plastid markers (ndhF, rbcL, rps16, trnT-F). The present study provides molecular phylogenetic support for positions of these genera in the subfamily Ixoroideae, and reveals the presence of a basal grade of morphologically distinct, monotypic genera (Crossopteryx, Jackiopsis, Scyphiphora, Trailliaedoxa, and Glionnetia, respectively) in the species-rich Vanguerieae alliance. These five genera may represent sole representatives of their respective lineages and therefore may carry unique genetic information. Their conservation status was assessed, applying the criteria set in IUCN Red List Categories. We consider Glionnetia and Jackiopsis Endangered. Scyphiphora is recognized as Near Threatened despite its extensive range and Crossopteryx as Least Concern. Trailliaedoxa is poorly known (Data Deficient). Finally, the generic status of Glionnetia, Jackiopsis, and Trailliaedoxa and the monogeneric tribe Jackieae as defined by Ridsdale are supported.
41317319|Phylogenetic relationships within Silene sect. Physolychnis are investigated using DNA sequences from two low-copy nuclear regions and three plastid regions. We expand the circumscription of Physolychnis to include also Siberian and Eurasian taxa, with S. zawadzkii and S. uralensis as delimiters of the section. Two main clades are identified within Physolychnis, the Siberian S. ajanensis group and an Asian/American clade. Several taxa, previously classified to sect. Odontopetalae, sect. Occidentales, and sect. Morrisonmontanae, are shown to belong to the Asian/American clade, which otherwise corresponds to Bocquet's (1969) circumscription of sect. Physolychnis. Silene sect. Physolychnis also includes several additional, mainly Asian taxa (e.g., S. davidii, S. seoulensis, S. keiskei, S. viscosa, S. quadriloba, and homoeologues from S. songarica, S. firma, and S. tolmatchevii). Several putative allopolyploids are identified, in several cases stemming from crosses between the two main clades. The two allotetraploids S. involucrata and S. sachalinensis, although morphologically and geographically distinct, have indistinguishable ancestries.
41317320|Fruit morpho-anatomy and DNA sequence diversity in Euro-Mediterranean taxa of Cynoglossum and the closely related genera Solenanthus and Pardoglossum were analysed to assess the structural traits that promote dispersal through transport via the fur of mammals, and to evaluate the phylogenetic value of carpological variation in the group. Electron and light microscopy showed striking epizoochorous adaptations in characters of the pluricellular projections of the epicarp (glochids), such as multiple apical hooks, conical shape, and finely tuberculate surface, as well as the heavy mineralization of the cell walls with especially silicon and calcium revealed by X-ray microanalysis. The attachment potential of nutlets to sheep fleece, estimated through a General Linear Model, was species-specific and relatively high in the taxa with small and light diaspores (>60%). ITS sequences from 29 specific and infraspecific accessions were poorly variable, with pairwise genetic distances ranging from 0.002 to 0.097 (mean 0.044). A comparative analysis of ITS sequence diversity in relation to the different dispersal strategies in the four main Boraginaceae tribes revealed substantially higher levels of variation and interspecific genetic distances in the non-epizoochorous groups, including the Cynoglosseae genera Myosotis and Omphalodes. Bayesian and maximum parsimony tree construction suggested paraphyly of Cynoglossum due to the nested position of Solenanthus apenninus ana Pardoglossum. Species-level relationships remained largely unresolved, preventing an estimation of the phylogenetic significance of fruit characters. Rapid spread across the Mediterranean region via epizoochory by wild mammals is possibly the primary cause for the lack of genetic divergence among species. During the Holocene, nomadic and transhumant pasture by domesticated herbivores has likely contributed to further spreading and mixing of previously isolated taxa, possibly causing events of homoploid hybridization and introgression. More variable molecular markers should be tested to better understand the impact of these processes in the evolutionary history of Cynoglossum and to solve relationships within Cynoglosseae.
41317321|This is the first comprehensive molecular investigation of the genus Lamium L. We have addressed phylogenetic relationships and presumed allopolyploid speciation by use of nuclear (NRPA2, 5S-NTS) and chloroplast (matK, psbA-trnH, rps16, trnL, trnL-F, trnS-G) DNA sequence data. Nuclear and chloroplast data were incongruent, and nuclear data showed better correlation with morphology. Bayesian and parsimony phylogenetic results show that (1) Lamium galeobdolon is sister to all remaining Lamium species; (2) Wiedemannia is nested within Lamium; (3) L. amplexicaule is polyphyletic; (4) most tetraploids are of hybrid origin; (5) L. amplexicaule var. orientale is allotetraploid; and (6) Mennema's (1989) infrageneric classification is not corroborated by molecular data. Based on the molecular results, and taking morphology into account, we suggest resurrection of two species: L. aleppicum and L. paczoskianum.
41317322|Molecular phylogenetic reconstructions have indicated that Haworthia is not monophyletic. Here we show, using considerably expanded datasets of both chloroplast (trnL-trnF and psbA-trnH intergenic spacers) and nuclear (ITS1) markers that the issue of a polyphyletic Haworthia is more complicated than previously reported. Both parsimony and bayesian analyses of cpDNA and ITS1 produced poorly resolved phylogenies, with little or no support for deeper nodes. Species of Haworthia are placed in three of the four main lineages in the cpDNA phylogeny, while in the ITS1 phylogeny Haworthia species were placed in two of the four main lineages retrieved. The cpDNA phylogeny was incongruent with that obtained from the ITS1 data, and the topology of the combined dataset reflected that obtained from the ITS1 dataset. As species of H. subg. Hexangulares and subg. Robustipedunculares have been reportedly involved in intergeneric hybridizations with other Alooideae, it is postulated that a history of ancient hybridization may account for a polyphyletic Haworthia. Hybridization is also ongoing between species within H. subg. Haworthia, and may be responsible for results indicating that some species in this subgenus are not monophyletic. This hybridization may be facilitated by the lack of effective reproductive barriers. We hypothesize that Haworthia is undergoing a contemporary and explosive radiation in southern Africa, driven in part by local adaptation to relatively fine-grained ecological heterogeneity of soils and microclimate.
41317323|The species within Rhododendron sect. Schistanthe (= sect. Vireya), a taxon unique for its tropical habitat, distinctive leaf scales, and tailed seeds, have diversified greatly in morphological features. The section contains over 300 species, occurring mainly on the Malay Peninsula, New Guinea, and the islands between. An analysis based on the combined sequences of three nuclear genes supports a phylogeny in which sect. Schistanthe (less R. santapaui) is monophyletic, with well-defined clades corresponding to subsections Euvireya, Malayovireya, Pseudovireya, and Discovireya. Within subsect. Euvireya, molecular-phylogenetic groupings follow geography more closely than traditional taxonomic groupings based upon morphology. One of the two most derived clades contains exclusively species from New Guinea, Australia, and the Solomon Islands. The results are consistent with a stepwise phylogeographic history of sect. Schistanthe, beginning in Asia, proceeding eastward and reaching New Guinea within the last 15 Ma, when movement of the Australian tectonic plate brought New Guinea into the Malesian domain.
41317324|The Mediterranean and Irano-Turanian biogeographic regions are biodiversity hotspots for mesophytic and xerophytic species, including many Delphinieae. This phylogenetically poorly understood tribe of Ranunculaceae consists of Consolida and Aconitella, with together ca. 52 species, and Delphinium and Aconitum, each with ca. 300 species. To infer the phylogeny of Consolida and Aconitella, we analyzed nuclear and chloroplast DNA sequences from 39 of their species and subspecies (44 taxa) plus a set of 30 exemplar species of Delphinium and Aconitum.We used a Bayesian relaxed clock model to estimate divergence times and a maximum likelihood approach to reconstruct ancestral areas. Aconitella forms a clade embedded in Consolida, and the latter is embedded in Delphinium. Consolida s. l. (including Aconitella) comprises two clades in the Irano-Turanian region and three in the Mediterranean basin. The latter clades' inferred crown ages of 5.1, 4.4, and 2.8 Ma suggests that the repeated drying-up of the Mediterranean, concomitant with and following the Messinian salinity crisis (5.96-5.33 Ma), may have facilitated their westward expansion. While there is clear geographic structure towards the tips of the Consolida s. l. tree, a likely ancestral area could not be inferred. However, the initial diversification of Consolida s. l., which occurred ca.17 Ma ago, falls in a period when the climate in the Anatolian region became more arid, which may have favoured the annual life cycle that characterizes all species in this clade. To achieve a classification of mutually monophyletic genera in Delphinieae may require transferring the species of Aconitella and Consolida into Delphinium.
41317325|Tertiary geological processes and Quaternary climatic oscillations significantly contributed in determining plant species ranges in the Mediterranean basin, making it difficult to distinguish between relative influence of habitat fragmentation and long-distance dispersal in shaping actual species distribution across disjointed regions. We studied the phylogeographic structure of Anacamptis longicomu, a Western Mediterranean orchid species spanning over the main continental islands (Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Balearic Islands) and North Africa. We aimed to answer the question whether the highly disjointed distribution of this orchid was determined by: (1) recent over-sea dispersion after the last glacial phase; (2) range fragmentation after the refilling of Mediterranean basin at the end of the Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC); (3) ancient dispersal events linked to the insurgence of favourable bioclimatic conditions in the basin. Haplotype differentiation, haplotype network, and mismatch analysis support the hypothesis that the current distribution of A. longicomu is more likely explained by allopatric separation and restricted gene flow in connection with fragmentation of a continuous range or a series of ancient dispersal events, after the MSC but before the most recent glaciations. Recent over-sea dispersion, if occurring, must have played a marginal role.
41317326|The systematic utility of sequences from two non-coding regions of plastid DNA, psbA-trnH and trnS-trnG, and one nuclear region, nrlTS, was examined in an assessment of phylogenetic relationships among Neotropical sections of Bulbophyllum Thouars (Orchidaceae, Epidendroideae, Dendrobieae). The nrlTS region was 6 to 7 times more variable than the two cpDNA regions. No major incongruencies between the nuclear and cpDNA datasets were detected. The combined analysis revealed a well-resolved phylogeny at sectional level based on both maximum parsimony and Bayesian approaches. Six sections of Bulbophyllum are recognized for the Neotropics. Five of these were pre-existent but needed to be recircumscribed and one is proposed as new. We did not find disagreements between maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses, but the latter showed better resolved relationships between the sections, which are supported by morphological features. Of the two main clades of Neotropical Bulbophyllum species, one has two lineages and occurs predominantly north of the Equator. The second contains four lineages which are highly diverse in southeastern Brazil. Our results suggest a single colonization event in the Neotropics, from Africa to northern South America, followed by dispersion through the Andes to southeastern Brazil.
41317327|Ifloga and Trichogyne constitute a small but biologically interesting lineage within the tribe Gnaphalieae (Asteraceae).Species are distributed mainly in the semi-arid parts of southern Africa, but there is a disjunction to the Saharo-Sindian region where three species occur. Due partly to an unusual capitulum structure, the phylogenetic position of the group has been little understood. In addition, the monophyly of the genera has not been assessed using phylogenetic methods. A species-level phylogenetic hypothesis is presented, based on one nuclear and two chloroplast DNA regions, analysed with parsimony and Bayesian methods. Ifloga + Trichogyne constitute the "Ifloga clade" that forms one of the early-diverging lineages within Gnaphalieae.These lineages constitute a basal grade with many poorly supported nodes, precluding robust hypotheses of relationships amongst the lineages. A sister lineage to the Ifloga clade could thus not be identified, although it diverges amongst taxa formerly united in subtribe Relhaniinae. Although this subtribe is now known to be non-monophyletic, members of the Ifloga clade share with former members of Relhaniinae a previously overlooked set of leaf characters. The genus Trichogyne is monophyletic, but Ifloga is paraphyletic with respect to Trichogyne. To retain generic monophyly, all species are here transferred to the genus Ifloga.Although two of the Northern-Hemisphere species were not included in the analysis, morphological characters suggest that the three species from this region are monophyletic, in which case the Saharo-Sindian distribution is the result of a single dispersal northwards from Southern Africa. A new combination and an updated key to the species are presented.
41317328|Flowers of most Tofieldiaceae are inserted laterally in the axils of well-developed flower-subtending bracts in a racemose inflorescence, each flower possessing a characteristic calyculus. The monospecific genus Harperocallis, which is endemic to north-western Florida, represents the only member of Tofieldiaceae with a consistently solitary terminal flower.We compare flowers ofH. flava with those of Isidrogalvia, a putative close relative of Harperocallis from South America. We analyse the resulting data in an extended morphological analysis for the entire family. Both Harperocallis and Isidrogalvia lack septal nectaries, which are functionally replaced by tuberculate glands on the ovary walls; in both genera the carpels are united with congenital carpel fusion at the gynoecium base. Flowers of both genera are relatively large and highly vascularized; the calycular phyllomes and tepals each possess several veins and the carpels contain (in addition to dorsal and ventral bundles) both lateral bundles and separate placental bundles that support massive intrusive placentae. The presence of a synascidiate zone with congenital intercarpellary fusion in both genera is correlated with the formation of heterocarpellary ventral bundles. Harperocallis is unusual in that the stamens are often supplied by three veins. Our morphological cladistic analysis supports earlier molecular data indicating a close relationship between Harperocallis and Isidrogalvia, and several morphological characters are revealed as synapomorphies of this sister-pairing. This finding, resulting from strong morphological similarities between Harperocallis and Isidrogalvia, allows the transfer of H. flava into Isidrogalvia.
41317329|The family Compositae has ca. 25,000 species and is estimated to have diverged approximately 45 Ma. Within the family, the small subfamily Barnadesioideae (91 spp.) is the sister group of the rest of Compositae. Four of its nine genera have only one species; one of these, Fulcaldea, is restricted to northern Peru and Ecuador as is its sister group, Arnaldoa (3 spp.). A new species, Fulcaldea stuessyi, is described from the Chapada Diamantina of Bahia, Brazil, a remarkable 4000 km disjunction.The new species is clearly a member of Fulcaldea sharing a number of important characters with the type, F. laurifolia, including a single-flowered capitulum, "plumose" pappus, shrubby habit, and style with a unique swelling. It is distinguished from that species by its red corolla and pappus, greater number of series of phyllaries, and much greater length of the corolla, style, and pappus. The location of the new taxon may be the result of vicariance or long-distance dispersal; it is named in honor of Professor Tod Stuessy.
41317330|A population of Smilax found in southeastern Yunnan was originally considered to be a local race of S. riparia with unusual woody, perennial stems, but its status as a distinct species is supported here by morphology, karyology, and molecular phylogenetics. This new species, Smilax ligneoriparia C. X. Fu & P. Li, shares several unique morphological characteristics with S. riparia, such as ovate herbaceous leaves and smooth stem lacking prickles, but its stem is "woody" and its chromosome number is 2n = 32, unlike that of S. riparia (2n = 30). Molecular phylogenetic analysis also confirms that it is distinct, but tentatively supports the position of this new taxon as sister to a clade of woody Asian species, which in turn is sister to the herbaceous, annually emergent Smilax clade. Herbarium specimens show that S. ligneoriparia has been collected in at least three locations in southeastern Yunnan and southern Zhejiang Provinces, but we suspect that the population from Xichou, occurring on limestone mountain slopes at 1550-1600 m, may be the only extant population.
41317331|There has been confusion among taxonomists regarding the subfamilial placement of Merxmuellera papposa, M. rangei, and four species of Centropodia even though many researchers have included them in molecular studies. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis of 127 species using seven plastid regions (rps3, rps16-trnK, rpslo, rpl32-trnL, ndhF, ndhA, matK) to infer the evolutionary relationships of Centropodia, M. papposa, and M. rangei with other grasses. Merxmuellera papposa and M. rangei form a clade that is sister to three species of Centropodia, and together they are sister to the remaining tribes in Chloridoideae. We provide the carbon isotope ratios for four species indicating that Merxmuellera papposa and M. rangei are photosynthetically C , and Centropodia glauca and C. mossamdensis are C . We present evidence in favor of the expansion of subfamily Chloridoideae to include a new tribe, Centropodieae, which includes two genera, Centropodia and a new genus, Ellisochloa with two species, Ellisochloapapposa and E. rangei.The name Danthoniapapposa Nees is lectotypified.
41317332|Moranopteris, a new genus of grammitid ferns here described, is segregated from Micropolypodium on the basis of molecular phylogenetic analyses (plastid sequences including atpB, rbcL, and trnL-trnF) and morphological characters.Bayesian and maximum parsimony analyses support Moranopteris as sister clade to a group that includes Micropolypodium s.str. and 11 or 12 other genera, mostly from the Old World. A morphological synapomorphy for the species of Moranopteris is the presence of minute and slightly catenate branched hairs (with or without a setiform branch) and sometimes unbranched hairs occurring together on the stipes, costae, and laminar tissues abaxially. In contrast, Micropolypodium s.str. has only minute, catenate, and unbranched hairs borne on the same parts of the leaves. The new genus Moranopteris comprises 28 speciesincluding two new species here described, M. rupicola and M. simplexand one hybrid, occurring in the Neotropics.The 27 necessary new combinations are here proposed. Our results suggest that Micropolypodium is confined to eastern Asia.
41317333|The classification of Bruniaceae is reviewed based on molecular (matK, ITS, rbcL) and morphological data, and the tribes and genera are redefined as monophyletic, morphologically diagnosable lineages. The family is subdivided into three tribes and six genera with 81 accepted species, Linconieae (Linconia), Audouinieae (Audounia [inch Tittmannia], Thamnea [incl. Pseudobaeckea teres]), and Brunieae (Berzelia [inch Brunia p. p.], Staavia [incl. Raspalia staavioides], and Brunia [incl.Nebelia, Pseudobaeckea p. p., Raspalia p. p., Lonchostoma, Mniothamned]). A key for the new classification, a short description of each genus and an updated nomenclature of all the species are provided. Two new tribes are described and thirty-eight new combinations and names are provided.
41317334|Sequence data from the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region were used to determine the tribal placements of the previously unassigned genera Ivania, Scoliaxon, and Phravenia (gen. nov.; named in honor of Dr. Peter H. Raven).The utilization of the ITS-based phylogenetic tribal backbone of Brassicaceae placed three genera in relation to the 44 recognized tribes in the family. Scoliaxon, although showing remarkable morphological similarities to Asta (Asteae), formed an independent clade with 100% bootstrap (BS) support in the tribal analysis, whereas both Ivania and Phravenia clustered with the Thelypodieae clade (96% BS support). In a second and more comprehensive analysis of Thelypodieae, both species of Ivania formed a clade with 61% BS support within the tribe and were affiliated to other Thelypodieae genera from the Southern Hemisphere. The monospecific Phravenia (P. viereckii, formerly ArabislDryopetalon viereckii) formed a clade with 74%-76% bootstrap support within Thelypodieae, and its species did not resolve with Dryopetalon or Sibara in which it had been previously assigned. The present findings support the placement of Ivania and Phravenia in Thelypodieae, as well as the recognition of the new genus Phravenia and new tribe Scoliaxoneae, both of which are formally described herein.
41317335|Parashorea chinensis Wang Hsie and Parashorea chinensis var. kwangsiensis Lin Chi (Dipterocarpaceae) are economically and ecologically important tree taxa in China and Vietnam. Their authorship should be "Wang Hsie" and "Lin Chi", respectively, which represent two logograms of working groups that existed in the particular circumstances from the 1960s to the 1970s in China. The author of Parashorea chinensis has sometimes been designated inappropriately as H. Wang. We herein discuss in detail these two unique cases in the context of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature.
41317336|At least 41 names of Chinese seed plants from 17 families were not validly published in their original publications because the type was not indicated in accordance with one or more of the requirements of Art. 37. They are validated in A Catalogue of Type Specimens (Cormophyta) in the Herbaria of China and its two supplements edited by Shu-Ying Jin and Yi-Lin Chen (1994, 1999,2007). However, most of botanists were presumably unaware of these validations. As it is necessary to know this information when using these names in subsequent publications, the correct citation of the 41 names is provided here.
41317337|Luigi Buscalioni published 119 names of species and infraspecific taxa of Saurauia in many installments over a 16-year period from 1912 and 1927. Buscalioni's work had formal taxonomic sections, which he likely intended as place of valid publication for his names. Nevertheless, most of his names were published with diagnostic or descriptive information in many parts of his works, often earlier than his formal descriptions. The citations of names in Buscalioni's work are summarized, and dates and citations for validation of names are provided.
41317338|Supposed homonyms in Thunberg's Prodromus Plantarum Capensium (2 parts, 1794 & 1800) and N. L. Burman's Prodromus Florae Capensis, published in 1768, are interpreted as Thunberg's applications of Burman names rather than illegitimate later published names. Examples are discussed from the Cape genera Lobostemon Lehm, and Echiostachys Levyns, treated under Echium L. by Burman and Thunberg. Five of twelve Echium names of Thunberg copy those of Burman and are regarded as merely his applications of Burman names known to him from literature, correspondence and personal encounters.Typifications are published for two Burman and six Thunberg names. Type specimens were identified in G, LD, MEL and UPS-THUNB.
41317339|The new species names Mairia petiolata, Zyrphelis capensis, Z. glabra, Z. glandulosa, Z. grauii, Z. macrocarpa, Z. nervosa, Z. spathulata, the new subspecies names Mairia hirsuta subsp.robusta, Zyrphelis ecklonis subsp.oligocephala, Z. ecklonis subsp. strictifolia, Z. microcephala subsp. foliosa, Z. microcephala subsp. glandulosa and the new combinations Zyrphelis ciliaris, Z. ciliaris subsp. angustifolia, Z. ciliaris subsp. hirsuta, Z. decumbens, Z. fruticosa, Z. gracilis, Zyrphelis sect. Gymnostephium, Z. leiocarpa, Z. levis, Z. montana, Z. monticola, and Z. outeniquae are validly published. These names originally appeared in the Ph. D. thesis of the second author, Ursula Zinnecker-Wiegand, submitted to the University of Munich, Germany, in 1990. Being printed and distributed to over 50 libraries, this thesis met the formal requirements for effective publication of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature then in force, but it is no longer effectively published as a result of a retroactive change in the rules adopted at the International Botanical Congress in Vienna in 2005. As result, the new names appearing in the thesis were not validly published and they are validated here.
41317340|The following specific names are recommended for conservation: Olivea tectonae (T. S. Ramakr. & K. Ramakr.) R. L. Mulder against O. tectonae (Racib.) Thirum.; Craterellus cinereus (Pers. : Fr.) Donk with a conserved type against Craterellus cinereus Pers.; Botrytis brongniartii Sacc. with a conserved type; Buellia subcanescens against B. leptina, Lichen flavicans Sw.against Liehen flavicans Lam.; and it is recommended that Cortinarius speciosissimus not be conserved against rubellus. Conservation of Boletus applanatus against B. lipsiense, reconsidered in light of a published rebuttal, remains strongly recommended. The withdrawn proposal to conserve the name Aspiciliafarinosa with a conserved type is removed from further consideration. In light of an even split on three ballots, the proposal to conserve Agaricus rachodes with that spelling is referred to the General Committee for a final decision. Finally, the Committee notes the need for the correction of" Lecidea euphorea (Flrke) Nyl.", nom. cons. (1858) to L. euphorea (Flrke) Sommerf. (1826) to reflect an earlier combination.
41317341|The following two names of bryophytes are proposed for conservation: Cheilolejeunea against Omphalanthus and Distichophyllum with a conserved type.

Paris 1754-1760 by Steinwehr of pre-1753 works be added to Appendix VI. After two ballots, no vote of 11 either for or against proposals to conserve Beccariella or to reject Artemisia aethiopica has been obtained.
41317530|Morphological complexity tends to increase at a macroevolutionary scale among land plants, but reversals or loss of previously acquired complex traits occurs across various lineages and in particular in bryophytes. In mosses reduction may pertain to the leafy gametophyte and the architecture of the sporophyte, and is often considered linked to shifts in habitats. Reduction in morphological complexity may obscure the phylogenetic affinities of the taxa, in particular when multiple derived characters are lost. Ephemeraceae comprise two genera, Ephemerum and Micromitrium, growing typically on disturbed, seasonally moist soils. The hypothesis of a shared ancestry of these genera is drawn from the similarities in their highly reduced morphologies: their ephemeral gametophytes are tiny, bearing few leaves composed of typically smooth cells, and their capsules lack a differentiated lid and are nearly sessile. The family was historically included in Funariidae, but recent phylogenetic inferences revealed that Ephemeraceae likely arose within Dicranidae and may be of polyphyletic origin. Phylogenetic inferences based on eight loci confirm that both genera belong to Dicranidae, and reconstructions of the familial relationships within this subclass corroborate the independent origins of the ephemeral life history and associated character losses, with Ephemerum diverging from a pottiaceous ancestor and Micromitrium sharing a unique common ancestor with Leucobryaceae (Dicranales). Micromitrium is thus excluded from Ephemeraceae and accommodated within its own newly described family Micromitriaceae. This study strengthens the hypothesis that homoplasy is recurrent throughout the evolutionary history of bryophytes and that phylogenetic inferences from DNA sequences are essential to test the systematic concepts based on morphological characters, and particularly in cases of taxa with the most simple architectures and life histories.
41317531|We present the first multi-gene phylogeny of taxa potentially allied to the fern genus Adiantopsis, one of about 20 genera in the large group of cheilanthoid ferns. Our goals were to clarify natural relationships, examine generic boundaries, and interpret character evolution within a phylogenetic framework. Phylogenetic analysis of combined plastid rbcL and atpA DNA sequences has led to an expansion of generic boundaries in Adiantopsis, a recircumscription that is clearly defensible with morphological data. Biogeographic analyses suggest an origin for the genus in South America, with a minimum of three migrations into the Caribbean. We include a synopsis of the genus and two new combinations.
41317532|The Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR) of southern Africa is characterised by large, endemic radiations of flowering plants, the so-called 'Cape Clades', but it is unknown whether such radiations are also found in non-angiosperms. We hypothesise that GCFR-endemic lineages exist in the xeric adapted cheilanthoid ferns. To test this hypothesis with special emphasis on the alternative hypothesis of frequent colonization, the phylogenetic relations, divergence times, and ancestral areas of the cheilanthoid ferns of the GCFR and adjacent regions are investigated. The dataset includes 22 cheilanthoid fern species occurring in the GCFR. With two exceptions, all GCFR-endemics are part of two clades that diversified in the Afro-Madagascan region. The GCFR-endemics are further concentrated in three high-endemism subclades that did not originate simultaneously, but within the timeframe of angiosperm Cape Clades diversification. According to ancestral area reconstructions the ancestors of the two larger Afro-Madagascan clades were likely GCFR-endemic, and a substantial part of the diversification history of these clades took place in the GCFR. The high diversity of cheilanthoids in the GCFR appears to stem primarily from in situ diversification, not from immigration. This pattern resembles the numerous radiations of angiosperm clades in the GCFR, and may be caused by the same factors. We did not find evidence for rapid, synchronised radiations as documented for some, albeit not all, angiosperm Cape Clades. High diversification within and dispersal out of the GCFR has likely enriched cheilanthoid diversity in the Afro-Madagascan region.
41317533|To test earlier hypotheses on the evolutionary origins of European polyploid Dryopteris, their phylogenetic relationships are investigated using nuclear pgiC and plastid trnL-F sequence data. The nuclear pgiC region is for the first time used successfully in phylogenetic analyses of ferns, and is shown to provide appropriate variability to address species-level questions in Dryopteris. The trnL-F dataset is used to infer maternal relationships for the allopolyploid species and provides strong support for some of the smaller clades resolved by pgiC. Allopolyploid origins of Dryopteris carthusiana, D. cristata, and D. guanchica are supported and some, but not all, progenitors are indicated by the analyses. The results are in disagreement with the "D. semicristata" hypothesis proposed by several authors. The allopolyploid origin of D. crispifolia remained unresolved and allopolyploid origins of D. dilatata and D. filix-mas were unsupported. This study provides the first insight in the molecular phylogeny of the diploid D. fragrans, which shows major genetic variation within the only European population of the species.
41317534|Thymus herba-barona is endemic to Majorca, Corsica, and Sardinia. In order to gain insight into its evolutionary history, we examined the genetic diversity and phylogeography of the species using sequences of the trnT-trnL intergenic spacer from 106 individuals belonging to 15 populations. We detected high within-species genetic diversity and strong among-population differentiation, but no evidence for phylogeographic structure. A haplotype network supported the occurrence of three main clades, the ancestral one being geographically restricted to the Gennargentu massif in Sardinia, while the two derived ones were relatively widespread. Coalescent-based analyses indicated deep divergence times and limited ongoing gene flow between major clades. The inferred evolutionary history of the species involved an early range expansion followed by successive fragmentation episodes, probably related to progressive climatic aridification since the Pliocene (3.2 Ma). Our data suggest that long-distance dispersal events played a minor role in the evolutionary history of the species. The exact origin of the species remains unclear. The highly structured pattern of genetic variability detected suggests that random genetic drift played a major role in structuring genetic variation in this endemic plant. The cytogenetic evidence does not support the proposed recognition of three taxonomic entities within T. herba-barona based on morphological discontinuities associated with different ploidy levels.
41317535|The 21 wild species of Phalaris L. (Poaceae) are distributed in temperate areas of both hemispheres and in the mountains of tropical Africa and South America. The genus contains annual and perennial diploids based on x = 6 and 7 and polyploids based on x = 7, with the x = 6 cytotypes displaying less species diversification. Phalaris presents a potentially valuable case study for speciation in conjunction with chromosomal evolution and biogeography in Poaceae due to its global distribution, notable variation in morphological traits, and the key role of polyploidy in its evolution. We reconstructed the first phylogenetic tree for the genus using nuclear ITS and plastid trnT-F sequences to assess species relationships and map trends in floret differentiation and patterns of polyploid evolution. The study demonstrated a single origin of the x = 6 chromosome number and revealed the sister relationship of this lineage to the monophyletic x = 7 lineage. The clades recovered in the analyses display geographic affiliations and demonstrate diploid-polyploid associations. A trend in sterile lemma reduction is evident, with members of the early diverging x = 6 lineage displaying relatively large and lanceolate sterile lemmas, followed by gradual reduction in size, culminating in almost obsolete sterile lemmas in one of the terminal x = 7 clades.
41317536|Phylogenetic analyses of the subtribe Hyptidinae (Lamiaceae) based on nuclear ITS and ETS, and plastid trnL-F, trnS-G, trnD-T, and matKare presented. The analysis of the ITS dataset included 218 specimens representing 180 species of Hyptidinae. This analysis was used to select a smaller representative sample of 69 species of Hyptidinae for further analysis based on all above regions. The monophyly of Hyptidinae and almost all genera is well-supported, with noticeable paraphyly of Hyptis which is ancestor of all remaining genera of Hyptidinae. Eriope is monophyletic with the exclusion of E. simplex, while Hypenia represents a monophyletic group excluding H. vitifolia. Hyptis eximia was shown to be associated with Hyptidendron, and Peltodon is embedded within the Hyptis s. str. clade. Internal relationships within Hyptis s. str. were not completely resolved; a preliminary discussion on the taxonomy treatment of the complex and the subdivision of Hyptis are presented.
41317537|An evaluation of the taxonomic status and phylogenetic position of the monotypic genus Urocarpidium Ulbr. (Malvaceae) was undertaken using DNA sequence data. Nuclear (ITS 1 and 2) and plastid (ndhF, rpllo intron, 3' matK-trnK intron) sequence data were used to reconstruct independent phylogenies for related genera of tribe Malveae, to which Urocarpidium belongs. The nuclear and plastid phylogenies indicate that Urocarpidium albiflorum is not synonymous with Tarasa operculata as previously suggested, consistent with earlier phylogenetic studies. Instead, this species is more closely related to Fuertesimalva and Palaua, although its position relative to these two genera differs in the nuclear and plastid trees. Given the unresolved phylogenetic position and unique suite of morphological characters, Urocarpidium is maintained as a monotypic genus. Full synonymy for Urocarpidium albiflorum is also provided.
41317538|In order to reexamine the taxonomic coherence of Tofieldia nuda, which shows wide morphological variation within the species, we analysed sequences of plastid trnK, trnL, and trnL-F and nuclear ITS of T. nuda and seven further species of Tofieldia. We found that T. nuda contains three different lineages supported with 99% or 100% bootstrap value: one sister to T. coccinea (100%), one linage sister to the Chinese species T. divergens and T. thibetica (98%100%), and a third lineage sister to the second lineage plus T. divergens and T. thibetica (99%-100%). As the wide morphological gaps among T. nuda, T. coccinea, T. divergens, and T. thibetica prevent us from considering them as conspecific with one the three lineages of T. nuda are regarded as different at the species level. The first lineage corresponds to T. nuda s. str., the second to T. furusei (formerly T. nuda var. furusei), and the third to T. yoshiiana, often considered a synonym of T. nuda. Tofieldia yoshiiana is further divided into three varieties, var. yoshiiana, var. kanwonensis comb. nov. and var. hyugaensis var. nov. A key to the three species and varieties is provided.
41317539|A phylogenetic analysis of the genus Colchicum (including Bulbocodium and Merendera) is presented. The phylogeny includes all but four of the 100 species and all subspecies currently recognized in the genus, two insufficiently known species (C. mirzoevae, C. stenopetalum), and one cultivated specimen (C. laetum hort.) probably of hybrid origin. The analysis is based on 292 parsimony-informative characters derived from nucleotide sequences from six plastid regions (trnL intron, trnL-trnF IGS, trnY-trnD IGS, trnH-psbA IGS, atpB-rbcL IGS, rpslo intron) and 33 morphological, life history, and chromosomal characters. The genus Colchicum is strongly supported as monophyletic. The morphological data are considerably more homoplasious than the molecular characters, but provide added resolution to the trees derived from a combined analysis. The phylogenetic hypothesis is largely in conflict with the subgenera and sections recognized by Stefanov, and agrees better with some of the informal species groups defined by Persson in earlier publications. Additional data will be needed to resolve all relationships.
41317540|Salweenia (Leguminosae) has long been defined as a monotypic genus. In this study we carried out comprehensive studies on populations of S. wardii Baker f. across its distribution range. The results showed that this species diverged into two distinct groups: plants from the Yalong Jiang valley have linear leaflets 0.07-0.14 cm wide and relatively flattened legumes, as well as a 2A karyotype asymmetry, whereas plants from the Nu Jiang and Lancang Jiang drainages have lanceolate leaflets 0.20-0.34 cm wide, undulant legumes, and a 1A karyotype asymmetry. Furthermore, molecular phylogenetic analysis of four chloroplast DNA markers (trnL-F, rpl32-trnL, psbA-trnH, trnS-G) recovered two reciprocally monophyletic clades among accessions of plants from these two areas respectively. We therefore recognize individuals of S. wardii in the Yalong Jiang valley as a separate species, S. bouffordiana sp. nov. Salweenia thus contains two allopatrically distributed species and the genus is no longer monotypic. The origin of the disjunction between the two species is briefly discussed and it is hypothesized to have come about through vicariance, resulting of several historic river separations, reversal and capture events estimated to have taken place during the Pleistocene.
41317541|Much work has been done on the endemic floras of Madeira and the Canary Islands but little is known about the origin and diversification of endemic plants of the Cape Verde archipelago. In this study we focus on the three endemic species of the genus Echium L. (Boraginaceae) in Cape Verde. Phylogenetic analyses based on nuclear (ITS1, ITS2) and plastid (trnT-L, trnL-F, rpsl6, psal-accd) DNA markers produced similar topologies that suggest a recent single colonization event in the Cape Verde archipelago, with subsequent diversification during the Pleistocene (< 1.8 Ma). All datasets recovered a split between the "southern" (E. hypertropicum, E. vulcanorum) and "northern" (E. stenosiphon s. l.) island species, and suggest that habitat adaptation and inter-island colonization played a prominent role in the evolution of Echium in Cape Verde. Implications of the results are discussed in the context of the biogeography of the Macaronesian Islands. The northern island species are classified into three distinct subspecies, one for each of the northern islands: E. stenosiphon subsp. stenosiphon endemic to So Vicente, subsp. lindbergii endemic to Santo Anto, and subsp. glabrescens endemic to So Nicolau.
41317542|A new genus of Zingiberaceae from Vietnam, Newmania N.S. L & kornik, with two species Newmania serpens N.S. L & kornik. and N. orthostachys N.S. L & kornik., is described and illustrated. Its relationship with Haniffia Holttum and phylogenetic position in the tribe Zingibereae is investigated using nrlTS and trnK and matK plastid sequence data. The phylogenetic position of Kedhalia C. K. Lim, another recently described ginger genus from the same tribe, is also discussed briefly.
41317543|The phylogeny of the Pantropical tribe Urophylleae is poorly understood. Earlier phylogenetic work has identified major evolutionary lineages within the group, each geographically restricted to a single continent, but relationships among taxa within these lineages are so far largely unresolved. This study uses parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) and nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) to resolve phylogenetic relationships within Urophylleae. The results show that there are conflicts between cpDNA and nrDNA regarding species-level relationships within Pauridiantha, Urophyllum, and Amphidasya, which provides evidence of a complex genetic history. Different types of tests are used to explore the magnitude of the incongruence and locate the exact nodes in the two gene trees that are in conflict. This approach makes it possible to use the topology from the combined analysis, despite the separate datasets being strongly incongruent, since areas of the tree that are free from conflict can be identified. Based on the results presented in this study, Urophylleae is indicated to consist of Temnopteryx, Raritebe, Amphidasya, Urophyllum s. l., Pauridiantha s. l., and Pentaloncha. Several genera are shown to be nested inside Pauridiantha, two of which have already been included in Pauridiantha based on other data (Pamplethantha, Commitheca), and two which are included in this genus here (Poecilocalyx, Stelechanthd). Likewise, three genera are shown to be ingroups in Urophyllum (Pravinaria, Maschalocorymbus, Pleiocarpidid), and are therefore subsumed under this genus. New combinations under Pauridiantha are proposed for three species in Poecilocalyx and three species in Stelechantha, as well as new combinations under Urophyllum for two species in Pravinaria and 17 species in Pleiocarpidia. For one of the latter species a new name is presented to avoid homonymy.
41317544|The genus Polyalthia (Annonaceae) has been demonstrated to be polyphyletic, with the Asian species with columellarsulcate pollen recently segregated to form a new genus, Maasia. The phylogenetic affinities of the other Polyalthia species with columellar-sulcate pollen, which occur in Madagascar, are investigated using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of three chloroplast DNA markers (trnL-F, matK, rbcL). The species are shown to form a well-supported clade which warrants taxonomic recognition as a distinct genus. The name Fenerivia is adopted, considerably expanding the application of this formerly monotypic name, with nine new nomenclatural combinations validated. The genus is hypothesised to have undergone a homeotic mutation in which the outermost whorl of stamens develop as inner petals (presumed andropetals), and the calyx is reduced to a vestigial flange.
41317545|Species identification and analysis of phylogenetic relationships within the genus Typha are difficult because of the high degree of variability among morphological characters and frequent interspecific hybridization. Traditionally, two sections (T. sect. Ebracteolatae and sect. Bracteolatae) have been recognized within the genus based on the presence or absence of braeteoles in the female flowers. The aims of this study were to reconstruct the phylogeny of Typha using DNA sequence data from nuclear LEAFY and three plastid regions, and to evaluate previous classifications. We sampled nine species from various regions that were each invariant at the molecular level. A parsimony consensus tree recovered three clades in the genus: clade I including T. angustifolia, T. elephantina, T. domingensis, and T. capensis; clade II including T. orientalis and T. laxmanni; and clade III comprising T. latifolia and T. shuttleworthii. Typha minima was found sister to the rest of the Typha species with maximal bootstrap support. The results do not support previous classifications of Typha. Character analysis showed that bracteole loss, spatulate stigma, lack of a gap between staminate and pistillate inflorescences, and monad pollen are derived characteristics in Typha.
41317546|Solanum subg. Leptostemonum contains approximately 350-450 species, including the cultivated eggplant, S. melongena. Most species placed in this subgenus form a monophyletic group, the Leptostemonum clade, characterized by the presence of stellate hairs and prickles, leading to the common name of "spiny solanums". Here we present a phylogenetic analysis that circumscribes the major clades within the spiny solanums and examines the relationships among them, with an emphasis on New World species. Of particular interest is the clarification of the clade limits and species composition of groups that have not been well-sampled. We also increase sampling of taxa that have been previously analyzed in molecular studies, namely those in the Torva, Micracantha, and Erythrotrichum clades. These groups have convergent morphological characteristics that have challenged taxonomists, making classification difficult. Results from our study delimit 14 clades within the spiny solanums, including the newly designated Asterophorum, Gardneri, Sisymbriifolium, and Thomasiifolium clades. We also establish the placement of species not previously sampled, especially those endemic to Brazil. These results give an increased understanding of the evolution of the Leptostemonum clade by defining monophyletic groups within it and identify areas of the phylogenetic tree that remain unresolved and require further taxon sampling.
41317547|Microsatellites are robust molecular markers for exploring genetic variability in all organisms, now widely used in plant systematics and evolutionary biology. It is sometimes a drawback, however, that de novo isolation and characterization to obtain working primers for as yet unexamined species are prohibitively time-consuming. Recently, high-throughput sequencing technologies have had a significant impact on many different types of genomic research; they also provide new opportunities for locating microsatellites in non-model and not-previously-sequenced organisms. Here we report results of high-throughput sequencing to identify a large number of microsatellites from six distantly related angiosperm plant species (Acer pseudosieboldianum, Drimys confertifolia, Dystaenia takesimana, Hepatica nobilis var. japonica, Myrceugenia fernandeziana, Rhaphithamnus venustus). Using a combination of a total (non-enrichment) genomic library and small-scale pyrosequencing (1/8 of a PicoTiterPlate) with multiplexing option, we determined 2.57 to 6.23 Mbp of sequence (10,411 to 21,021 reads) in the genomes of the six species and identified 63 to 284 microsatellites that had flanking regions suitable for primer design; we also obtained 1 to 29 microsatellites located in the chloroplast genome. We tested PCR amplification, reproducibility, and level of polymorphism of 42 primer pairs for Acer pseudosieboldianum and 24 for another five species using eight individuals from two populations. As a result, between 46% and 83% of markers were clearly genotyped, and between 17% and 63% efficaciously detected polymorphisms within populations. This method is cost- and time-effective in comparison with traditional approaches involving cloning and sequencing.
41317548|Despite their potential shortcomings for phylogenetic inference, sometimes only morphological data are available for systematic classification. Computational methods are used to determine morphological site patterns congruent with the molecular tree in order to improve the accuracy of the classification of taxa for which only morphological data exist. Here, we used molecular site weight calibration as implemented in RAML to weight morphological characters based on their distribution on a maximum likelihood tree inferred from molecular data. We subsequently conducted morphology-based 'phylogenetic binning' (= assignment of morphologically defined taxa that lack molecular data to branches of the molecular reference tree) based on the morphology of the taxa included in the tree. We applied this methodology to the lichen genus Graphis s.l. (Ascomycota: Ostropales: Graphidaceae), which was recently shown to represent two separate, distantly related lineages, Graphis s.str. and Allographa. Of 313 species of Graphis and Allographa included in the study, 16 were represented by molecular sequence data and morphology, and 297 by morphology only. Using maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony site weight calibration and morphology-based phylogenetic binning, 281-290 of the 297 species represented by morphological data only could be assigned to either Graphis or Allographa with strong support (90%-100%). Two species, G. saxiseda and G. evirescens, were found to represent species of the unrelated genus Carbacanthographis. Our results showed that assignment of taxa to clades based on morphological data only substantially improved with molecular site weight calibration. Both molecular site weight calibration and branch assignment to the molecular reference tree are implemented in the RAML v. 7.2.6 Windows executable and the RAML v. 7.2.8 open-source code.
41317549|Exact publication dates are provided for the first time for Scripta Botanica [ ], the first Russian scientific botanical journal which appeared from 1886 to 1916.
41317550|An alphabetical list of all the validly published names of Brazilian taxa of Bauhinia L. s.str. (= Bauhinia subg. Bauhinia) including those first published in Pauletia Cav. is presented with details of all types including 30 new typifications. All names are assigned to their accepted taxa following the classification for Leguminosae tribe Cercideae published by Lewis & Forest in 2005.
41317551|The typification of the Linnaean name Papaver hybridum is discussed. A specimen in the Burser Herbarium at Uppsala is designated as lectotype.
41317552|Cynoglossum creticum Mill., a name in current usage for a widely distributed Mediterranean species, is neotypified in the apparent absence of original material for the name.
41317553|The currently accepted lectotype (Herb. Linn. No. 629.4, LINN) of Reseda giauca L. is identifiable as the related species, R. virgata Boiss. & Reuter. The specimen, collected by Lfling in central Spain, was not explicitly cited in Linnaeus's protologue, in contrast to a specimen (at UPS) collected by Burser in the Pyrenees and identifiable as R. giauca of usage. In accordance with Art. 9.10 of the ICBN, we reject the choice of 629.4 (LINN) as lectotype and we designate Burser's specimen as the lectotype of R. glauca L. in its place. This type choice maintains the traditional and current usage of this well-known and widely used Linnaean name.
41317554|The currently accepted lectotype of the Linnaean species Spartium scoparium is a specimen of Cytisus arboreus (Desf.) DC. This lectotype is here superseded in favour of another specimen in the Linnaean collection on the grounds of conflict with the protologue. The current name for the species known as Cytisus scoparius (L.) Link can therefore be maintained.
41317555|Euaraliopsis was first published by Hutchinson in 1967 who intended it to be a replacement name for "Araliopsis Kurz", which was not, however, a validly published name. As no Latin diagnosis was provided by Hutchinson, he did not validly publish Euaraliopsis. The name was, however, validly published inadvertently through a descriptiogenerico-specifico when the new species Euaraliopsis moumingensis Y.R. Ling was described. The correct place of publication, authorship and typification are given for all validly published names in Euaraliopsis, generally considered a synonym of Brassaiopsis.
41317556|When treated separately from Epilobium, the group of species with zygomorphic flowers and alternate leaves has the correct generic name Chamaenerion Sg. 1754, and Chamerion (Raf.) Raf. ex Holub 1972 is its later heterotypic synonym. The history of generic treatments and name changes in Epilobium s.l. is briefly discussed, and nomenclatural and type citations are provided.
41317557|The application of the names Croton glabellus, C. lucidus, and Phyllanthus glabellus has been confusing since the earliest publications that used them. After a thorough review of these publications and corresponding herbarium specimens, we clarify the nomenclatural confusion surrounding these names and their taxonomy. We identify a new name, Phyllanthus glabellus Fawc. & Rendle, that was inadvertently made. We make the new combination Croton glabellus subsp. polytrichus, and we designate lectotypes for Astrocasia tremula, Croton subsect. Astraeopsis, C. glandulifer, C. lucidus var. polytrichus, and C. spicatus.
23210267|It remains one of the primary responsibilities of taxonomists to describe and concomitantly disseminate information about the novelties they discover through their research efforts and associated herbarium and field work. However, given the present-day emphasis on benefit sharing concerning access to components of biodiversity, taxonomists should be much more circumspect when conducting field- and other work in foreign countries. It is imperative that project proposals submitted for consideration for support or funding take cognizance of the needs of taxonomists and biodiversity specialists in the countries in which fieldwork is to be conducted.
23210268|The increasing speed and decreasing cost of generating DNA sequence data has transformed experimental approaches in many fields of biology. In this review we describe some of the new technologies commercially available and in development, and discuss how plant taxonomy could benefit from the possible data generated. These benefits include better resolved phylogenies, potential for dealing with the difficulties posed by polyploidy and hybridisation, and new options for studying species boundaries and species relationships in recent radiations.
23210269|The phylogeny of Trametes and related genera was studied using molecular data from ribosomal markers (nLSU, ITS) and protein-coding genes (RPB1, RPB2, TEF1-alpha) and consequences for the taxonomy and nomenclature of this group were considered. Separate datasets with rDNA data only, single datasets for each of the protein-coding genes, and a combined five-marker dataset were analyzed. Molecular analyses recover a strongly supported trametoid clade that includes most of Trametes species (including the type T. suaveolens, the T. versicolor group, and mainly tropical species such as T. maxima and T. cubensis) together with species of Lenzites and Pycnoporus and Coriolopsis polyzona. Our data confirm the positions of Trametes cervina (= Trametopsis cervina) in the phlebioid clade and of Trametes trogii (= Coriolopsis trogii) outside the trametoid clade, closely related to Coriolopsis gallica. The genus Coriolopsis, as currently defined, is polyphyletic, with the type species as part of the trametoid clade and at least two additional lineages occurring in the core polyporoid clade. In view of these results the use of a single generic name (Trametes) for the trametoid clade is considered to be the best taxonomic and nomenclatural option as the morphological concept of Trametes would remain almost unchanged, few new nomenclatural combinations would be necessary, and the classification of additional species (i.e., not yet described and/or sampled for molecular data) in Trametes based on morphological characters alone will still be possible. Alternative scenarios to divide the trametoid clade in five or ten genera were considered but if any of these options were to be adopted morphological distinction of the segregated genera and the ascription of additional species to any of these genera would be very difficult and in some cases impossible. The genera Artolenzites, Coriolopsis (as currently typified), Coriolus, Cubamyces, Cyclomycetella, Lenzites, Poronidulus, Pseudotrametes and Pycnoporus are considered synonyms of Trametes.
23210270|The cosmopolitan genus Ceramium (Ceramiaceae, Rhodophyta) is a large and systematically complex group. The taxonomy of this genus remains in a chaotic state due to the high degree of morphological variation. Culture studies, suggesting a strong influence of environment on phenotype, and the use of molecular tools have recently questioned the validity of morphological features used in species recognition. Here we compare three Ceramium taxa from Venice lagoon with samples from northwest Europe using the plastid ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase gene (rbcL) and the rbcL-rbcS intergenic spacer combined with morphological observations. A strongly banded species, previously identified as member of a poorly understood and misnamed group, the Ceramium diaphanum complex sensu Feldmann-Mazoyer, is probably conspecific with British samples of Ceramium diaphanum sensu Harvey, for which no valid name has been identified up to now. We show that Ceramium polyceras (Ktzing) Zanardini is a valid name for this species. A fully corticated Ceramium species morphologically resembling C. secundatum differs at the species level from Atlantic C. secundatum; a valid name for this entity is Ceramium derbesii Solier ex Ktzing, described from Mediterranean France. A third species characterized by cortical spines, previously listed as Ceramium ciliatum var. robustum (J. Agardh) Mazoyer, is shown to be Ceramium nudiusculum (Ktzing) Rabenhorst, originally described from Venice.
23210271|Relationships among species in Sarmentypnum, and Warnstorfia, are investigated based on the nuclear ITS and the chloroplast markers trnL-trnF, rpl16, and tRNA-Gly of up to 237 specimens. Six specimens in which morphology agrees with ITS sequences have chloroplast markers belonging to other species, whereas in two specimens morphology agrees with the chloroplast markers but have ITS sequences belonging to other species. Although hybridization has been recorded in Sarmentypnum, such incongruence could also be a result of other processes, including rapid morphological differentiation and incomplete lineage sorting. ITS and the chloroplast markers partly agree with the morphological species, although some of the latter appear to be polyphyletic or paraphyletic. Sarmentypnum exannulatum consists of two to three haplotype groups that are connected to S. sarmentosum, but not with each other. Sarmentypnum sarmentosum haplotypes are connected with haplotypes of most other species and may have played a central role in the genus' diversification. The trnL-trnF spacer inversion shows patterns congruent with other chloroplast information; it is therefore clearly informative. The incongruence among mainly non-coding molecular datasets and partial disagreement with morphological species could possibly be attributable to the special history of the boreal to arctic environments where Sarmentypnum is predominantly found. The species must be young in terms of number of generations and have experienced large-scale climatic oscillations during the Pleistocene. Incomplete lineage sorting in combination with rapid morphological evolution that is not reflected in the non-coding markers and an unknown frequency of hybridization most likely explains the observed incongruence.
23210272|Phylogenetic relationships and character evolution in the core Ptychanthoideae (Lejeuneaceae, Marchantiophyta), with a focus on Thysananthus, are assessed based on molecular (plastid psbA-trnH, trnG, trnL-F, trnS-rps4, nrITS), morphological-anatomical, and phytochemical data. Generic relationships are molecularly well-resolved and confirm the placement of Mastigolejeunea pancheri and the monotypic Dendrolejeunea fruticosa in Thysananthus. Most morphological characters currently used to distinguish genera in Ptychanthoideae are homoplastic according to ancestral state reconstruction. Molecular and phytochemical data suggest the occurrence of polyphyletic species in Thysananthus and Mastigolejeunea. Careful study of the polyphyletic taxa revealed morphological differences between some of the intraspecific clades, which correlated with synonymized or novel species. Incongruence between plastid and ITS data in M. pancheri indicated the occurrence of a putative hybrid, the first one recorded in Lejeuneaceae and the first in liverworts inferred from phylogenetic data.
23210273|With approximately 200 species, the genus Radula is one of the most speciose genera of leafy liverworts. Although the genus is well delimited, its subdivision into subgenera and sections has been controversial. None of the subgeneric subdivisions have been the subject of an explicit test of internal consistency or monophyly based on molecular data and a comprehensive view of evolutionary relationships within the genus is thus still lacking. In the present paper we propose, based on a molecular phylogeny of the genus, a new subgeneric classification for Radula, and create three new subgenera. While the reconstructions of ancestral gametophytic characters allow for a morphological description of each of the seven lineages identified in our phylogeny, synapomorphies for these lineages are mostly lacking. Uncertainty of morphological state reconstructions at the deepest nodes of the phylogeny, which point to a rapid morphological diversification of the genus in its early history, do not allow for pinpointing when morphological changes occurred. The classification scheme proposed here is therefore mostly based on molecular features.
23210274|The spores of the monospecific genus Hattorioceros are ovoid to spheroid with canaliculate-striate surface ornamentation, and are unique among hornworts. We determine here for the first time the phylogenetic position of the genus using sequence data from the chloroplast rbcL and mitochondrial nad5 genes. Hattorioceros is nested within Phaeoceros, challenging its taxonomic status. Although spore morphology is a key feature in hornwort taxonomy, our results suggest that caution must be taken when describing taxa above the species level based solely on a single character.
23210275|The aim of the present study was to infer a substantially larger, more evenly sampled, phylogenetic tree for Caryophyllaceae in order to more confidently resolve relationships within this clade. This would allow us to evaluate previous classification schemes and to infer the evolution of a number of characters that have figured prominently in higher-level taxonomic treatments. We have inferred a 630-tip phylogeny (ca. 30% of the 2200 species) using maximum likelihood analyses of data from the nuclear ribosomal ITS region and five chloroplast genes and intergenic spacers: matK, ndhF, trnL-trnF, trnQ-rps16, and trnS-trnfM. Our results confirm that subfamily Paronychioideae is paraphyletic at the base of Caryophyllaceae. Alsinoideae and Caryophylloideae together form a clade, within which neither subfamily is monophyletic. With only a few exceptions, our results support the tribal classification presented by Harbaugh & al. (2010). In agreement with other recent studies, it appears that many of the larger genera are not strictly monophyletic. Our results imply that the first Caryophyllaceae had stipules, free sepals, small apetalous flowers with few stamens, and single-seeded indehiscent or irregularly dehiscing utricles. Stipules were lost along the branch to the Alsinoideae-Caryophylloideae clade, and the evolution of a tubular calyx marks Caryophylloideae. The evolution of petals, 10 stamens, and capsule fruits is inferred to have taken place along the branch subtending a clade that includes Sperguleae (mostly containing former members of Paronychioideae) and the remainder of Caryophyllaceae. As this previously unnamed major group is both well-supported in molecular phylogenetic studies and marked by clear-cut apomorphies, we propose the name Plurcaryophyllaceae for this clade and provide a phylogenetic definition.
23210276|Genera included in Polygoneae such as Atraphaxis, Duma, Fallopia, Muehlenbeckia, Polygonella, Polygonum, Oxygonum, and Reynoutria are investigated using a molecular framework. Previous morphological studies had indicated that Polygonum is composed of sections Duravia, Polygonum, and Pseudomollia with the genus Polygonella included as a subsection of Polygonum sect. Duravia. One nuclear (nrITS) and three chloroplast (matK, ndhF, trnL-trnF) regions were analyzed with Maximum Parsimony and Maximum Likelihood methods to address evolutionary relationships within the tribe. The results show that Polygoneae is composed of three main clades: Knorringia as sister to all other taxa within Polygoneae, a clade of Reynoutria and Fallopia+Muehlenbeckia, and their sister clade of Atraphaxis, Duma, and Polygonum. The currently accepted sections within Polygonum are recovered and Polygonum sect. Duravia is sister to sections Polygonum and Pseudomollia. With Polygonella included in Polygonum, the appropriate new combinations and names are proposed. In addition, a few species of Polygonum are transferred to Atraphaxis. Oxygonum is not supported as a member of Polygoneae and its exact position awaits additional data.
23210277|Despite being a speciose component of the Cape Floristic Region at the southern tip of Africa, the southern African Oxalis lineage is systematically poorly understood. Palynological and preliminary phylogenetic studies of the group contrast with the current taxonomy, and indicate the need for further research. Here we present a large-scale phylogenetic analysis comprising 150 of 210 southern African species, sampled for plastid trnL-F and trnS-G and nuclear ITS markers, using three different inference methods. Secondly, we explore the origins of southern African Oxalis as a potential Cape clade. Despite substantial localised incongruence between plastid and nuclear datasets, analyses agreed on a monophyletic southern African clade, which consists of two species-poor and one extremely species-rich lineages. The current taxonomy is shown to be artificial, with not one section retrieved as monophyletic. Our topologies are consistent with previous palynological and phylogenetic studies, and provide a backbone for future systematic work. Reconstructions of ancestral area for the southern African lineage support an origin within or close to the Cape Floristic Region.
23210278|A new Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains endemic genus, Parasyncalathium J.W. Zhang, Boufford & H. Sun (Asteraceae, Cichorieae, Lactucinae) is described. Parasyncalathium is based on Syncalathium souliei (Franch.) Y. Ling, originally placed in Lactuca sect. Aggregatae Franch., as L. souliei Franch., then later moved to Syncalathium Lipschitz. Previous published evidence from cytology, molecular phylogeny, and morphology, and especially SEM of cypsela morphology in the present study confirm the difference between Syncalathium souliei and Syncalathium s.str., the latter including the type species of the genus, S. kawaguchii (Kitam.) Y. Ling. Syncalathium s.str. should be placed in subtribe Crepidinae (Asteraceae, Cichorieae); S. souliei, although distinct from other members of the subtribe, remains in Lactucinae where it groups within Lactuca s.l. in the tree topology.
23210279|A new Begonia species from Laos and Thailand is described. It belongs to Begonia sect. Tetraphila, along with 30 other species which are all endemic to Africa. This is the first record of any of the 65 currently accepted sections in Begonia transgressing continental borders. A dated molecular phylogeny places the split of the new Asian species from its African congeners during the late Miocene to the early Pleistocene. As the species is a hygromesophilous epiphyte limited to tropical forest, no suitable corridor for migration existed during that time and the cause of the Afro-Asian disjunction probably is a long-distance dispersal event. The discovery of B. afromigrata emphasises the importance of chance in the assembly of tropical floras.
23210280|The phylogenetic relationships between Paraboea, Trisepalum and Phylloboea, in the twisted-fruited clade of the advanced Asiatic and Malesian Gesneriaceae, were investigated using nuclear and chloroplast data. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference analyses demonstrated unambiguously that the three genera originated from a single common ancestor, that Phylloboea is nested deeply in Trisepalum and that in turn Trisepalum is nested in Paraboea. As Paraboea has been conserved against Phylloboea and Trisepalum the necessary new combinations in Paraboea are made here. The enlarged genus Paraboea comprises around 120 species. The phylogeny presented here will provide a valuable framework for future biogeographic and comparative studies in Gesneriaceae.
23210281|Historically, there has been taxonomic confusion among agrostologists regarding the short-spikeleted Stipeae. We refer to these as the Oryzopsis/Piptatherum complex which consists of short-spikeleted species with coriaceous to cartilaginous and often caducous-awned lemmas, and florets with a blunt callus. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis of 53 species that have been associated with this complex using four plastid regions (ndhF, rpl32-trnL, rps16-trnK, rps16 intron) in combination with lemma micromorphology to infer evolutionary relationships. Piptatherum as currently circumscribed is polyphyletic and is found in five strongly supported clades in our maximum likelihood tree. Based on our phylogenetic and morphological evidence we recognize a Eurasian Piptatherum s.str., propose a new genus, Piptatheropsis, to include five North American species, and resurrect the genus Patis to include three species, two from Eurasia and one from North America. We provide morphological descriptions of Patis, Piptatherum, and Piptatheropsis, and provide keys to the genera and species of the Oryzopsis/Piptatherum complex. The following new combinations are made: Patis obtusa, Patis racemosa, Piptatheropsis canadensis, Piptatheropsis exigua, Piptatheropsis micrantha, Piptatheropsis pungens, Piptatheropsis shoshoneana, Piptatherum brachycladum, and Piptatherum kopetdagense.
23210282|We use a relatively densely sampled phylogeny to obtain preliminary estimates for the ages of the major clades identified in Euphorbia, with which we show that the succulent species of Euphorbia have diversified over the last 36 million years into many of the semi-arid, tropical parts of the world. Many major clades have subclades from widely separated regions, often on different continents. Our results imply that these distributions arose by long-distance dispersal after the break-up of Gondwana. In the case of Indian/South-east Asian succulents there appears to have been a single, relatively recent dispersal event from Africa. We have included many species from the Arabian Peninsula and Socotra and we show that these are nested within other, mainly African clades. In some cases Arabian and Socotran taxa have their closest relatives in adjacent parts of North-east Africa and most often this is true in recent clades, while in more ancient clades their closest relatives may be in Macaronesia or in the Namib Desert of Southern Africa so that these are typical 'Rand Flora' elements. In one case, closest known relatives are in North America. We find that Socotran taxa vary between 16 and 3 Ma old. The major diversifications of succulents in temperate Southern Africa (the crown clades in subg. Rhizanthium and more minor clades in subg. Chamaesyce) and in tropical East Africa (the crown clades in subg. Euphorbia) occurred in the last 20-3 Ma. In the Greater Cape Flora of the western part of Southern Africa the diversity in Euphorbia is mainly derived from one lineage in subg. Rhizanthium and one in subg. Chamaesyce. In contrast the diversity of Euphorbia in the Arabian Peninsula is derived from the invasion (mainly from Africa) of many separate lineages. We show that large, succulent trees are only found in subg. Euphorbia and only occur in the Old World. Most of them fall within a single clade and have evolved relatively recently.
23210283|James Cuninghame (ca. 16651709) was the first person to explore, collect and send back to the West significant numbers of Chinese plants and animals. During his first voyage to the Far East, this distinguished Scottish surgeon and naturalist stopped at the island of La Palma (Canary Islands). Although we do not know the exact dates of his arrival and departure, it is clear that Cuninghame was on the island during January and February 1698. During his stay, Cuninghame collected plant specimens which are now preserved in three volumes of the Sloane Herbarium (BM-SL). A five-folio manuscript (deposited in the Sloane Manuscript collection of the British Library) listing 62 plant entries also survives, together with fragmentary lists of names prepared by James Petiver (ca. 16581718), the main recipient of Cuninghame's Canarian collection. These specimens comprise the earliest documented herbarium collection made in the Canary Islands and are one of the most important pre-Linnaean sources for the Macaronesian flora. A study of these specimens and documents shows that Cuninghame collected/recorded material of 154 taxa including one lichen, nine bryophytes, 15 ferns, two gymnosperms, and 127 flowering plants. We were able to identify all but 16 of the herbarium specimens and one of Cuninghame's manuscript names below the rank of genus, and all but three of the specimens below family level.
23210284|Material of a new fritillary was mentioned in four publications by Eduard Regel in 1884, but he used different names for this material. In the first publication it was named Fritillaria eduardii, but in the following publications the material was described as two varieties of F. imperialis L., both odourless, one with purplish flowers and one with yellow or yellow-red flowers. Both colour varieties, but especially the latter, have been taken into cultivation. Morphological observations and crossing experiments have established that both varieties do not belong to F. imperialis and should be accommodated in F. eduardii. New names for these varieties are proposed, following E. Regel's intention as closely as possible.
23210285|The valid publication and typification of Catalpa speciosa are discussed. The valid publication of C. bignonioides var. speciosa is clarified. Its first apparent neotypification is shown to be invalid, and a neotype is designated here for the name.
23210286|The name Philodendron imbe has been used for at least three species of hemi-epiphytic Philodendron species of medium stature with cordate to cordate-sagittate leaves occurring in the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. Many specimens so determined are found throughout the world's herbaria, especially in Brazil, North America, and Europe. This investigation shows that descriptions made by H.W. Schott in 1832, 1856, and 1860 differ from those of species to which the name has been most widely applied ever since; in particular, from P. acutatum Schott and P. appendiculatum Nadruz & Mayo. The name Philodendron imbe is here neotypified on plate 34, published in J. Peyritsch's Aroideae Maximilianae in 1879, based on a collection made by Franz Maly in the region of Rio de Janeiro. We propose that P. imbe is a rare and possibly extinct species from the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro State which has not been correctly identified in any collections made since 1860.
23210311|By reviewing 25 cases of western Eurasianwestern North American disjunct flowering plant taxa, we sought to improve understanding of the origin of this type of biogeographic pattern. In nine of the groups studied, phylogenetic and other evidence (often circumstantial) was found for parallel evolutionary shifts of widespread Northern Hemisphere lineages into dry environments in western Eurasia and western North America (Asteraceae-Cichorieae, Chenopodiaceae-Betoideae, Descurainia, Ericaceae-Arbutoideae, Papaver, Platanus, Antirrhineae-Maurandya group, Anemone, Styrax). Lotus s.l. also represents independent evolution of dryland taxa but is polyphyletic. Six taxa (Daucus, Erodium, Oligomeris, Plantago, Polycarpon, Senecio) and probably four others (Chenopodiaceae-Camphorosmeae, California, Antirrhineae-Gambelia group, Antirrhineae-Antirrhinum group) are likely examples of long-distance dispersal between western Eurasia and western North America. In Asteraceae-Gnaphalieae either parallel evolution or long-distance dispersal might explain the disjunction. Migration across a Beringian or North Atlantic Land Bridge appears a possible explanation for only three of the 25 disjunctions (Datisca, Cicendia, Zeltnera/Exaculum/Schenkia) based on taxon ecology and divergence times. The disjunction in Cercis remains unexplained. In short, independent ecological shifts to dry environments and long-distance dispersal probably account for the majority of taxon-disjunctions studied; migration of lineages (pre)adapted to dry conditions across either the Beringian or the North Atlantic Land Bridges, much discussed in the literature, only rarely needs to be invoked. Based on the similar times of origin of disjunctions between western Eurasian and western North American taxa and those between East Asian and eastern North American plants, we conclude that these two patterns are best regarded as parts of an ecological, geographical, and temporal continuum.
23210312|We conducted a molecular phylogenetic study of the tribe Stipeae using nine plastid DNA sequences (trnK-matK, matK, trnH-psbA, trnL-F, rps3, ndhF, rpl32-trnL, rps16-trnK, rps16 intron), the nuclear ITS DNA regions, and micromorphological characters from the lemma surface. Our large original dataset includes 156 accessions representing 139 species of Stipeae representing all genera currently placed in the tribe. The maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses of DNA sequences provide strong support for the monophyly of Stipeae; including, in phylogenetic order, Macrochloa as remote sister lineage to all other Stipeae, then a primary stepwise divergence of three deep lineages with a saw-like (SL) lemma epidermal pattern (a plesiomorphic state). The next split is between a lineage (SL1) which bifurcates into separate Eurasian and American clades, and a lineage of three parts; a small Patis (SL2) clade, as sister to Piptatherum s.str. (SL3), and the achnatheroid clade (AC). The AC exhibits a maize-like lemma epidermal pattern throughout. AC consists of a core clade of Austral-Eurasian distribution and a "major American clade" of North and South American distribution. The base chromosome number for Stipeae is somewhat ambiguous but based on our survey it seems most likely to be x = 11 or 12. Our phylogenetic hypothesis supports the recognition of the following genera and groups (listed by region): EurasiaAchnatherum, "Miliacea group", "Neotrinia" (monotypic), Orthoraphium (monotypic), Patis (also 1 from North America), Piptatherum s.str., Psammochloa (monotypic), Ptilagrostis, Stipa, "Timouria group", and Trikeraia; MediterraneanAmpelodesmos (monotypic), Celtica (monotypic), Macrochloa (monotypic), and "Stipella-Inaequiglumes group"; AustralasiaAnemanthele (monotypic), and Austrostipa: North America (NA)"Eriocoma group", Hesperostipa, Oryzopsis (monotypic), Piptatheropsis, "Pseudoeriocoma group", and "Stillmania" (monotypic); South AmericaAciachne, Amelichloa (also NA), Anatherostipa (s.str.), Jarava (polyphyletic), Lorenzochloa, Nassella (also NA), Ortachne, Pappostipa (also NA), and Piptochaetium (also NA). Monophyly of Phaenospermateae including Duthieinae is demonstrated, and its inclusion within or treatment as sister to Stipeae is rejected.
23210313|The phylogenetic position of two enigmatic Asian orchid genera, Thaia and Tangtsinia, were inferred from molecular data and morphological evidence. An analysis of combined plastid data (rbcL+matK+psaB) using Bayesian and parsimony methods revealed that Thaia is a sister group to the higher epidendroids, and tribe Neottieae is polyphyletic unless Thaia is removed. Morphological evidence, such as plicate leaves and corms, the structure of the gynostemium and the micromorphology of pollinia, also indicates that Thaia should be excluded from Neottieae. Thaieae, a new tribe, is therefore tentatively established. Using Bayesian and parsimony methods, analyses of combined plastid and nuclear datasets (rbcL, matK, psaB, trnL-F, ITS, Xdh) confirmed that the monotypic genus Tangtsinia was nested within and is synonymous with the genus Cephalanthera, in which an apical stigma has evolved independently at least twice. The tribe Neottieae (excluding Thaia) is strongly supported as monophyletic based on molecular analyses and divided into three clades as follows: Palmorchis diverged earliest; Cephalanthera (including the former Tangtsinia) is sister to the remaining of the genera; and Aphyllorchis is immediate sister to Limodorum, forming a third clade with Neottia Guett. (including Listera) and Epipactis.
23210314|The phylogenetic position and circumscription of the disjunct African genus Tribulocarpus is investigated with DNA sequences from plastid rps16 and trnL-F, and nuclear ITS. Representatives from all four subfamilies of Aizoaceae are included in the analyses, most of them from Aizooideae and Sesuvioideae. The position of Tribulocarpus as sister to the rest of Sesuvioideae is confirmed, and we agree that the genus should be referred to this subfamily. Tetragonia retusa is found to be part of the Tribulocarpus clade with strong support. A new taxonomy of Tribulocarpus with two species is proposed and the new combination Tribulocarpus retusus is made. A lectotype is designated for Tetragonia somalensis. Tribulocarpus dimorphanthus, disjunctly distributed in south-western and north-eastern Africa, is retrieved as paraphyletic with regard to T. retusus, endemic in Somalia, as the latter is sister to the north-east African part of T. dimorphanthus only. Despite the genetic difference between the samples from the disjunct populations of T. dimorphanthus no morphological differences could be detected. Tribulocarpus dimorphanthusT. retusus is suggested as an example of a progenitor-derivative species pair, where T. retusus has budded off from the north-eastern partial area of distribution of T. dimorphanthus. The compound and spiny fruits of T. dimorphanthus versus the simple and broadly winged fruits of T. retusus indicate a rapid adaptive shift from zoochorous trample burrs to anemochorous nuts.
23210315|The phylogenetic position of the Afro-Asian genus Sphaerocoma is investigated using DNA sequences from plastid rps16 and ndhF, as well as from nuclear ITS and RPB2. Seven accessions of Sphaerocoma, representing all three currently recognized taxa, are analyzed along with sequences from genera that have been found to be closely related to Sphaerocoma in broader studies of Caryophyllaceae. The Afro-Arabian Pollichia is indicated as sister to Sphaerocoma, and this Sphaerocoma-Pollichia clade is sister to a clade with Macaronesian Polycarpaea and the widely distributed Polycarpon prostratum. A close relationship between the anemochorous Sphaerocoma and the endozoochorous Pollichia has never previously been suggested, but some similarities in, e.g., floral characters are pointed out. Sphaerocoma is strongly supported as monophyletic, but no significant molecular variation within the genus could be detected. A new taxonomy of Sphaerocoma is proposed, where a single species with two geographically and morphologically defined subspecies are recognized: S. hookeri subsp. hookeri in coastal areas along the Red Sea in Egypt, Sudan and Saudi-Arabia, near Aden in Yemen, and in Somalia, and S. hookeri subsp. aucheri comb. & stat. nov. in coastal areas in south-eastern Yemen, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Iran, and Pakistan. A lectotype is designated for S. hookeri.
23210316|Tribe Cochlearieae is among few isolated evolutionary lineages in the mustard family and comprises only about 30 species. Earlier taxonomic concepts recognised five genera that might belong with Cochlearia in this tribe (Bivonaea, Ionopsidium, Minaea, Pastorea, Thlaspi), though Pastorea and Minaea have already been reduced to synonymy of Ionopsidium. Focusing on DNA sequence information from the nuclear-encoded internal transcribed spacer regions ITS1 and ITS2 and the plastid trnL-F region, the phylogenetic position of all Ionopsidium species is evaluated within a detailed phylogenetic framework of tribe Cochlearieae. It is shown that the tribe can be divided into two major groups: (i) a central European Cochlearia clade extending its distribution far into northern and arctic regions, and (ii) a western Mediterranean clade comprising all six Ionopsidium species and three Cochlearia species from the Iberian Peninsula nested within Ionopsidium. Consequently, neither Cochlearia nor Ionopsidium represent monophyletic genera. The deep split between the two clades dates back to the middle Miocene, approximately 13.8 million years ago. The divergence times between the different major groups within the Ionopsidium clades predate or are associated with the Messinian salinity crisis in the late Miocene which also agrees with the relictual and phylogenetically isolated status of the tribe. Only taxa of Cochlearia sect. Cochlearia (Cochlearia clade) underwent a rapid and very recent radiation in the mid or late Pleistocene. Four new taxonomic combinations (Ionopsidium aragonensis (H.J. Coste & Souli) M. Koch, I. aragonensis subsp. navarranum (P. Monts.) M. Koch, I. glastifolium (L.) M. Koch, and I. megalospermum (Maire) M. Koch) and the new tribe Bivonaeeae are proposed to reflect the deep evolutionary split within the group, which is further supported by DNA sequence variation of the nuclear-encoded, single-copy gene chalcone synthase (chs).
23210317|The phylogenetic relationships between Lonchocarpus s.l. and allies were studied using Bayesian and parsimony independent and combined analyses of nuclear ribosomal DNA (5.8S and flanking internal transcribed spacers ITS1 and 2) and chloroplast DNA (trnL-trnF, matK) sequences. Topologies resulting from ITS and combined datasets were congruent, while the matK analysis resulted in poorly resolved hypotheses probably because of its low substitution rate. Our results support the monophyly of Apurimacia, Deguelia, Philenoptera, Piscidia, and Tephrosia and the polyphyly of Millettia. Lonchocarpus, as traditionally circumscribed, is paraphyletic, and subgenera and sections within it are also paraphyletic or polyphyletic with the exception of sect. Willardia which is monophyletic. In Lonchocarpus s.l., three large subclades can be recognized, here referred to as the Muellera, the Dahlstedtia, and the Lonchocarpus s.str. subclades. We propose recogition of these as three recircumscribed genera (Muellera, Dahlstedtia, Lonchocarpus) supported by morphological traits and major distribution ranges. The genera Bergeronia and Margaritolobium are synonymized with Muellera. Nineteen new combinations in Muellera and ten in Dahlstedtia are proposed, and five lectotypes are presented. Analysis of the molecular data reveals that (1) Lonchocarpus s.str. originated about 8.70.05 Ma ago in Central America, in contrast to Dahlstedtia and Muellera that both arose in South America, 6.30.05 Ma and 8.00.09 Ma ago, respectively; (2) at least three migration events of Lonchocarpus have occurred from Central to South America, and one to Africa, the latter best explained by long distance dispersal across the Atlantic Ocean.
23210318|Sapindaceae (Sapindales) are a conspicuous and diversified element of the New Caledonian flora, with ca. 67 species (ca. 90% endemic) in 13 genera (four endemic: Gongrodiscus, Loxodiscus, Podonephelium, Storthocalyx). The phylogeny of New Caledonian Sapindaceae is inferred by adding 97 new samples, encompassing the full distributional and morphological range of the archipelago's genera, to a broad plastid and nuclear DNA sequence dataset that is representative of the family worldwide. Results from phylogenetic analyses indicate that members of the family on New Caledonia belong to two major clades, the Dodonaea group (placed within subfamily Dodonaeoideae) and the Cupania group (subfamily Sapindoideae), which exhibit strikingly different species diversities (ca. 89% of the species on New Caledonia belong to the Cupania group). Results support the monophyly of all four endemic genera and most of those that also occur elsewhere, with the exception of the morphologically similar Austro-Pacific genera Arytera and Cupaniopsis, both of which have representatives in each of two well-supported subclades within the Cupania group, suggesting at least two dispersals to New Caledonia (most likely from Australia). The results provide a robust phylogenetic framework for ongoing taxonomic revisions of Sapindaceae genera on New Caledonia and for investigating the spatio-temporal history of the family in this biogeographically intriguing archipelago, although expanded sampling (including from other areas) and further analyses will be required to resolve generic limits among the taxa currently placed in Arytera and Cupaniopsis.
23210319|The genus Calibrachoa (Solanaceae) comprises approximately 27 species that are found in open areas of southern South America, with the exception of C. parviflora, which also occurs in North America and Europe, probably as a result of introduction from South America and subsequent naturalization. The genus is closely related to Petunia, but differs in characteristics such as chromosome number, corolla aestivation, seed morphology, and leaf anatomy. Previous publications have shown that C. parviflora and C. pygmaea have morphological, ecological, and molecular features that differ from those of the other species of Calibrachoa, which had also been shown in a phylogenetic study using cpDNA RFLPs. In this paper, we present phylogenies based on chloroplast sequence data from psbB-psbH, trnS-trnG, and trnL-trnF intergenic spacers and the trnL intron, which corroborate the segregation of Calibrachoa species in two highly supported clades. On the basis of these results and the morphological and ecological evidence, we propose that each Calibrachoa clade be recognized at the subgeneric level. A new subgenus, Calibrachoa subg. Stimomphis, is recognized, which includes 25 species, whereas C. parviflora and C. pygmaea are in C. subg. Calibrachoa. A list of species that belong to each subgenus is provided, and lectotypes, neotypes, or epitypes are designated for eight names in Calibrachoa.
23210320|Both the tribe Tabernaemontaneae and the genus Tabernaemontana have been much discussed concerning delimitation and classification. In the present paper, the pollen morphology of Tabernaemontaneae s.l. is studied with light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and compared with the results of a phylogenetic analysis of molecular data. No pollen morphological synapomorphy was found supporting the monophyly of the tribe Tabernaemontaneae s.l. The monophyly of Tabernaemontaneae s.str. is supported by the occurrence of distinctly lalongate endoapertures that might be fused to form an endocingulum. Although the endocingulum does occur in some Old World species, it is interpreted as a synapomorphy of the New World species, which make up a monophyletic group according to molecular data. The inclusion of the genus Stemmadenia in the New World clade within Tabernaemontana is fully supported by pollen morphology. The Old World Tabernaemontana clade is supported by the occurrence of densely perforate pollen with long colpi.
23210321|The high-arctic environment supports very few annual plants, but more annuals can be expected to move northwards following climate warming. Here we address the history of the amphi-Atlantic, hemiparasitic Euphrasia minima complex, which is taxonomically intricate and consists of annuals typically growing in alpine, north boreal, and low-arctic habitats. Recently it has also been discovered at three distantly separated sites in the high-arctic archipelago of Svalbard. We analyzed Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) and chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) variation in populations from most of the range of the complex. The main split observed in both datasets, dated to nearly 6 Ma ago, was between one central/southern European alpine lineage (E. minima s.str.) and one northern amphi-Atlantic lineage (E. wettsteinii). The E. wettsteinii lineage consisted of two cpDNA sublineages, both amphi-Atlantic and partly sympatric, estimated to have diverged 1.7 Ma ago. Two main northern subgroups were also revealed in the AFLP dataset, partly consistent with the cpDNA sublineages: one E Atlantic subgroup (N Russia, extending into Scotland and Colesdalen in Svalbard), and one mainly W Atlantic subgroup (NE Canada, Greenland, and Iceland, extending into N Norway). A third subgroup was restricted to two of the three Svalbard populations, Bockfjorden and Ossian Sarsfjellet. Assignment tests of the Svalbard populations suggest that Colesdalen was derived from N Russian source populations and Bockfjorden from N Norwegian ones; the assignment of the Ossian Sarsfjellet population was uncertain. However, as all Svalbard populations were distinctly divergent from each other as well as from all other populations in AFLP marker frequencies, it is unlikely that their establishment in Svalbard is caused by the current climate warming or recent human activities. Their divergence is probably due to founder effects and genetic drift following independent earlier immigrations, possibly during the postglacial warm period 9500 to 4000 years ago.
23210322|The tribe Phlomideae (Lamiaceae: Lamioideae) is divided into the three genera Phlomis, Phlomoides (incl. Pseuderemostachys, Lamiophlomis and Notochaete), and Eremostachys (incl. Paraeremostachys), contains about 278 species and has a distribution range extending from Europe to Mongolia, China, and India. Here, we present a phylogenetic analysis based on nuclear ribosomal (ITS) and cpDNA (partial trnK, rpl32-trnL, and trnT-A) sequence data of 56 accessions representing all genera and major subgeneric taxa of Phlomideae. Taxon sampling covered the genera Phlomoides and Eremostachys more intensively than previous phylogenetic investigations of the tribe. Parsimony and Bayesian analyses of each marker, as well as the combined plastid datasets, produced nearly congruent trees. Monophyly of Phlomis s.str. is confirmed here, although only few representatives of this genus were included. In all obtained trees a core group of Phlomoides and Eremostachys is strongly supported. In accordance with morphological evidence, molecular data confirm the inclusion of Eremostachys, Notochaete, and Paraeremostachys in Phlomoides. In conclusion, the number of recognized genera in Phlomideae is reduced to two: Phlomis and Phlomoides. The necessary new combinations are proposed.
23210323|The Chiliotrichum group (Compositae: Astereae) is an informal taxonomic group consisting of shrubby daisies that grow mainly in the Andean and Patagonian regions of South America; it is composed of 31 species in 11 genera: Aylacophora, Cabreraea, Chiliotrichiopsis, Chiliophyllum, Chiliotrichum, Haroldia, Katinasia, Lepidophyllum, Llerasia, Nardophyllum, and Ocyroe. We analyzed phylogenetic relationships in the Chiliotrichum group using five DNA regions from two plant genomes: the plastid trnL-trnF and rpl32-trnL(UAG) spacers, the rpl16 intron, and the nuclear ribosomal internal and external transcribed spacers, ITS and ETS respectively. The dataset includes 21 ingroup species representing all the genera, and 10 outgroup species belonging to six genera. Maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference analyses performed on the chloroplast and nuclear data support the monophyly of the group. The four major clades recovered on the basis of the combined nuclear evidence (ITS+ETS) are: (1) Llerasia clade, (2) Nardophyllum clade, (3) Chiliotrichum clade, and (4) a clade formed by Nardophyllum+Llerasia clades. As regards the status of the four non-monospecific genera, Chiliotrichum (2 spp.) and Llerasia (14 spp.) were recovered as monophyletic, whereas the other two, Nardophyllum (5 spp.) and Chiliotrichiopsis (3 spp.), were not recovered as monophyletic. These two are nonetheless recognized as distinct genera because of robust morphological support despite the lack of resolution in the phylogeny based solely on sequence data. The rest of the genera composing the group are monospecific, and they are scattered among the major clades in the group. The only genus with no clear position is Haroldia. An analysis of the morphological data shows that the presence of paleae, believed to function as a defensive structure for the protection of the achenes, is well correlated with other derived head and floret traits such as the number of florets per head and the type of pappus.
23210324|Polyploidy is an important evolutionary mechanism in plants, and in some genera (e.g., Solidago in Asteraceae) it is particularly widespread and is hypothesized to have played a major role in diversification. Goldenrods are notorious for their ploidy variation, with roughly 14% and 32% of recognized North American species being polyploid or including multiple cytotypes, respectively. We used traditional chromosome counts and flow cytometry to examine cytogeographic patterns, biogeographic and evolutionary hypotheses, and species boundaries in S. subsect. Humiles. Chromosome numbers and DNA ploidy determinations are reported for 337 individuals, including 148 new reports. Cytotypes show significant geographic structuring. Solidago simplex and S. spathulata were uniformly diploid (2n = 18) in western North America, while cytogeographic patterns in eastern North America were regionally complex and included 2n, 4n, and 6n cytotypes. Cytotypes within S. simplex were ecogeographically segregated and mixed-ploidy populations were rare. Data from this study and additional biosystematic data indicate that cytotypes in S. simplex fulfill the requirements of multiple species concepts and should best be treated as distinct species. Polyploid cytotypes possibly formed recurrently, however, and evolution and species boundaries within polyploid S. simplex will require additional study. Results from this study and accumulated data from other studies suggest that biological species diversity in Solidago is considerably higher than currently recognized taxonomically.
23210325|Grindelia is among the most taxonomically challenging groups of North American composites. The genus as a whole has an amphitropical distribution, with approximately half of the species native to North America and Mexico and the remainder native to South America. We used DNA sequence data from the nuclear ribosomal ITS and ETS and chloroplast psaI-accD regions to revisit hypotheses on biogeographic history across the genus. Grindelia as a whole is well-supported and is composed of two sister clades, one native to South America and the other native to North America including Mexico. The North American taxa constitute two clades that largely occur on different sides of the Continental Divide. The diverse radiation of Grindelia in the California Floristic Province appears to be most closely related to species from the Great Basin and Colorado Plateau and evidently descended from drought-adapted ancestors. Although Steyermark's hypotheses about the relationships of North American Grindelia are not all supported, we did recover a clade corresponding to his Pacific radiation and many of the Mexican and Texan species that he hypothesized to be basal in the genus represent early diverging lineages in our trees. Dunford's cytogenetic data on the North American species of Grindelia were also examined in a phylogenetic context.
23210326|Herbarium specimens are a vital resource in botanical taxonomy. Many herbaria are undertaking large-scale digitization projects to improve access and to preserve delicate specimens, and in doing so are creating large sets of images. Leaf characters are important for describing taxa and distinguishing between them and they can be measured from herbarium specimens. Here, we demonstrate that herbarium images can be analysed using suitable software and that leaf characters can be extracted automatically. We describe a low-cost digitization process that we use to create a set of 1895 images of Tilia L. specimens, and novel botanical image processing software. The output of the software is a set of leaf characters. As a demonstration of this approach, we extract the length and width of a large number of leaves automatically from images of whole herbarium specimens. We show that the lengths and widths that we extract are very strongly correlated with values in a published account of cultivated species, but are also consistently smaller. We discuss some particular features of herbarium specimens that may affect the results of this form of analysis, and consider further applications to extract characters such as leaf shape and margin characters.
23210329|Discovery of three sheets of original material of the name Eleutheranthera ovata Poit. in the herbarium of the Museum national d'Histoire naturelle in Paris permits the lectotypification of this (now rejected) name.
23210521|Pollen characters in Araceae accord well with recent DNA-based phylogenies, and here we provide a new example of "compass needle" quality in Araceae on the basis of two closely related genera, Schismatoglottis and Apoballis. All investigated Schismatoglottis pollen is psilate (smooth pollen surface) with calcium crystals covering the pollen surface. By contrast, pollen of species transferred to recently resurrected Apoballis (Apoballis acuminatissima and A. mutata) is distinctively echinate (spiny). A unique layer covers the endexine of Schismatoglottis, and the whole pollen surface of Apoballis. Our findings strongly suggest that "Schismatoglottis" species with echinate pollen fall into the genus Apoballis. Moreover, all schismatoglottid taxa perform spathe movements during anthesis to control the movement of pollinators. The spathe movements of Apoballis acuminatissima clearly differ from those known in Schismatoglottis species, and indeed are so far unique for the entire family. This, together with differences in floral odour is strongly suggestive of differences in pollination ecology between the genera Schismatoglottis and Apoballis.
23210522|Dorotheantheae (Aizoaceae) is a small tribe of succulent annual herbs with flat leaves belonging to the genera Aethephyllum, Cleretum and Dorotheanthus, which are endemic to the winter-rainfall region of South Africa. Several species are well-known for their conspicuous and striking flowers but others possess very inconspicuous flowers. Analysis of molecular data from combined plastid and nuclear sequences shows that Dorotheanthus is monophyletic while Cleretum is diphyletic, since the two species of Cleretum with lyrate leaves are most closely related to the vegetatively similar, monotypic Aethephyllum. In the absence of clear, diagnostic characteristics for separating Cleretum and Dorotheanthus, a revised classification for the Dorotheantheae is proposed in which the tribe consists of a single genus, Cleretum. Within Cleretum, we recognize 14 species, by raising/re-instating two subspecies to species rank and including two that are still undescribed. The major clades occupy distinct climatic and edaphic niches. Repeated shifting from large to small flowers may indicate changes in the breeding system. Since succulence in annuals is rare in the winter-rainfall region of southern Africa, we compare patterns of distribution between Dorotheantheae and the other leaf-succulent annuals in the region, namely in Mesembryanthemum (Aizoaceae) and in Crassula (Crassulaceae). We find that similar to the non-succulent annuals of the Poaceae and the Brassicaceae in this region, the annual species of Mesembryanthemum show a preference for arid areas. In contrast, in Dorotheantheae and in Crassula the hot-spots of diversity lie mainly in the wetter parts of the winter-rainfall area, with a decrease in the number of annual species northwards to the arid, winter-rainfall areas of the Richtersveld and the southern Namib.
23210523|Turneraceae, with just over 200 species in 10 genera, is today often included in a widely circumscribed Passifloraceae. The vast majority of the species are found in the New World, whereas generic diversity is largest in the Old World. According to current circumscriptions, three of the genera show trans-Atlantic disjunctions: Turnera with over 135 species in America and two species in Africa (one in the south-western and one in the north-eastern part), Piriqueta with 44 species in America and one in southern Africa, and Erblichia with one species in Central America and four in Madagascar. The phylogeny of Turneraceae is reconstructed based on DNA sequences from plastid trnL-F and nuclear ITS and sampling for all genera, including both New and Old World species for the trans-Atlantic groups to test their monophyly. The genera of Turneraceae form a strongly supported monophyletic group, the Turneraceae clade, within Passifloraceae s.l. The phylogeny is geographically structured, with one clade comprising American species only, except for the two African species of Turnera, and another clade with all other African species plus the Central American Erblichia odorata. Turnera is retrieved as monophyletic with the two African species appearing as close relatives of T. ulmifolia, the type of Turnera. The existence of a trans-Atlantic disjunction in Turnera is therefore supported. It is most likely caused by long-distance dispersal and estimated to be not older than late Miocene. In Piriqueta only the American species are supported as a monophyletic group, whereas the single African species is resolved as a member of the African clade. The trans-Atlantic disjunction in Piriqueta is therefore not supported and the African species is proposed to be placed in a genus of its own, Afroqueta gen. nov., as Afroqueta capensis comb. nov. Erblichia on Madagascar is supported as sister to Mathurina, a genus endemic to Rodrigues Island in the Mascarenes, and does not group with E. odorata in Central America, the type of Erblichia. The trans-Atlantic disjunction in Erblichia is therefore not supported either and the genus Arboa gen. nov. is proposed to accommodate the four Malagasy species, Arboa integrifolia comb. nov., Arboa berneriana comb. nov., Arboa madagascariensis comb. nov., and Arboa antsingyae comb. nov.
23210524|The genus Alcea (Malvaceae) includes approximately 50 species of mainly Irano-Turanian distribution and is considered one of the most challenging genera of the Middle East, due to its uniformity and pronounced plasticity in morphological traits. Here, using three molecular markers (nrDNA ITS and the plastid spacers psbA-trnH and trnL-trnF), we present a phylogeny of Alcea and test previous infrageneric taxonomic hypotheses as well as its monophyly with respect to Althaea, a genus with which it has often been merged. We additionally discuss morphological variation and the utility of morphological characters as predictors of phylogenetic relationships. Our results show that while molecular data unambiguously support the circumscription of Alcea inferred from morphology, they prove to be of limited utility in resolving interspecific relationships, suggesting that Alcea's high species diversity is due to rapid and recent radiation. Our work provides the first phylogeny of Alcea and aims to set the scene for the study of processes underlying species radiation in the Irano-Turanian region, a main centre of species diversity for many medium-sized to large genera that remains greatly understudied.
23210525|Bursera is one of the most diverse and abundant groups of trees and shrubs of the Mexican tropical dry forests. Its interaction with its specialist herbivores in the chrysomelid genus Blepharida, is one of the best-studied coevolutionary systems. Prior studies based on molecular phylogenies concluded that Bursera is a monophyletic genus. Recently, however, other molecular analyses have suggested that the genus might be paraphyletic, with the closely related Commiphora, nested within Bursera. If this is correct, then interpretations of coevolution results would have to be revised. Whether Bursera is or is not monophyletic also has implications for the age of Burseraceae, since previous dates were based on calibrations using Bursera fossils assuming that Bursera was paraphyletic. We performed a phylogenetic analysis of 76 species and varieties of Bursera, 51 species of Commiphora, and 13 outgroups using nuclear DNA data. We also reconstructed a phylogeny of the Burseraceae using 59 members of the family, 9 outgroups and nuclear and chloroplast sequence data. These analyses strongly confirm previous conclusions that this genus is monophyletic. New calculations of the age of Burseraceae date the beginning of its diversification to at least 93 million years ago.
23210526|The taxonomy of Nyssa (Nyssaceae) in China is confused and uncertain due to differing views about how many species should be recognized, and a scarcity of good morphological differential characters. In the present study, we examined 52 morphological characters from up to fifty accessions each of six of the seven species recognized in the Flora of China: N. yunnanensis, N. javanica, N. sinensis, N. shangszeensis, N. shweliensis and N. wenshanensis. Based on both principal coordinate analysis and UPGMA cluster analysis, N. yunnanensis and N. javanica were both morphologically distinct. However, accessions of N. sinensis, N. shangszeensis, N. shweliensis and N. wenshanensis were intermixed in both analyses and could not be discriminated from each other. Sequence data from nuclear ITS and the chloroplast regions trnH-psbA, rps16r-f, trnL-rps32F, trnS-G and trnL-F were used to further analyze the Nyssa species listed above, together with N. aquatica and N. sylvatica from North America. All analyses of the DNA data using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods strongly supported the monophyly of Nyssa. Within Nyssa, N. yunnanensis and N. javanica were resolved as sister species, which were genetically distinct. The other four Chinese taxa were barely differentiated by molecular data, with only N. shangszeensis and N. wenshanensis weakly supported as monophyletic. Hence, based on morphological and molecular data, we recommend that N. shangszeensis, N. shweliensis and N. wenshanensis be reduced to synonyms of N. sinensis, and only N. sinensis, N. yunnanensis and N. javanica be recognized for Flora of China. The American N. aquatica and N. sylvatica were sister species in the cpDNA but not in the ITS analyses, indicating possible reticulate evolution.
23210527|The present study contributes to a better understanding of major palynological trends in Impatiens, one of the largest genera in angiosperms, and evaluates the phylogenetic usefulness of pollen morphological characters in the genus. The pollen morphological diversity of 115 Asian species of the genus was investigated using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy and analyzed in a phylogenetic framework using Bayesian inference and Bayesian posterior character mapping as well as parsimony character optimization. Despite the rather young age of Impatiens and its extremely rapid radiation, a striking palynological variability could be observed. The ancestral pollen type in Impatiens is a triangular, tri-aperturate pollen grain with reticulate sexine ornamentation, which subsequently evolved into the main Impatiens pollen type: a 4-aperturate, rectangular pollen grain with a reticulate sexine ornamentation. The most recently diversified Asian clades are characterized by several reversions from 4-aperturate to 3-aperturate and changes in sexine ornamentation from reticulate to microreticulate sexine ornamentation. Also differences in pollen view can be observed amongst the most recently diversified Asian lineages ranging from circular, quadrangular, elliptic to sub-elliptic and rectangular. Although some pollen morphological characters seem to be homoplasious, others help to improve the resolution of some phylogenetically problematic lineages in the genus.
23210528|The circumscription of genera belonging to tribe Bignonieae (Bignoniaceae) has traditionally been complex, with only a few genera having stable circumscriptions in the various classification systems proposed for the tribe. The genus Lundia, for instance, is well characterized by a series of morphological synapomorphies and its circumscription has remained quite stable throughout its history. Despite the stable circumscription of Lundia, the circumscription of species within the genus has remained problematic. This study aims to reconstruct the phylogeny of Lundia in order to refine species circumscriptions, gain a better understanding of relationships between taxa, and identify potential morphological synapomorphies for species and major clades. We sampled 26 accessions representing 13 species of Lundia, and 5 outgroups, and reconstructed the phylogeny of the genus using a chloroplast (ndhF) and a nuclear marker (PepC). Data derived from sequences of the individual loci were analyzed using parsimony and Bayesian inference, and the combined molecular dataset was analyzed with Bayesian methods. The monophyly of Lundia nitidula, a species with a particularly complex circumscription, was tested using Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) test and the approximately unbiased test for phylogenetic tree selection (AU test). In addition, 40 morphological characters were mapped onto the tree that resulted from the analysis of the combined molecular dataset in order to identify morphological synapomorphies of individual species and major clades. Lundia and most species currently recognized within the genus were strongly supported as monophyletic in all analyses. One species, Lundia nitidula, was not resolved as monophyletic, but the monophyly of this species was not rejected by the AU and SH tests. Lundia sect. Eriolundia is resolved as paraphyletic in all analyses, while Lundia sect. Eulundia is monophyletic and supported by the same morphological characters traditionally used to circumscribe this section. The phylogeny of Lundia contributed important information for a better circumscription of species and served as basis the taxonomic revision of the genus.
23210529|The genus Jovellana is the sister group to the larger genus Calceolaria, together composing the family Calceolariaceae. Four species are currently recognised, two in New Zealand (J. sinclairii, J. repens) and two in Chile (J. punctata, J. violacea). The distribution is disjunct across the Pacific Ocean and has long been believed to be a remnant of an ancient vicariance following the break-up of Gondwana. In this study we infer a species-tree phylogeny of the genus using three chloroplast and four nuclear DNA sequences. By exploring three modes of estimating stem and crown ages of the family Calceolariaceae, a Jovellana species tree could be inferred and dated using a secondary calibration. With this approach we can demonstrate that genetic data, despite slightly different signals from unlinked and linked molecular markers, support the idea that the presence of Jovellana in New Zealand is the result of recent long-distance dispersal across the Pacific Ocean from South America.
23210530|The phylogenetic position of the monotypic genus Wenchengia has long been controversial. It variously has been assigned to a monotypic subfamily Wenchengioideae, treated as a member of subfamily Scutellarioideae, or suggested to be related to Lamioideae or Ajugoideae. The recent rediscovery of Wenchengia alternifolia from its type locality provided an opportunity to infer its phylogenetic position using evidence from two plastid DNA regions (rbcL, ndhF), morphological data, and anatomical and cytological characters. Both the molecular data and a combination of the molecular and the morphological data suggested a close relationship of the genus to a clade consisting of Holmskioldia, Tinnea, and Scutellaria representing Scutellarioideae. This relationship is also supported by a striking similarity in gross morphological, anatomical, and cytological characters between Wenchengia and other genera of Scutellarioideae, suggesting that it should be more appropriate to treat the genus as a member of Scutellarioideae, rather than assigning it to a monotypic subfamily.
23210531|A phylogenetic study of Oxypolis and Ptilimnium, two small genera of tribe Oenantheae (Apiaceae: subfamily Apioideae), was carried out. Generic circumscriptions and infrageneric and infraspecific relationships were investigated through parsimony and Bayesian inference analyses of nuclear rDNA ITS and cpDNA trnQ-5rps16 and 3rps16-5trnK intergenic spacer sequences. Fruit anatomical characters were also examined and used in conjunction with leaf morphology to corroborate the results of the phylogenetic analyses. Each genus as currently delimited has both compound-leaved and rachis-leaved species. Results of the phylogenetic analyses show that neither Oxypolis nor Ptilimnium is monophyletic; each genus is split into two strongly supported clades that correspond to differences in leaf morphology within the groups. Fruit anatomical characters support these splits. The fruits of compound-leaved and rachis-leaved Oxypolis species differ in the number of commissural vittae per mericarp, the branching of the vittae, and the lignification of mericarp around the seed. The fruits of compound-leaved and rachis-leaved Ptilimnium species differ in the compression of the mericarps and the development of the marginal ribs. The fruits of rachis-leaved Oxypolis and rachis-leaved Ptilimnium species also differ in the compression of the mericarps and the development of the marginal ribs. Based on analyses of molecular data and corroboration with morphological and fruit anatomical data, new circumscriptions for the genera Oxypolis and Ptilimnium are formalized. Each of the two polyphyletic genera (Oxypolis and Ptilimnium) is split, two genera (Tiedemannia and Harperella) are resurrected, and three new combinations are made.
23210532|The Goodeniaceae, close relatives of the Asteraceae, are a conspicuous part of the flora of Australia and many islands in the Pacific. A comprehensive molecular phylogenetic analysis of the family using cpDNA regions trnL-F and matK is presented, including representatives of all genera and nearly half the species. The family resolves into the two large clades: 'LAD' (Lechenaultia, Anthotium, Dampiera) and 'Core Goodeniaceae' (Brunonia, Scaevola, Diaspasis, Coopernookia, Goodenia, Selliera, Velleia, Verreauxia, Pentaptilon), which are also supported by morphological characters. The former Brunoniaceae, comprising the single species Brunonia australis, is clearly placed within the Goodeniaceae as sister to the remainder of Core Goodeniaceae while possessing many autapomorphic characteristics. Current subgeneric taxonomic groups are partially supported as monophyletic within Goodenia and Dampiera, but are generally non-monophyletic within Lechenaultia and Scaevola. Fruit types and floral traits involved in pollination and adaptations to aridity have evolved in a highly convergent fashion within several major clades. Rates of molecular evolution and number of extant taxa differ at several points between sister clades, particularly between Brunonia and the rest of Core Goodeniaceae, and between Scaevola s.l. and Goodenia s.l. Future taxonomic changes will involve the synonymization of Selliera and monotypic Diaspasis and, pending more comprehensive taxon and molecular sampling, the large, paraphyletic genus Goodenia may be split into at least three genera.
23210533|The tribe Liabeae (Compositae) contains ca. 175 species distributed in 18 genera and its members occupy a variety of habitats in the Andes of South America as well as in Mexico, Central America, and the West Indies. The tribe is recognizable by a combination of morphological characters. DNA sequence data from the nuclear ribosomal ITS region and three chloroplast regions (trnL-F, 3 end of ndhF, matK; a total of more than 5 kb of sequence data) were used to infer a phylogeny. The data were analyzed using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference. The results support the monophyly of the tribe and show a consistent placement for all genera except Cacosmia. Four well-supported clades are recovered in the remainder of the tribe, all recognized as subtribes. Liabineae (Ferreyranthus, Dillandia, Oligactis, Sampera, Liabum) are the sister group of the rest of the tribe. Sinclairineae (Sinclairiopsis and Sinclairia with segregates Liabellum and Megaliabum) are the sister group of Munnoziinae (Chrysactinium nested inside Munnozia s.l.) plus Paranepheliinae (Stephenbeckia, Microliabum, Pseudonoseris, Paranephelius, Chionopappus, Philoglossa, Erato). Cacosmia is placed as the sister group of either all the rest of the tribe or of subtribe Liabineae; morphologically its characters are either autapomorphic or plesiomorphic. Bishopanthus could not be confidently placed in any of the subtribes; it is only known from scraps of the type and a molecular study is not possible. The phylogeny slightly alters previous assumptions about the biogeography and it seems that Liabeae originated in the central and northern Andes and spread north and south with several independent introductions into Mexico and Central America and one into the Caribbean. With the exception of the Liabeae (Andes) and Moquineae (Brazil), all of the tribes in the subfamily Cichorioideae are either restricted to or have their basal grade in Africa.
23210534|The etymology of names is regarded as an important component of taxonomic literature, but the derivation of names described in older works is often misinterpreted. The reasons for this are several-fold, including failing to consult the original publication, misinterpreting the describing author's intentions, or attempting to retrofit a name to accommodate the current circumscription of the taxon. An example of the latter is the name Ceramium Roth, derived from the Greek ceramion, meaning pitcher or vessel, but currently applied to a genus of red algae with no vessel-like structures. It is shown that the name was most likely derived from an earlier publication, wherein it was coined in reference to the reproductive structures in a red alga currently known as Gracilaria and unrelated to present-day Ceramium.
41679268|The Hypnodendrales are an order of generally very robust pleurocarpous mosses in which most taxa have one of three distinct growth forms. The group includes four monotypic genera, two of which, Cyrtopodendron and Franciella, are endemic to New Caledonia. We investigate the phylogenetic relationships of these two taxa and of Pterobryella rgida, also a New Caledonian endemic, and demonstrate that Cyrtopodendron and Franciella should be recognised within Pterobryella and Spiridens respectively as P. vieillardii and S. spiridentoides. We further use Bayesian methods to reconstruct ancestral character states for macro-morphological type and substrate preference within the order, to evaluate hypotheses of correlated evolution of these morphological and ecological characters, and to test for directionality in their evolution. The results suggest that macro-morphology evolves in conjunction with shifts between epiphytic and non-epiphytic substrates, with the dendroid architecture strongly associated with non-epiphytic substrates and the morphologies we term "stipitate-frondose" and "spiridentoid" associated with epiphytism. Ancestral character state reconstruction challenges previous hypotheses that the strictly dendroid form is plesiomorphic within the Hypnodendrales and suggests that the stipitate-frondose architecture may have arisen very early within the evolution of the group, although states for the earliest nodes remain ambiguous. The spiridentoid growth form characteristic of Spiridens, Cyrtopus and Bescherellia may be inherited from a shared common ancestor, with the dendroid morphology of Hypnodendron s.str. being derived, while within Pterobryella the balance of evidence favours an epiphytic, stipitate-frondose common ancestor from which the lithophytic species found on New Caledonia and Lord Howe are descended. Transitions between the major growth forms found within the order are highly homoplastic, facilitating adaptive shifts between epiphytic and non-epiphytic substrates and explaining the paraphyly of some previously recognised genera and families.
41679269|We present a family-level classification for the eupolypod II clade of leptosporangiate ferns, one of the two major lineages within the Eupolypods, and one of the few parts of the fern tree of life where family-level relationships were not well understood at the time of publication of the 2006 fern classification by Smith & al. Comprising over 2500 species, the composition and particularly the relationships among the major clades of this group have historically been contentious and defied phylogenetic resolution until very recently. Our classification reflects the most current available data, largely derived from published molecular phylogenetic studies. In comparison with the five-family (Aspleniaceae, Blechnaceae, Onocleaceae, Thelypteridaceae, Woodsiaceae) treatment of Smith & al., we recognize 10 families within the eupolypod II clade. Of these, Aspleniaceae, Thelypteridaceae, Blechnaceae, and Onocleaceae have the same composition as treated by Smith & al. Woodsiaceae, which Smith & al. acknowledged as possibly non-monophyletic in their treatment, is circumscribed here to include only Woodsia and its segregates; the other "woodsioid" taxa are divided among Athyriaceae, Cystopteridaceae, Diplaziopsidaceae, Rhachidosoraceae, and Hemidictyaceae. We provide circumscriptions for each family, which summarize their morphological, geographical, and ecological characters, as well as a dichotomous key to the eupolypod II families. Three of these familiesDiplaziopsidaceae, Hemidictyaceae, and Rhachidosoraceaewere described in the past year based on molecular phylogenetic analyses; we provide here their first morphological treatment.
41679270|Jumellea is an orchid genus centered on Madagascar but also occurs on some of the neighboring oceanic islands (the Mascarenes and Comoros) and in southern and eastern Africa. Prior to our study the genus contained ca. 55 morphologically distinct species, of which six are found in the Comoros (three endemic, three shared with Madagascar), nine in the Mascarenes (four endemic, four shared with Madagascar), two in southern and eastern Africa (both endemic), and 41 species endemic to Madagascar. We perform Bayesian and parsimony phylogenetic analyses of Jumellea based on combined chloroplast (matK, trnL-F, rpsl6,ycf1) and nuclear (nrlTS) data from 60 specimens representing 47 species, four subspecies, and two varieties of Jumellea: (1) to assess the phylogenetic value of growth form, leaf, bract and lip shape, and spur length, presently used for recognizing informal groups within the genus; and (2) to test the monophyly of some variable species (e.g., J. gracilipes, J. lignosa). We find no support for the informal groups of Jumellea, as all the characters tested are evolutionarily labile. Jumellea lignosa (comprising J. lignosa subsp. lignosa, subsp. tenuibracteata, subsp. acutissima, and subsp. latilabia) is not monophyletic unless subsp. tenuibracteata is excluded. Jumellea gracilipes s.1. (including J. ambongensis, J. imerinensis, and J. unguicularis) is polyphyletic. As a result, we resurrect these three latter species, and recognize J. lignosa subsp. tenuibracteata at species level. Furthermore, we propose new circumscriptions for the following species: the Comorian J. arachnantha (including the Malagasy J. sagittata); the Reunionese J. exilis (including the Malagasy J. flavescens); the Reunionese J. recta (including the Malagasy Jumellea sp. 1); the Reunionese J. recurva (including the Malagasy J. pandurata); and the Reunionese J. stenophylla (including the Malagasy J. gracilipes 2 and 3). Finally, Jumellea arborescens and J. maxillarioides are recorded from Madagascar and the Comoros. Finally, the number of species of Jumellea has now increased from 55 to 57: seven species in the Comoros (four shared with Madagascar), nine species in the Mascarenes (four shared with Madagascar), two species in Africa, and 39 species, three subspecies, and two varieties restricted to Madagascar.
41679271|Dasymaschalon and the closely related genera Desmos, Friesodielsia and Monanthotaxis together comprise ca. 170 species of trees, shrubs and woody climbers distributed in tropical Africa and tropical Asia. These genera form the desmoid clade, which, because of the presence of diverse flower and fruit syndromes including different types of pollination chambers and moniliform monocarps, offers an opportunity to investigate potentially ecologically significant shifts in flower and fruit characters. Despite its morphological diversity, however, generic delimitation within the desmoid clade is problematic and the intergeneric relationships of the constituent genera are only poorly understood. Bayesian, maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony analyses of plastid DNA sequence data (matK, psbA-trnH, ndhF, rbcL, trnL-F; ca. 5.4 kb; 52 taxa) were used to clarify phylogenetic relationships within the desmoid clade. The evolution and taxonomic utility of selected fruit and flower characters was investigated with likelihood and parsimony ancestral character reconstructions. The results indicate problems in the current delimitations of Dasymaschalon and Friesodielsia. Friesodielsia as currently circumscribed is polyphyletic, with African Friesodielsia species allied to the African genus Monanthotaxis, and only distantly related to Asian representatives. The majority of Dasymaschalon species form a strongly supported clade, but three species are more closely related to Asian species of Friesodielsia. Ancestral character reconstructions indicate that seed number and monocarp shape are of limited value in generic circumscriptions, and that the three-petalled corolla characteristic of Dasymaschalon evolved independently twice within the desmoid clade. Disruptions to homeotic gene expression or strong selective pressure for a partial enclosure of the mature stamens and carpels by the corolla are hypothesised to underlie the parallel evolution of pollination chambers formed by outer petal homologues subsequent to inner petal loss.
41679272|Meiogyne (Annonaceae) comprises 15 species of trees and shrubs distributed in India, Indomalaya and Australasia-Pacific. Previous molecular phylogenetic analyses, based on limited taxon sampling, have indicated that the small genus Fitzalania (2 spp.) is nested within Meiogyne. The centre of diversity of the Meiogyne-Fitzalania group lies in Australia (6 spp.) and New Caledonia (4 spp.); this is unique in Annonaceae, some of whose Australian and New Caledonian lineages have been hypothesised to have originated in situ from Gondwanan ancestors. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on chloroplast DNA sequence data of 19 accessions, representing 14 of the 17 species in the Meiogyne-Fitzalania group (ca. 8.6 kb) as well as 67 representatives of all major clades of Annonaceae (ca. 5.1 kb), were performed to clarify the phylogenetic relationships of Meiogyne and Fitzalania. The results show that Fitzalania is deeply nested within an Australasian-Pacific clade of Meiogyne species. The inclusion of species assigned to Chieniodendron and Oncodostigma in Meiogyne, as proposed in the most recent revision of Meiogyne, is also corroborated. Fossil-calibrated molecular divergence estimates under an uncorrelated-rates relaxed molecular clock model were used to investigate the timing of the crown group diversification. The Meiogyne crown group was inferred to have originated in the late Oligocene or Miocene, and initially diversified in continental Southeast Asia, western Malesia and the Philippines. All Australasian-Pacific taxa formed a single derived clade, and most diversification within this clade occurred in the late Miocene and Pliocene. A complex combination of factors such as fragmentation of once wider distribution areas due to climate fluctuations and subsequent vicariance, range expansion by dispersal to Pacific islands and subsequent differentiation, and ecological adaptation to local climatic and edaphic habitat conditions is hypothesised to underlie the diversification of Meiogyne in Australasia and the Pacific.
41679273|The endemic Hawaiian genus Schiedea has among the most architecturally complex flowers of any genus of Caryophyllaceae. To understand the developmental basis of the unusual floral features that characterize Schiedea, we studied the floral organognesis of 6 of the 34 species of the genus using SEM, supplementing these observations with a focused investigation of nectary histology. The early ontogeny of Schiedea flowers is like that of many other Caryophyllaceae in that: (1) the five sepals are initiated in a 2/5 spiral, with the first, antesepalous whorl of stamens initiated in an imperfectly contrarotating sequence relative to the sepals; (2) the alternisepalous stamen whorl initiates slightly external to and at a lower level on the floral apex than the antesepalous whorl; and (3) petal primordia, if initiated (rare), arise on a primordium common with an alternisepalous stamen. Hence, most floral features that distinguish the genus, such as the (often) reflexed sepals and elongate stamen filaments, arise late in floral ontogeny. The only unique trait to Schiedea flowers are the elongate, tubular nectary extensions. They are antesepalous and arise from the abaxial surface of a ring-shaped proliferation of tissue that surrounds the bases of the developing stamens. The shape of each nectary in early ontogeny is highly similar to the mature "swallow's nest" nectaries present in many genera of a major crown clade of Caryophyllaceae (Pleurcaryophyllaceae, containing Schiedea), suggesting that the development of the needle-to scale-like nectary extensions of Schiedea might represent terminal additions onto a "swallow's nest" nectary ontogenetic program.
41679274|Since the first collection in 1910, botanists have recognized Sarcopilea (Urticaceae) as a dramatic example of convergence with succulent woody members of Crassulaceae. Phylogenetic analyses based on nuclear ribosomal DNA ITS and the trnL-F non-coding plastid DNA regions place Sarcopilea in a Neotropical clade of Pilea. A study of the cystolith, pollen and achene morphology, and of hydathode, hydrenchyma, and stomata position was also performed, confirming the molecular results. Across Rosales, leaf succulence is restricted to the genera Pilea and Sarcopilea. Furthermore, all succulent species of Pilea have an abaxial water-storage hydrenchyma layer in their leaves, a condition unique to the genus. The conditions of adaxial stomata (epistomatic, hyperstomatic), as well as hydathodes restricted to the submarginal abaxial leaf surface, were found in all Neotropical leaf-succulent species. Carbon isotope-ratio mass spectroscopy shows Sarcopilea to have C photosynthesis, therefore Crassulacean acid metabolism is still unknown in Rosales. The impact of molecular systematics of Caribbean endemic genera is discussed. In light of the new phylogenetic placement of Sarcopilea, a replacement name is provided (Pilea fair childiana).
41679275|Capparaceae (Brassicales) as traditionally circumscribed is heterogeneous, and several genera have been segregated from it based on molecular and/or morphological data. However, Borthwickia and Stixis, two Southeast Asian endemic genera of Capparaceae with controversial positions, have not previously been evaluated in a molecular phylogenetic study. Here, we used four plastid DNA regions (matK, ndhF, rbcL, trnL-trnF) and pollen data to determine their phylogenetic relationships within core Brassicales. Our results showed that neither Borthwickia nor Stixis is a member of Capparaceae. The two genera, together with Forchhammeria, Gyrostemonaceae, Resedaceae, and Tirania, formed a clade with strong support. Stixis is closely related to Tirania, a relationship that is also supported by morphological characters, such as six sepals and three-or four-locular ovaries. Most interestingly, Borthwickia was resolved as sister to the Forchhammeria-RGSQaacQae-Stixis-Tirania clade with moderate to strong support. However, Borthwickia differs markedly from its sister group in having opposite leaves, one indistinct stigma, more than four carpels and locules, a linear ovary with ridges, and pollen grains with perforate exine sculpturing. Thus, we describe a new family, Borthwickiaceae, for the genus.
41679276|A phylogeny of Dombeya and near relatives is hypothesized from a combined analysis of five noncoding plastid markers and ITS using parsimony and Bayesian methods, and their taxonomy is evaluated by a synthesis of morphological observations with the molecular phylogeny. The topology of the combined analysis of all molecular markers generally corresponds with morphology and includes four major groups. The majority of the Malagasy species, a portion of Mascarene species, and all African species of Dombeya sampled form a monophyletic clade, which is defined as Dombeya s.str. A second clade includes those taxa with winged seeds: Helmiopsis, Helmiopsiella, D. linearifolia and the highly apomorphic Eriolaena. These data and morphology support the transfer of D. linearifolia to Helmiopsis. A third clade of D. subsect. Macranthae plus D. moratii is well supported by both morphological and molecular data; these taxa are segregated from Dombeya as the new genus Andringitra. The fourth clade contains Mascarene endemics: Trochetia, Ruizia, and a portion of the Dombeya from these islands. Two clades within Dombeya s.str. provide evidence against some currently recognized subsections within the genus that are based on inflorescence and androecial characters.
41679277|Extensive efforts have been made to resolve the phylogeny of the large coffee family (Rubiaceae) based on molecular data. As a result, several small tribes have been described, but the phylogenies and generic delimitations for many of these groups remain unclear. This study focuses on the small tribe Danaideae that belongs to subfamily Rubioideae and whose generic limits have not previously been addressed with molecular data. It is the sole rubiaceous tribe distributed almost entirely in the Western Indian Ocean region, with the exception of the East African Danais xanthorrhoea. The tribe consists of three genera: Danais, Payera (including the monotypic genus Coursiana), and Schismatoclada. We present the first molecular phylogenetic study of Danaideae including representatives from all three genera and using Bayesian and maximum parsimony methods and sequence data from nuclear DNA (nrlTS) and chloroplast DNA (petD, psbA-trnH, rp132-trnLUAG, rps16). Our main objectives were to rigorously test the monophyly of Danaideae as currently circumscribed and assess phylogenetic relationships within the tribe. The findings of this study shed light on the colonization history of the tribe. Our analyses reaffirm the monophyly of Danaideae and Danais but reveal the paraphyly of Payera and Schismatoclada. The close relationship between the three Danaideae genera and Coursiana is supported. However, we found very little support for the inclusion of the latter genus in Payera as proposed earlier. The tribe is resolved in two morphologically distinct major lineages, the highly supported Danais clade with lianescent habit (= Danais sensu Buchner & Puff) and the Payera-Schismatoclada clade with arborescent habit. The Malagasy and Mauritian specimens of Danais fragrans are not closely related, and we restrict D. fragrans to the Mauritian taxa and resurrect Danais lyallii Baker to accommodate the Malagasy D. fragrans. According to our analysis, Madagascar is the origin of all species of Danaideae occurring in the Comoro archipelago, East Africa, and Mauritius. The Mauritian and East African Danais each is the result of a single colonization event, while there were at least two independent colonization events to the Comoros.
41679278|We took a two-tiered approach to test monophyly of Nelsonioideae and place the group within Lamales, and to determine relationships among taxa within the group. Phylogenetic analysis of a molecular dataset (ndhF+trnL-F) for a broad sample of Lamiales supports monophyly of Nelsonioideae and places the clade with strong support as sister to a lineage composed of all other plants treated as Acanthaceae (Avicennia, Thunbergioideae, Acanthoideae). We propose to treat this entire group as Acanthaceae s.l. and hypothesize that indurate, explosively dehiscent capsules are a synapomorphy for the family, albeit with autapomorphic fruit types in Avicennia and Mendoncia. These results further support monophyly of family-level groups that have emerged from recent studies of Lamiales but are largely unsuccessful in resolving relationships among these groups, as also encountered by other workers. Our results contradict some aspects of relationships that have seemed resolved by earlier studies, notably among Byblidaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Thomandersia, and other Lamiales. Among Nelsonioideae, analysis of sequence data from rapidly evolving genie regions (trnS-G,ndhF-rpl32+rpl32-trnL(UAG),nrITS) and a larger sample of nelsonioids (i.e., all genera and multiple taxa to represent the diversity of species-rich genera) indicates that Nelsonia and Elytraria are monophyletic with strong support, but with only moderate support for Nelsonia as the first branching clade and Elytraria sister to the remaining nelsonioids. An African clade comprising monospecific Saintpauliopsis sister to Anisosepalum (two of three species sampled) is sister to a clade that includes all sampled members of pantropical Staurogyne plus New World Gynocraterium and Asian Ophiorrhiziphyllon. Gynocraterium is sister to all sampled members of New World Staurogyne; this last clade is sister to a clade comprising the other sampled Staurogyne plus Ophiorrhiziphyllon, which is nested among Asian Staurogyne. The taxonomic implications of these patterns of relationship are discussed. Our results suggest that Nelsonioideae have a complex history of inter-continental dispersals compared to other lineages of Acanthaceae of similar to much larger size in terms of number of species, making it an interesting group for biogeographic study.
41679279|Increasingly complex likelihood-based methods are being developed to infer biogeographic history. The results of these methods are highly dependent on the underlying model which should be appropriate for the scenario under investigation. Our example concerns the dispersal among the southern continents of the grass subfamily Danthonioideae (Poaceae). We infer ancestral areas and dispersals using likelihood-based Bayesian methods and show the results to be indecisive (reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo; RJ-MCMC) or contradictory (continuous-time Markov chain with Bayesian stochastic search variable selection; BSSVS) compared to those obtained under Fitch parsimony (FP), in which the number of dispersals is minimised. The RJ-MCMC and BSSVS results differed because of the differing (and not equally appropriate) treatments of model uncertainty under these methods. Such uncertainty may be unavoidable when attempting to infer a complex likelihood model with limited data, but we show with simulated data that it is not necessarily a meaningful reflection of the credibility of a result. At higher overall rates of dispersal FP does become increasingly inaccurate. However, at and below the rate observed in Danthonioideae multiple dispersals along branches are not observed and the correct root state can be inferred reliably. Under these conditions parsimony is a more appropriate model.
41679280|In 1982, Ren Chang Ching twice described the same lycophyte species under the names Lycopodium mingcheense (published in April; the original "minchegense" spelling being a correctable error) and Phlegmariurus mingcheensis Ching (published in May). Phlegmariurus mingcheensis cannot be taken as a combination based on Lycopodium mingcheense because in the original publication a different holotype was indicated and the name Lycopodium mingcheense was not mentioned. The correct names for this species in Huperzia, Lycopodium, and Phlegmariurus are Huperzia mingcheensis (Ching) Holub (basionym: Phlegmariurus mingcheensis), Lycopodium mingcheense Ching, and Phlegmariurus mingcheensis Ching, respectively. The recent lectotypification of the name Lycopodium mingcheense using P.S. Chiu 2069 (PE) was redundant since this specimen was clearly indicated as the holotype in Ching's original publication. The recent new name Phlegmariurus mingjoui X.C. Zhang is an illegitimate superfluous name.
41679281|The widely cultivated Leyland cypress, a hybrid between Nootka cypress and Monterey cypress that was originally named Cupressus leylandii, exemplifies the instability of names of nothogenera when there are changes in generic placement of the parental taxa. Because of recent phylogenetic research, the parent species of Leyland cypress have each been put in four different genera, leading to 13 possible nothospecific names for this hybrid. Here we present the correct nomenclature for the Leyland cypress under these different taxonomic concepts. We also propose a new nothogenus, Hesperotropsis, for crosses between Hesperocyparis and Callitropsis, and publish three new combinations in Hesperotropsis, including Hesperotropsis leylandii for the Leyland cypress.
41679282|This paper accounts for all the names published by A. Peter in his account of Convolvulaceae for Engler and Prantl's Die natrlichen Pflanzenfamilien. In total, 31 Peter names in Convolvulaceae, 22 new species and 9 new combinations, are resolved in this paper. The taxonomy, nomenclature, and relevant literature are discussed for each name. Lectotypes or neotypes are chosen for some names that have not previously been typified.
41679304|For the first time in bryophyte studies, we performed comprehensive cloning of the ITS region to reveal intraindividual variation of ITS sequences. We assessed relationships among morphologically defined taxa of the polyploid complex of the moss Tortula muralis. Our results detected a monophyletic T. muralis complex comprising T. muralis subsp. muralis, T. muralis subsp. obtusifolia, T. lingulata, T. Israelis, and T. edentula. The single accession of T. edentula was found nested within T. obtusifolia, and biphyletic T. israelis was found to be nested within T. muralis. With the exception of T. lingulata, intragenomic ITS sequence variation was high in the T. muralis complex. Most intraindividual sequences were nevertheless only weakly divergent, suggesting their origin via mutations exceeding the rates of concerted evolution. Markedly divergent sequences found within a single individual most probably resulted from gene flow among distant lineages of the complex. Such pattern of ITS variation challenges the traditional morphology-based taxonomy. No phylogenetic signal was associated with ploidy-level variation, suggesting a polytopic origin of the diploids. Interestingly, the pattern of ITS variation together with morphological evidence indicate the autopolyploid origin of some lineages, which renders the T. muralis complex the first group of mosses in which autopolyploidy is implied by molecular markers.
41679305|Species delimitation remains a central problem in systematic, taxonomic and evolutionary studies. However, the precise delimitation of species depends on the criteria used to identify lineages and the specific species concept that is applied. Recently, multidisciplinary studies using different data sources have significantly improved the delimitation of species within complex taxonomic groups, leading to an integrative taxonomy. To investigate the species delimitation within the Atlantic clade of Epidendrum (subg. Amphyglottium), four different species criteria were examined (phenetic differentiation, monophyly, diagnosability, absence of genetic intermediates). Morphometrics, plastid DNA sequences and nuclear microsatellite markers were used to explore the agreement between patterns recovered and species criteria tested. The conflicts among species criteria are discussed in light of pollination ecology, patterns of gene flow, reproductive isolation mechanisms and selective pressures currently acting in deceptive orchid species. Four currently recognized species from the Atlantic clade could be delimitated, including one newly described species, Epidendrum flammeus. Three out of five species satisfied the monophyly criterion, and few diagnostic flower characters were found among species. In contrast, nuclear microsatellite data correctly assigned individuals to their respective species, even in the presence of weak reproductive isolation and extensive hybridization events reported in the literature. One important implication of this finding is that phylogenetic studies in Epidendrum spp. should make use of single-or low-copy nuclear loci instead of plastid markers, which may be true for other plant groups. The results also indicate that the generalized pollination syndrome found among species of the Atlantic clade, the different levels of gene flow observed between nuclear and plastid markers, and hybridization events are commonly observed as the main evolutionary forces within this orchid group. Finally, we discuss evolutionary processes and taxonomic limits among these species, and we highlight the need to increase the inter-disciplinary approach to investigate species limits in complex plant groups.
41679306|The ongoing realignment of angiosperm classification to create monophyletic groups is associated with the publication of numerous new combinations to transfer species between genera. How many species names will change in total? We use Poaceae as a model group to estimate the total number of name changes. We compare the species names accepted by the traditional classification system in GrassBase with the species names accepted by the recent research results compiled in GrassWorld. We estimate that 10%20% of Poaceae species will have moved to a different genus by the time the realignment is complete. This is the first published estimate for a number of name changes associated with classification realignment to monophyletic groups.
41679307|Curcuma comprises 120 species that occur throughout tropical and subtropical Asia. The taxonomy of the genus is haunted by polyploid speciation and homoploid hybridization, making it the most challenging genus in Zingibereae (Zingiberaceae). Curcuma is best known for turmeric (C. longa), but numerous species are extensively used as medicinal plants, ornamentals, and sources of starch, among many other uses. The delimitation of the genus has been a matter of dispute since its establishment by Linnaeus (1753), and further conflict has arisen from recent molecular and morphological studies suggesting either paraphyly of Curcuma or the necessity to broaden the genus to include four small genera (Laosanthus, Paracautleya, Stahlianthus, Smithatris) as well as several species currently placed in Kaempferia and Hitchenia. All previous infrageneric classifications were based on limited material that did not include species from the Indochinese floristic region, and these classifications are unable to unequivocally accommodate all currently known members of the genus. To test the monophyly and delimitation of Curcuma and to gain more insight into infrageneric relationships, three plastid regions (trnL-trnF, psbA-trnH, matK) and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of nuclear ribosomal DNA were sequenced. Fifty Curcuma species covering the morphological and geographic variation of the genus and 12 Curcuma-like species currently or previously treated as members of other genera were included in this study. In addition, four Zingibereae and three other Zingiberaceae species were used as outgroups. The results of maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses clearly support a broad generic boundary for Curcuma, with inclusion of Laosanthus, Paracautleya, Stahlianthus, Smithatris and some species of Kaempferia and Hitchenia (K. scaposa, K. candida, H. caulina, H. glauca). Four main groups in Curcuma s.l. were detected, and their importance for classification at the subgenus level is discussed. A new infrageneric classification is proposed here with a formal description of a new subgenus. Cloning uncovered a broad range of variation of ITS sequences within individuals, particularly in the terminal 'Curcuma' group containing representatives of the nominal subgenus Curcuma. This 'intra-individual ITS polymorphism' increases with ploidy level and is coupled with preferred vegetative reproduction. Additional studies are needed to further uncover highly complex relationships in this subgenus.
41679308|Euphorbia subg. Chamaesyce contains around 600 species and includes the largest New World radiation within the Old World-centered genus Euphorbia. It is one of the few plant lineages to include members with C, C and CAM photosynthesis, showing multiple adaptations to warm and dry habitats. The subgenus includes North American-centered groups that were previously treated at various taxonomic ranks under the names of "Agaloma", "Poinsettia", and "Chamaesyce". Here we provide a well-resolved phylogeny of Euphorbia subg. Chamaesyce using nuclear ribosomal ITS and chloroplast ndhF sequences, with substantially increased taxon sampling compared to previous studies. Based on the phylogeny, we discuss the Old World origin of the subgenus, the evolution of cyathial morphology and growth forms, and then provide a formal sectional classification, with descriptions and species lists for each section or subsection we recognize.
41679309|Balsamocarpon, Lophocarpinia, Stenodrepanum and Zuccagnia are monospecific endemic genera from arid or saline areas of southern South America (Argentina, Paraguay, Chile). Several molecular studies have explored relationships within Caesalpinioideae and the Caesalpinia group but, until now, Stenodrepanum has not been included, Lophocarpinia has been poorly represented and these four South American taxa have not been analyzed together. In order to resolve their evolutionary relationships, a phylogenetic analysis of the plastid trnL-F intron and spacer region that included a broad range of published sequences from Caesalpinieae was used. Combined trnL-F, matKltrnK and morphological data were analysed for a subset of taxa. Stenodrepanum, Balsamocarpon and Zuccagnia formed a monophyletic group with the amphitropical American genus Hoffmannseggia. The clade shares a synapomorphy of sepal persistence in the fruit. Lophocarpinia is shown also to belong to the Caesalpinia informal generic group as traditionally proposed, and grouped with Haematoxylum with which it shares the presence of branches and inflorescences crowded on short shoots and spines derived from branches. As a contribution to the understanding of the Caesalpinia group, phylogenetic hypotheses were used to discuss evolution of selected characters within the group.
41679310|A revised phylogeny of Tylophorinae, based on 77 species of all genera presently attributed to the subtribe (Biondia, Blyttia, Diplostigma, Goydera, Pentatropis, Pleurostelma, Rhyncharrhena, Tylophora, Vincetoxicum) is presented. Five choloroplast markers (trnT-L, trnL-F, and psbA-trnH intergenic spacers as well as the trnL and trnG introns) and two nuclear markers (ITS, ETS) were used, totalling in 3809 base pairs. Tylophorinae are strongly monophyletic and consist of several well-defined clades. Backbone resolution between these clades is low, indicating a rapid early radiation. Pentatropis is sister to all remaining taxa, albeit with weak support; all other taxa form one big clade not corresponding to previous generic delimitations. Therefore, all genera except for Pentatropis are subsumed under Vincetoxicum. The early branching clades of Vincetoxicum s.l. all grow in Africa, where the group originated ca. 18 Ma ago, correlating with the closure of the Tethys Ocean. The first round of differentiation took place between 12 and 15 Ma ago, resulting in Tylophorinae being distributed over almost all of their present range except for South Africa, Arabia and Europe. Two unrelated lineages of temperate, mostly erect plants hitherto named "Vincetoxicum" have arisen from more tropical lineages, hitherto named "Tylophora". One clade of African species is nested inside the Australasian assemblage; this clade contains exclusively polyploid species and its re-immigration to Africa took place in the Messinian, at ca. 6.8 Ma. The European Vincetoxicum species split from erect steppe plants of temperate Asia at ca. 4.5 Ma, coinciding with the uplift of the Tibetan plateau. This group contains two species that are presently aggressively spreading in North America after chance introductions.
41679311|The taxonomic histories and generic delimitations of the Andean-Subantarctic genera Azorella, Laretia, and Mulinum are among the most complex in Apiaceae subfam. Azorelloideae. To understand the evolutionary underpinnings of this complexity, we reconstructed the phylogenetic and biogeographic relationships of these genera, using for the first time a sampling strategy that includes all of their recognized species as well as representatives from the related genera Huanaca, Schizeilema, and Stilbocarpa. Sequences from the plastid rpll6 intron and trnD-trnT region were generated and phylogenies based on maximum likelihood, parsimony, and Bayesian inference were compared. The resulting phylogenies show many areas of disagreement with the current taxonomic circumscription of the genera. Four genera (Azorella, Mulinum, Huanaca, Schizeilema) are not monophyletic, and a fifth, Laretia, is embedded in one of the Azorella subclades. Each of the two large clades, informally named the "Mulinum clade" and the "Schizeilema clade", include species currently placed in Azorella. The "Mulinum clade" is further divided into six subclades, which collectively include 23 of 26 species of Azorella, the monotypic Laretia and all species of Mulinum. Biogeographic reconstructions, conducted using RASP, suggest that the group most likely has an Austral-Antarctic origin, with subantarctic South America as the ancestral area of the ingroup. The "Mulinum clade" and the "Schizeilema clade" appear to have followed opposite dispersal routes out of subantarctic South America either across the Subantarctics into New Zealand and Australia ("Schizeilema clade"), or into Patagonia and then to the upper Andes ("Mulinum clade").
41679312|Polyploidy is one of the major evolutionary forces in plants and in particular in the largest angiosperm family, the Asteraceae. This chromosome set multiplication directly impacts the nuclear DNA contents, in terms of variation at holoploid and monoploid levels. Other karyological changes such as aneuploidy or dysploidy might produce genome size alterations as well, therefore playing also a relevant role as evolutionary forces. All these factors may promote speciation, thus having systematic implications. In this paper we review the mechanisms associated with genome size variation, as well as their evolutionary consequences at phylogenetic, systematic and even taxonomic levels. To do so, C-values and chromosome numbers have been compiled and complemented with other molecular cytogenetic data to be discussed within their respective molecular phylogenetic frameworks. The case studies come from several genera of the Asteraceae belonging to tribes Anthemideae (Artemisia) and Cardueae (Cheirolophus, Echinops and members of Rhaponticum group), which cover a wide range of life strategies (e.g., life cycles, ecology, geographical distribution).
41679313|The recent English translation of the diary of the Swedish naturalist Daniel Rolander (written 1754-1756) reveals the earliest records on useful plants of Suriname. Since he did not grant Linnaeus access to his specimens, Rolander never received credit for his work, part of his collection was lost, and his diary never published. Here we compare Rolander's notes with recent ethnobotanical data from the Guianas and discuss how plant use has changed in the past 250 years. All species names in the diary with (potential) uses were updated to their current taxonomic status by using modern and historical literature, digitized Rolander specimens, herbarium collections and online nomenclatural databases. Rolander's diary lists uses for 263 plant names (228-242 spp.). Major use categories are medicine (109 spp.) and food (107 spp.). About 86% of these species are still used in Suriname today, 54% similarly as in the 1750s. Greatest correspondence was found among cultivated food crops, timber and ornamental species. Living conditions in Suriname have greatly improved since 1755, so much ancient famine food is now forgotten; while then popular fruits have become 'emergency food' today. Although ideas about health and illness have changed over the past centuries, uses have remained unchanged for 36% of the medicinal species. Rolander's diary contains first-hand observations on how plant uses were discovered, and how this knowledge was accumulated, transferred or kept secret in an 18th-century slave society. It represents one of the few historical sources that document the transfer of ethnobotanical knowledge among Amerindians, Europeans and Africans, as well as the trial-and-error process by which the enslaved Africans learned to use a new, American flora.
41679314|The typification of the names Chenopodium aristatum L. ( Teloxys aristata (L.) Moq.) and Chenopodium multifidum L. ( Dysphania multifida (L.) Mosyakin & Clemants) (Amaranthaceae) is discussed. Specimens from the Linnaean Herbarium (LINN) are designated as lectotypes for the names Chenopodium aristatum L. and Chenopodium multifidum L.
41679315|The name Carpinus ostrya L. is lectotypified on a specimen from the Linnaean Herbarium.
41679316|During a taxonomic revision of the genus Veronica L. for the Flora iberica project, an attempt was made to fix the correct status of the names cited in the study area. With this aim, here we have designated lectotypes, neotypes and epitypes for 18 previously untypified names, mainly belonging to annual species, some of them widely distributed such as V. persica and V. praecox. These newly proposed types support the current use of the names concerned and therefore contribute to establishing the correct nomenclature of the genus.
41679317|Bowerbank (1840) proposed Leguminosites for fossil seeds with uncertain affinities within Leguminosae Juss., but later workers demonstrated that his voucher specimens represent seeds of Magnolia L., Icacinicarya E. Reid & M. Chandler, genera of Sapindaceae Juss., and other non-legumes (e.g., Carpolithus Brongn.). Thus, Leguminosites, unless conserved, must be applied to non-legume entities under Art. 7.1 of the Vienna Code. Although more than 300 species of Leguminosites variously used for fossil legume leaves, fruits and seeds with uncertain affinities have been described by subsequent palaeobotanists, the legume identity of the majority of species names awaits confirmation by reinvestigation of the original materials and discovery of better preserved materials. Hence, conservation of Leguminosites may be premature for nomenclatural stability. It is suggested that the application of the fossil-generic name Leguminosites to isolated remains of more than one organ type should be avoided if the congeneric evidence for these organs is lacking. Therefore, isolated fossil legume leaves, fruits and seeds with uncertain affinities can be placed under at least three different fossil-generic names respectively in spite of the fact that they may, at least in part, apply to the same organism. It appears to be better to abandon Leguminosites and propose a new generic name for fossil legume seeds with uncertain affinities. Leguminocarpum Dotzler (1937) has priority over Leguminocarpon Gpp. ex Plfalvy (1951) for fossil legume fruits with uncertain affinities. Leguminophyllum A. Escalup-Bassi (1971) and Parvileguminophyllum Herend. & Dilcher (1990), which may be synonymous, can be used for fossil legume leaves with uncertain affinities.
41679341|As currently delimited, the Brassicaceae comprise 49 tribes, 321 genera, and 3660 species. Of these, 20 genera and 34 species remain to be assigned to tribes. These figures differ substantially from those estimated five years ago, in which 25 tribes, 338 genera, and 3709 species were recognized. Of those 338 genera, 37 are treated herein as synonyms, and 21 genera (10 re-established and 11 new) have since been added. The genera Notothlaspi, Peltariopsis, Sinapidendron, and Xerodrahu are lectotypified. The following 11 taxa are reduced for the first time to synonymy of what follows them in parentheses: Boreava and Tauscheria (Isatis), Catadysia (Weberbauerd), Coelophragmus (Dryopetalon), Crambeae (Brassiceae), Eremodraba (Neuontobotrys), Leavenworthieae (Cardamineae), Lexarzanthe (Romanschulzia), Noccaeopsis (Noccaea), Romanschulzia orizabae (R. arabiformis), and Sibaropsis (Streptanthus). The new names Isatis zarrei and I. quadrialata are proposed to avoid the creation of later homonyms upon the transfers to Isatis of the herein lectotypified Boreava orientalis and Sameraria nummularia, respectively. Twenty-seven new combinations are proposed: Abdra aprica, Camelinopsis kurdica, Dryopetalon auriculatum, Isatis aptera, I. cardiocarpa, I. glastifolia, I. gymnocarpa, Neuontobotrys intricatissima, N. schulzii, Noccaea apterocarpa, N. caespitosa, N. iberidea, N. oppositifolia, Onuris hauthalii, Parlatoria taurica, Petroravenia friesii, P. werdermannii, Streptanthus barnebyi, S. cooperi, S. hammittii, Tomostima araboides, T. australis, T. cuneifolia, T. platycarpa, T. reptans, T. sonorae, and Weberbauera rosulans.
41679342|Based on extensive molecular studies and critical evaluation of morphology, tribe Arabideae has recently been split into two tribes with the newly introduced tribe Stevenieae sister to the remaining members of tribe Arabideae. Tribe Stevenieae includes 11 species belonging to Pseudoturritis (1 sp.), Macropodium (2 spp.), and Stevenia (8 spp.). Tribe Arabideae includes about 488 species in 17 genera, and its taxonomy is highly affected by the previous para- and polyphyletic circumscription of Arabis. Here we segregate three morphologically similar but phylogenetically distinct new genera, Scapiarabis, Borodiniopsis, and Sinoarabis from Arabis (tribe Arabideae) and provide keys to the genera of Arabideae as currently delimited and to the four species of Scapiarabis. Four new combinations in Scapiarabis (S. ariana, S. karategina, S. popovii, S. saxicola), one in Borodiniopsis (B. alaschanica), and one in Sinoarabis (S. setosifolia) are proposed. Arabis kamelinii and A. kokanika are reduced to synonymy of Scapiarabis ariana and S. saxcola, respectively. It is shown that Scapiarabis forms a clade with the monotypic genera Botschantzevia, Arcyosperma, Parryodes, and Borodiniopsis. Biogeographically the whole clade forms a circle around the Asian high mountain system, which is interrupted and separated by genetically distinct members of the sister clade that includes Baimashania, Pseudodraba and Sinoarabis. The whole biogeographic scenario predates the Pleistocene, and the genera are of Pliocene origin.
41679343|Sequence data from the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) nrDNA and rbcL cpDNA regions were used to determine relationships of genera of Brassicaceae from Australia and New Zealand (NZ) that were previously unassigned to a tribe. Maximum likelihood analysis of 71 ITS sequences identified a monophyletic clade of Australian genera, including Carinavalva and Microlepidium that had previously been assigned to the tribe Microlepidieae. Pachycladon is not supported as monophyletic, comprising a clade of the NZ species and another clade of the Tasmanian P. radicatum. These two Pachycladon clades form a polytomy with the Australian clade. Maximum likelihood analysis of the rbcL region generally supports the ITS analysis with the Australian genera forming a monophyletic clade with Pachycladon. Arabidella is polyphyletic in the rbcL phylogeny as A. eremigena is member of the Australian clade but A. trisecta is placed in a sister clade that comprises mainly genera of tribe Camelineae. As a result of these phylogenetic analyses the tribe Microlepidieae is expanded and now includes 16 genera and 56 species endemic to Australia and New Zealand. Genera included in the Microlepidieae are Arabidella, Ballantinia, Blennodia, Carinavalva, Cuphonotus, Drabastrum, Geococcus, Harmsiodoxa, Irenepharsus, Menkea, Microlepidium, Pachycladon, Pachymitus, Phlegmatospermum, Scambopus and Stenopetalum. Whole-genome duplication has previously been shown to have occurred in the ancestry of Arabidella, Ballantinia, Pachycladon and Stenopetalum and is likely to be a defining feature of the tribe Microlepidieae. Future research needs to investigate circumscription of the Australian genera as there is a predominance of closely related monotypic genera in the Microlepidieae. With resolution of the tribal placement of these Australian and New Zealand genera, ca. 94% (302) of the 321 genera in the family have been assigned to a tribe.
41679344|Brassicas boast an enormous diversity of economically important products. Strikingly, relationships among main lineages are still unknown. The phylogeny of the tribe Brassiceae (Brassicaceae) was reconstructed for 89 species using four plastid regions (rpl32-trnL, atpI-atpH, psbD-trnT, ycf6-psbM). Representatives of almost all genera were sampled, covering the entire natural range of the tribe from Central Asia to the western Mediterranean, including four previously unsampled genera (Ammosperma, Eremophyton, Fezia, Pseudofortuynia). Phylogenetic analysis recovered eight well-supported clades in the tribe including a new African clade (Henophyton) comprised of genera that have not been previously sampled. Relationships within and between the eight major clades are strongly supported for the first time. The earliest-divergent lineages in the tribe are the clades Vella and Zilla. Henophyton is sister to the clade that includes the lineages Nigra, Crambe, Cakile, Savignya, and Oleracea. Core Brassiceaea new clade defined hereis comprised of two subclades: (1) Nigra, Crambe, and Cakile and (2) Savignya and Oleracea. Within the Oleracea lineage, a new Core Oleracea clade is defined. Several genera were confirmed to be polyphyletic or paraphyletic, including Brassica, Erucastrum, Sinapis, Diplotaxis and Cakile. Economically important species belonging to the genera Brassica were primarily distributed across the two most species-rich lineages, Nigra or Olercea. Collectively, the finding of these novel clades has numerous taxonomic implications.
41679345|The unigeneric tribe Heliophileae includes ca. 90 Heliophila species, all endemic to southern Africa. The tribe is morphologically the most diverse Brassicaceae lineage in every aspect of habit, foliage, flower and fruit morphology. Despite this diversity, virtually nothing is known about its origin and genome evolution. Here we present the first in-depth information on chromosome numbers, rDNA in situ localization, genome structure, and phylogenetic relationship within Heliophileae.Chromosome numbers determined in 27 Heliophila species range from 2n  16 to 2n = ca. 88, but 2n = 20 and 22 prevail in 77% of the examined species. Chromosome-number variation largely follows three major lineages (A, B, and C) resolved in the ITS phylogeny. Clade A species mostly have a chromosome number of 2n = 20, whereas 2n = 22 is the dominant number in clade C (2n = 16 and 22 were counted in two diploid species of clade B). The number and position of 5S and 45S rDNA loci vary between species and cannot be employed as phylogenetically informative characters. Seven species with different chromosome number and from the three ITS clades were analyzed by comparative chromosome painting. In all species analyzed, 90% of painting probes unveiled three homeologous chromosome regions in Heliophila haploid chromosome complements. These results suggest that all Heliophila species, and probably the entire tribe Heliophileae, experienced a whole-genome triplication (WGT) event. We hypothesize that the mesohexaploid ancestor arose through hybridization between genomes resembling the Ancestral Crucifer Karyotype with n = 8. The WGT has been followed by species-specific chromosome rearrangements (diploidization) resulting in descending dysploidy towards extant quasi-diploid genomes. More recent neopolyploidization events are reflected by higher chromosome numbers (2n = 3288). The WGT might have contributed to diversification and species radiation in Heliophileae. To our knowledge, this is the first study to document polyploidy as a potential major mechanism for the radiation of a Cape plant lineage.
41679346|We are developing an online-accessible knowledge and database system of cross-referenced information and resources on Brassicaceae (Cruciferae) taxonomy, systematics and evolution, including chromosome numbers, traits and characters, germplasm resources, and accurate enumeration of all species, genera and tribes. Biological, molecular and evolutionary knowledge is exponentially increasing in the mustard family. However, because of the complex and overwhelming biological diversity of the family, it is difficult to assess research results within a larger evolutionary framework. Many species have proven to be remarkable study objects but are rarely available. Biological material and resources, either collected directly in the wild or held in germplasm collections, have often been taxonomically misidentified; and only very rarely has the material been further characterized and documented. There is also no comprehensive survey of character and trait distribution among Brassicaceae lineages, though family-wide phytogenies are meanwhile available. In order to close these gaps, we will make accessible to the scientific community the research data focusing on adaptive characters and their evolution in the Brassicaceae. In this context, we will also provide a comprehensive documentation of the taxonomy and systematics of the entire family. This will include a database with all relevant taxonomic, systematic and phylogenetic literature, a comprehensive data collection of characters and traits, a DNA-based identification tool for genera and species, electronic interactive keys for the identification of genera and species, and a setup of a carefully selected and documented germplasm collection representing main lineages of the family. This knowledge database, hereafter BrassiBase, has been launched within the framework of the DFG priority programme SSP 1529 "Adaptomics  Evolutionary plant solutions to ecological challenges/Molecular mechanisms underlying adaptive traits in the Brassicaceae s.1."
41679347|The Paleotropical monocot family Pandanaceae includes ca. 700 species assigned to four genera: Pandanus (ca. 500 spp.), Freycinetia (ca. 200 spp.), Martellidendron (6 spp.) and Sararanga (2 spp.). The most speciose genus, Pandanus, was classically subdivided into eight subgenera. Previous cladistic analyses revealed that several key morphological characters might have evolved independently several times, thus highlighting the need for a robust molecular phylogenetic framework to elucidate phylogenetic relationships and infrafamilial and infrageneric classification within this group. In this study, three plastid DNA regions (matK, trnQ-rps16, trnL-trnF) and 200 individuals (representing 134 species and 609 newly produced sequences)spanning the taxonomic and biogeographic diversity of the familyare analyzed to test the monophyly at the familial and generic levels, and to infer phylogenetic relationships within the family. Particular emphasis is devoted to Pandanus with the aim of recognizing key morphological characters that reflect the evolutionary history of the genus. Phylogenetic inferences support the monophyly of Pandanaceae and establish Sararanga as sister to the rest of the family, with Freycinetia as sister to the Pandanus-Martellidendron pair. Although relationships are not well-resolved within the latter clade, three supported lineages are retrieved: (1) the Acrostigma clade comprising taxa of P. subg. Acrostigma, (2) the Martellidendron clade including taxa assigned to the genus Martellidendron and (3) the core Pandanus clade including taxa of all other subgenera of Pandanus. Morphological and biogeographic evidence supporting clade definitions are discussed in detail. This study provides the first phylogenetic backbone for Pandanaceae, which is sufficiently robust to serve as a springboard for future research into the evolutionary history of this neglected family.
41679348|The highly polyphyletic status of the species-rich genus Polyalthia (Annonaceae) remains one of the most significant impediments to revisionary and floristic taxonomic research in the family. Although Polyalthia has recently been reduced in taxonomic scope, the remaining species in the genus still form a phylogenetically disparate and morphologically heterogeneous assemblage. We use maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic reconstructions based on chloroplast DNA sequence data (matK, rbcL, trnL-F) to show that the remaining Polyalthia species segregate into three clades: a clade sister to Miliusa; a clade that also includes all Enicosanthum and Woodiellantha species sampled, sister to Neo-uvaria; and a clade that also includes all Haplostichanthus species sampled, inferred (based on previous research) to be sister to Popowia. Diagnostic morphological and anatomical characters are evaluated for the latter two clades, and diagnostic leaf and seed characters identified. Based on these results, the generic name Monoon is resurrected for the clade that includes Enicosanthum and Woodiellantha, following the transfer of 37 species from Polyalthia s.l., 18 species from Enicosanthum and the single Woodiellantha species. The generic name Haplostichanthus is furthermore synonymised with Polyalthia s.str., necessitating nine nomenclatural changes, including six new combinations and three replacement names.
41679349|Merianthera is a genus endemic to rocky outcrops in eastern Brazil, with seven species, four of which are new and described here (M. bullata, M. eburnea, M. parvifolia, M. verrucosa). The genus can be recognized by its caducous leaves, inferior ovaries and dry, rupturing fruits, as well as by the stamens with complex dorsal appendages. Merianthera is monophyletic, and sister to a clade consisting of Dolichoura, Behuria and Huberia (all from tribe Merianieae); together these four genera are sister to Cambessedesia, but not closely related to other genera in tribe Merianieae, such as Meriania and Graffenrieda. Within the genus, there are two distinct clades, the first with two species with thite to pink petals and leaves abaxially covered with a dense indument, both growing on sandstone and endemic to Minas Gerais (M. eburnea, M. sipolisii). The other clade comprises the remaining five species, all with glabrous or glabrescent leaves and purple petals, growing on granitic/gneissic outcrops and endemic to Esprito Santo (M. bullata, M. burlemarxii, M. parvifolia) or occurring in this state and also Minas Gerais (M. verrucosa) or in both plus Bahia (M. pulchra).
41679350|The genus Acosmium s.l. (Leguminosae: Papilionoideae) traditionally included up to 20 tree species mostly from South America. Due mainly to radial floral symmetry, the taxonomy of Acosmium has been historically confounded with four other Papilionoideae genera: Dicraeopetalum, Guianodendron, Leptolobium, and Sweetia. We used comprehensively sampled molecular data from the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS/5.8S) and two plastid DNA (matK, trnL intron) regions in order to evaluate the monophyly of Acosmium s.l. and to shed light on the relationships of its distinct lineages in the context of the Papilionoideae phylogeny. Parsimony and Bayesian analyses of all data concurred in resolving a polyphyletic Acosmium s.l. Our data agreed with previous molecular phylogenetic analyses that resolved Dicraeopetalum and Sweetia apart from Acosmium s.l. Unexpectedly, Acosmium s.str., thought to belong to the Genistoid clade, is here strongly resolved within the Dalbergioid Pterocarpus clade. Despite being classified until recently as different sections of Acosmium s.l., Leptolobium and Guianodendron were resolved within the Genistoid clade as part of a Bowdichia clade with the genera Diplotropis and Bowdichia. Our results reveal that radial floral symmetry has evolved independently in all Acosmium segregates and strongly suggest that the primacy given to floral characters involving corolla symmetry and petal differentiation in traditional legume classification has often obscured phylogenetic relationships.
41679351|The Neotropical Bowdichia clade (Leguminosae: Papilionoideae) comprises four genera, Bowdichia, Diplotropis, Guianodendron, and Leptolobium, which are sister to the core Genistoid clade. Bowdichia and Diplotropis at one time were treated as a single genus, whereas Guianodendron and Leptolobium have been synonymized with the distantly related Dalbergioid genus Acosmium because of shared radial floral symmetry. We combined and analysed morphological and molecular data including the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (ITS; including ITS1/5.8S/ITS2) and two chloroplast DNA (matK, trnL intron) regions in order to evaluate the monophyly of each genus and the Bowdichia clade. A combined parsimony analysis strongly supported the monophyly of Bowdichia, the paraphyly of Diplotropis, and the independent evolution of radial floral symmetry in Guianodendron and Leptolobium. Leptolobium is sister to Bowdichia and Guianodendron is nested within Diplotropis s.l. Diplotropis is here recircumscribed as to encompass the monophyletic Diplotropis sect. Diplotropis and it is suggested that D. sect. Racemosae deserves segregation into a new genus. Radial floral symmetry has been overemphasised in previous classifications by taxonomists who did not recognize its evolutionary lability. This has resulted in non-monophyletic circumscriptions of genera such as Acosmium.
41679352|A study of Flora Norvegica by Johan Ernst Gunnerus revealed that no less than 39 new species names were validly published in the work. Most of them have not previously been effectively typified, though several of the names are in current use. This is done here, except for those of three sponges (animals), four non-lichenized fungi and five mosses (those in the last-named group are pre-starting-point names). The names of two species, those currently known as Carex norvegica Retz. and Rhizocarpon oederi (Weber) Krber, would need to change as a result of this, unless conservation or rejection proposals to preserve these names are accepted.
41679353|"Embryophyceae" and Equisetopsida have been used recently to designate the land plants at the rank of class. The former was never validly published. In this paper we propose a new name in the rank of classEmbryopsida Engler ex Pirani & J. Prado, to replace Equisetopsida C. Agardh, which was used by Chase & Reveal (2009) to apply to all land plants. The new name here proposed follows Art. 16.1(b) of both the Vienna Code and the Melbourne Code and recognizes Adolf Engler's use of the term "Embryophyta" to name the land plants, i.e., all plants provided with an embryo.
41679354|A review of the name Polygala trichosperma, including its authority, orthography, and typification, is provided. It is determined that this name was first validly published by Jacquin and not Linnaeus. However, under the Code, the specific epithet's original spelling, "trichisperma" is to be corrected to "trichosperma", the spelling originally used by Linnaeus. The name P. trichosperma is lectotypified by a Jacquin specimen at BM.
41679355|The typifications of the names Celosia castrensis L., C. cristata L. and C. margaritacea L. (Amaranthaceae) are discussed. Specimens from the Linnaean and Clifford Herbaria are designated as the lectotypes.
41679356|The typification of the name Anabasis foliosa L. ( Neocaspia foliosa (L.) Tzvelev) (Chenopodiaceae) is discussed. A specimen from LINN is designated as the lectotype.
41679357|In Japan, there are two common suffruticose species of the genus Pertya Sch. Bip. (Asteraceae: Pertyeae), P. scandens (Thunb.) Sch. Bip. and P. glabrescens Sch. Bip. ex Nakai, the former with pilose stems and leaves and the latter with glabrous to glabrate stems and leaves. Recently, however, it was concluded that the two species should be referred to as P. ovata Maxim, and P. scandens, the application of the latter name shifting to the species with glabrous stems. The lectotype of Erigeron scandens Thunb. (P. scandens) was carefully examined and it was identified as the species with pilose stems and leaves. Pertya glabrescens Sch. Bip. ex Nakai was determined to be the correct name for the glabrous species. Lectotypes for P. glabrescens, as well as the synonyms P. scandens f. maximowicziana Franch., P. scandens f. schulziana Franch., and P. glabrescens var. viridis Nakai are designated.

24389105|In this paper, an extended molecular phylogeny was generated for the Ocellularia clade, which includes about half of the species that were previously separated in the family Thelotremataceae. Three genes (mtSSU, nuLSU, RPB2), from a total of 270 OTUs with 136 ingroup species, were sequenced to evaluate whether the core genera, Ocellularia and Myriotrema, form monophyletic clades or split into several lineages. Further, we tested the usefulness of phenotypic characters for circumscribing monophyletic groups. Besides a maximum likelihood analysis, we incorporated the novel method of morphology-based 'phylogenetic binning', which allowed us to weight the morphological characters in those taxa with molecular data available and then predict the phylogenetic classification for over 200 additional species for which no molecular data are currently available. Our results showed that the large general Myriotrema, Ocellularia, and Stegobolus are polyphyletic. For some of the previously unrecognized lineages, older generic names are available (Rhabdodiscus, Ocellis, Stigmagora, Antrocarpum, Macropyrenium). Some previously separated genera, such as Ampliotrema and Gyrotrema, were found to be nested within a large clade currently recognized as Ocellularia s.l. For this clade, no meaningful generic subdivision could be established based on the available data, and we proposed to recognize distinct subclades at the subgenus level. One new genus, Compositrema, was also discovered, and a second new genus, Glaucotrema, is established for the Myriotrema glaucophaenum group. Further, the genus Rhabdodiscus is reinstated formally. We found a high level of homoplasy (parallel evolution) of phenotype characters previously used for classification purposes, such as excipular carbonization, columella morphology, and ascospore size, septation, and pigmentation. Secondary chemistry, on the other hand, was remarkably uniform in most clades. Some clades also exhibit a high level of disparity of ascoma morphology. Thus, the very distinctive Gyrotrema-type apothecia occur in a clade nested within and genetically very similar to Ocellularia s.str.
24389106|Broad morphological variation and a complex taxonomic history suggest that Orthotrichum consimile, an epiphytic moss known from oceanic forests of western North America and western Europe, may be a complex of cryptic species rather than a single taxon. This hypothesis was tested through an integrative taxonomic approach combining morphological investigations and phylogenetic inferences from four chloroplast loci. We show that O. consimile is in fact a polyphyletic assemblage of four lineages, which can be diagnosed unambiguously on morphological characters. They are Orthotrichum consimile s.str., O. columbicum (resurrected from synonymy), O. persimile sp. nov. and O. confusum sp. nov. Except for O. columbicum, which has a trans-Atlantic distribution, these species are endemic to western North America. Phylogenetic inferences increasingly resolve cases of so-called cryptic speciation within bryophytes exhibiting broad geographic distributions. Almost invariably the hypothesis of cryptic differentiation remains untested. Here we show that parallel morphological and phylogenetic inferences can lead to the resolution of apparent incongruence and lead to the discovery of new, morphologically defined, species.
24389107|Dryopteris (Dryopteridaceae) is one of the largest fern genera containing about 300 or more species. Sixty-five accessions representing all four subgenera and all 19 sections of Dryopteris recognized in current classifications, more than two-thirds of the species of Acrophorus, Diacalpe, Nothoperanema, and Peranema, three species of Arachniodes, three species of Cyrtomium, one species of Phanerophlebia, and two species of Polystichum, were sampled as ingroup in this study. Two species of Polystichopsis were used as outgroups. DNA sequences of five plastid loci (psbA-trnH spacer, rbcL gene, rps4-trnS spacer, trnL intron, trnL-F spacer) were used to infer the phylogeny of Dryopteris and related genera. Our study clearly demonstrated that the currently defined Dryopteris is paraphyletic in relation to a clade containing the monophyletic Acrophorus, Diacalpe, Nothoperanema, and Peranema. Peranema is resolved as sister to the remaining three genera, followed by Nothoperanema which in turn is sister to the Acrophorus+Diacalpe clade, but this relationship received low support. Three out of the four subgenera of Dryopteris recognized in current classifications are not recovered as monophyletic. Dryopteris subg. Nothoperanema, well supported as monophyletic by molecular and morphological data, is resurrected and re-circumscribed to contain species of the currently accepted genera Acrophorus, Diacalpe, Nothoperanema, and Peranema. Twenty-seven species are recognized and classified into four sections based on molecular and morphological evidence. Included in this treatment are 25 new combinations, names, species, and statuses, and neotypification or lectotypification of 14 names. The present study further located and cited types of an additional 28 related names, many of which have been unknown to science. Keys to sections and species and distributional information are given and nomenclatural issues are discussed. This paper also synonymized and excluded 33 nomenclaturally confusing names of Dryopteris that were formerly assigned to Acrophorus or Diacalpe.
24389108|The systematics of the genus Arundo (Poaceae) remains poorly resolved because of the overlap of morphological characters classically used in the taxonomy of the genus and insufficient variation of DNA sequences. The main aim of this study is to delimit genetic clusters with AFLP fingerprints and to compare them with morphological data. On the basis of extensive sampling in the Mediterranean area, AFLP markers clearly showed five clusters. Despite overlapping values, morphometric analyses strongly confirm these clusters, and new qualitative features allow the recognition of five taxa: the Taiwanese A. formosana, the cosmopolitan A. donax, the circum-Mediterranean A. micrantha, the Italo-Balkan A. plinii and the Franco-Ligurian A. donaciformis (Loisel.) Hardion & al. comb. nov. Additionally, this study shows a correlation between genetic diversity, caryopsis production and ploidy level. However, the lack of genetic diversity for A. micrantha and A. donax in the Mediterranean area remains enigmatic.
24389109|Incongruence between morphology and molecules, i.e., genetic differentiation of lineages that are morphologically identical, or morphological variation among accessions sharing identical genotypes, has been increasingly reported and is most problematic in taxa with reduced morphologies. We here review and discuss these issues for plant taxonomy, taking Salicornia, one of the taxonomically most challenging genera of angiosperms, as a model. We argue in favour of a taxonomic system that remains as much 'workable' as possible for traditional morphology-based taxonomy, but avoids merging genetically widely divergent lineages despite their morphological similarity. Our revised classification of Eurasian taxa includes four species, ten subspecies and one nothosubspecies. The molecular and morphological characteristics as well as the geographical distribution of each taxon are described. A key to the Eurasian taxa based on morphology and geographical distribution is presented.
24389110|The genus Adansonia has a disjunct geographical distribution: six species are endemic in Madagascar, one in Africa, and one in Australia. The well-known African baobab (Adansonia digitata) is an iconic tree with considerable ethnobotanical significance. In contrast to the other seven species, which are diploid, A. digitata is tetraploid. A common ancestor of A. digitata and the other diploid baobab species would be diploid; however, there are no diploid species recorded on the African mainland. Examining variation in floral and pollen characters and chromosome number in specimens from Africa identified a new diploid baobab species, Adansonia kilima sp. nov., which co-exists with A. digitata in Africa. Adansonia kilima is restricted to moderate elevations (6501500 m), in contrast to A. digitata, which is widespread throughout Africa but prefers elevations below 800 m. Adansonia kilima is superficially similar to A. digitata, but can be differentiated on the basis of floral morphology, pollen, and chromosome number. We used two chloroplast DNA markers and the nuclear ITS to examine phylogenetic relationships within Adansonia. Three lineages were observed: one containing the Malagasy species, one containing the Australian species, and one containing the African species. The relationships between these clades were difficult to resolve, but a link between the African and Australian clades emerged when the analysis used fewer replicate samples of individual Malagasy taxa, included indel characters and included fewer outgroup taxa. The ITS phylogeny demonstrated that A. digitata and A. kilima are genetically similar, suggesting that tetraploidy evolved relatively recently.
24389111|In the past, the circumscription of the large genus Psychotria (Rubiaceae) was difficult, until molecular phylogenetic studies revealed its considerable paraphyly, enabling the delimitation of its major lineages and the grouping of related genera, and most notably the separation of Psychotria and its relatives (former Psychotrieae) into two tribes: Psychotrieae and Palicoureeae. The genus Margaritopsis, which is included in Palicoureeae, encompasses 27 Neotropical species, and in previous studies these have been shown to be close relatives of a group of eight Psychotria species that occur over a large region extending from South-East Asia to tropical South Pacific through Malesia (= the AMP region, defined as including South-East Asia, Malesia, tropical Australia, Melanesia, Micronesia, New Caledonia and Polynesia). A molecular phylogenetic study, using one nuclear DNA region (ITS) and four plastid DNA regions (ndhF, rps16, trnH-psbA, trnT-F), is undertaken in order to test the placement of 17 AMP Psychotria species within Palicoureeae. The phylogenetic results show that they form a monophyletic clade (= clade G), which also includes the monotypic Fijian genus Readea and Hodgkinsonia frutescens from Australia. Clade G is embedded in a well-supported grade with five Neotropical representatives of Margaritopsis. A morphological survey based on twenty characters, with the potential to circumscribe generic entities, shows that the monophyly of clade G is supported by a character combination that is similar to species of Neotropical Margaritopsis, confirming their inclusion in this genus. Taxonomic and nomenclatural work on these species is required to formalize nomenclatural implications. Based on the same set of morphological characters, but in absence of molecular data, 28 other Psychotria species from the AMP region were detected as likely candidates for inclusion in Margaritopsis, allowing the estimation of species richness of clade G to be a minimum of 47 species. Within clade G, five well-supported subclades and a Readea lineage are delimited and each of these is generally supported by unique morphological features. Phylogenetic topologies reveal biogeographical patterns, including a main route of dispersal from western to eastern parts of the AMP region, with subsequent dispersals between archipelagos in the region.
24389112|A molecular systematic approach using DNA sequences of two non-coding chloroplast loci (trnK, rps16) and the nuclear ITS region was applied to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships within the tribe Rhinantheae (Orobanchaceae). This tribe includes approximately 19 genera of hemiparasitic plants predominantly occurring in the Old World. An exception is the genus Bartsia which, according to previous taxonomic treatments, includes a remarkable radiation (ca. 45 species) in the Andes, two species distributed in Afromontane regions, and only one species (Bartsia alpina) ranging from the alpine mountains of northern and central Europe to northeastern North America. The present phylogenetic study includes the most comprehensive taxon sampling of Rhinantheae to date, with main focus on the relationships of the Mediterranean genera. Both nuclear and plastid datasets reveal a core group of Rhinantheae comprising four major lineages. Our analyses suggest that (1) the northern temperate Bartsia alpina is sister to the rest of the core group; (2) African Bartsia are more closely related to the monotypic African genus Hedbergia than to other congeneric taxa; (3) South American Bartsia are nested within a highly supported clade including Parentucellia and Bellardia; (4) Nothobartsia and Odontitella are likely to be the results of at least one intergeneric hybridization event. Despite topological conflicts regarding some taxa, the polyphyly of Bartsia and a broadly circumscribed Odontites are unambiguously supported by our results. Our tree topologies indicate that the importance of certain morphological characters traditionally used for generic delimitation (such as shape and indumentum of corolla, anthers, and capsules) has been overestimated, and that some of these characters are presumably convergent. Available information on chromosome numbers corroborates the results presented here.
24389113|The new genus Tribounia is described with two species, Tribounia venosa (Barnett) D.J. Middleton, a new combination, and Tribounia grandiflora D.J. Middleton, a new species. A key to the species and conservation assessments are provided.
24389114|The National Herbarium of the Netherlands houses a 17th century, bound herbarium containing 51 dried specimens from Suriname, which was composed by the well-known botanist Paul Hermann (16461695). This is considered as the oldest documented herbarium collection not only for Suriname but for the Guianas region. Most specimens are accompanied by (pre-Linnaean) Latin or vernacular names and sometimes by Latin descriptions of the plants and their uses. To assess the importance of this collection for the present-day flora and ethnobotany of Suriname, we identified all specimens (one by using ancient DNA analysis), translated the Latin texts, traced back the origin of the herbarium in national archives, 17th century and modern literature and compared plant names and uses with present-day ethnobotanical data. We digitized the entire herbarium and made it available online (http://www.hermann-herbarium.nl). The specimens were probably collected around 1687 by a certain Hendrik Meyer, who had a keen interest in botany and indigenous plant use. The 48 species in the herbarium are almost all useful plants: cultivated crops, wild edible fruits, medicinal plants, timber trees, fish poison, colorants and roof thatch material. Most species are used similarly today, and more than half of the vernacular names still exist in the region. The presence of Abelmoschus esculentus and Sesamum indicum in the herbarium prove the early establishment of African food plants in the emerging plantation economy of Suriname. Unlike Hermann's collections from Ceylon and the Cape, this herbarium was never seen by Linnaeus and therefore does not contain any type specimens.
24389115|Niu-chang-chih, a medicinal polypore restricted to Taiwan on the endemic tree species Cinnamomum kanehirae, currently goes by the names Antrodia cinnamomea T.T. Chang & W.N. Chou, A. camphorata (M. Zang & C.H. Su) Sheng H. Wu & al., and Taiwanofungus camphoratus (M. Zang & C.H. Su) Sheng H. Wu & al., the latter two based on Ganoderma camphoratum M. Zang & C.H. Su. The basidiocarps on the holotypes for the two basionyms Antrodia cinnamomea and Ganoderma camphoratum are of niu-chang-chih. The first validly published name that was applied to this species was G. camphoratum M. Zang & C.H. Su published in 1990. However, the original type of G. camphoratum consisted of mixed material, consisting chiefly of a basidiocarp of niu-chang-chih but also of the spores of another unrelated fungus. The two elements are represented in the original description and accompanying illustrations. Later Chang & Chou (2004) lectotypifed G. camphoratum limiting it to the spores described and illustrated by Zang and Su, the only portion of the original type that Chang and Chou believed to belong in Ganoderma, and applied the name Antrodia cinnamomea Chang & Chou (1995) to niu-chang-chih. Many, however, reject Chang and Chou's conclusions and continue to apply the name Ganoderma camphoratum, and combinations based on it (i.e., Antrodia camphoratum, Taiwanofungus camphoratus), to niu-chang-chih, relegating Antrodia cinnamomea to synonymy. Based on careful examination of the type of G. camphoratum, it is concluded that the spores upon which Chang and Chou's lectotype is based are a minor admixture with the original gathering of the niu-chang-chih specimen and thus cannot serve as the lectotype for the name Ganoderma camphoratum. Ganoderma camphoratum is lectotypified here so as to exclude the spores present in the original holotype that are not from niu-chang-chih. Furthermore, since this conclusion could be subject to challenge and the species is exceptionally important medicinally and economically, we also propose to conserve the name with a conserved type that is consistent with the lectotype effected herein. An overview of the taxonomy of niu-chang-chih is also provided and a new combination, Taiwanofungus salmoneus, for a related species is effected.
24389116|European taxonomists are divided regarding Quercus dalechampii, considering it either: (1) a distinct species close to Q. petraea, (2) a distinct species close to Q. pubescens, or (3) falling within the morphological variability of previously described species, including Q. petraea and Q. pubescens. These taxonomic disagreements are largely due to inconsistencies between the description of Q. dalechampii and much of its original material. In order to resolve these differing interpretations, all available original material was examined and a lectotype, superseding a previous neotype, was chosen from this material. The original material for the name consisted of mixed material belonging both to the Q. petraea complex and the Q. pubescens complex. The lectotype designated here is characterized by pubescent leaves and belongs to the Q. pubescens complex.
24389117|Eight names in Hieracium (H. atrovirens Froel., H. crinitum Sm., H. lucidum Guss., H. pallidum Biv., H. racemosum subsp. todaroanum Zahn, H. siculum Guss., H. siculum var. minus Guss., H. symphytifolium Froel.), the descriptions of which are based totally or in part on Sicilian material, are typified. Hieracium racemosum subsp. todaroanum is treated as a synonym of H. crinitum, and H. siculum and H. siculum var. minus are treated as synonyms of H. symphytifolium. Hieracium atrovirens is recognized as a subspecies of H. murorum L. (H. murorum subsp. atrovirens (Froel.) Raimondo & Di Grist.).
24389310|Monographs are fundamental for progress in systematic botany. They are the vehicles for circumscribing and naming taxa, determining distributions and ecology, assessing relationships for formal classification, and interpreting long-term and short-term dimensions of the evolutionary process. Despite their importance, fewer monographs are now being prepared by the newer generation of systematic botanists, who are understandably involved principally with DNA data and analysis, especially for answering phylogenetic, biogeographic, and population genetic questions. As monographs provide hypotheses regarding species boundaries and plant relationships, new insights in many plant groups are urgently needed. Increasing pressures on biodiversity, especially in tropical and developing regions of the world, emphasize this point. The results from a workshop (with 21 participants) reaffirm the central role that monographs play in systematic botany. But, rather than advocating abbreviated models for monographic products, we recommend a full presentation of relevant information. Electronic publication offers numerous means of illustration of taxa, habitats, characters, and statistical and phylogenetic analyses, which previously would have been prohibitively costly. Open Access and semantically enhanced linked electronic publications provide instant access to content from anywhere in the world, and at the same time link this content to all underlying data and digital resources used in the work. Resources in support of monography, especially databases and widely and easily accessible digital literature and specimens, are now more powerful than ever before, but interfacing and interoperability of databases are much needed. Priorities for new resources to be developed include an index of type collections and an online global chromosome database. Funding for sabbaticals for monographers to work uninterrupted on major projects is strongly encouraged. We recommend that doctoral students be assigned smaller genera, or natural portions of larger ones (subgenera, sections, etc.), to gain the necessary expertise for producing a monograph, including training in a broad array of data collection (e.g., morphology, anatomy, palynology, cytogenetics, DNA techniques, ecology, biogeography), data analysis (e.g., statistics, phylogenetics, models), and nomenclature. Training programs, supported by institutes, associations, and agencies, provide means for passing on procedures and perspectives of challenging botanical monography to the next generation of young systematists.
24389311|Large genera, that were defined using a restricted suite of morphological characters, are particularly prone to be polyphyletic. We analysed a representative selection of species traditionally assigned to the genus Barbula, believed to represent the largest genus of the moss family Pottiaceae, but which recently was suggested to be polyphyletic. Special attention was paid to species traditionally assigned to Barbula sect. Hydrogonium and sect. Convolutae, in which phylogenetic relationships are likely to be incongruent with morphological traits, which could have evolved in adaptation to hydric and otherwise extreme habitats. Our phylogenetic analysis was based on nrITS and chloroplast rps4 and trnM-trnV sequence data and resolved only the type of the genus, B. unguiculata, plus B. orizabensis, in subfamily Pottioideae, while most of the species occurring in the Northern Hemisphere are part of Trichostomoideae and need to be recognized within the re-established and partly re-defined genera Hydrogonium and Streblotrichum. The phylogenetically and morphologically divergent B. bicolor needs to be removed from Streblotrichum to a newly described genus, Gymnobarbula. Numerous taxonomic changes and nomenclatural novelties, resulting from the molecular, morphological and nomenclatural studies are proposed for taxa of Hydrogonium, particularly within the H. consanguineum clade. Lectotypes are selected for Tortula angustifolia Hook. & Grev. ( Hydrogonium angustifolium (Hook. & Grev.) Jan Kuera, comb. nov.), Tortula consanguinea Thwaites & Mitt. ( Hydrogonium consanguineum (Thwaites & Mitt.) Hilp.) and Tortula flavescens Hook. & Grev. ( Hydrogonium consanguineum (Thwaites & Mitt.) Hilp.).
24389312|We provide the first detailed description of specialized anatomical mechanisms of fruit dehiscence in two sections of Trithuria (Hydatellaceae), a basal angiosperm lineage with a markedly ascidiate carpel. The dehiscent fruits of Hydatellaceae are unique among angiosperms. Earlier studies suggested the follicle as a primitive type of dehiscent angiosperm fruit, developing from a conduplicate carpel. In contrast with follicles, the single-seeded apocarpous (or unicarpellate) dehiscent fruits of Hydatellaceae dehisce by three equally spaced valves separating from three fruit ribs. There is no evidence of pseudomonomery. In mature fruits, all cell layers except the outer epidermis of the ovary are obliterated, so that only one pericarp layer (the exocarp) remains, except in the regions around the vascular bundles and at the fruit apex and base. Morphological cladistic analyses reveal data incongruence between characters describing fruit morphology and other morphological features of Hydatellaceae, including those linked with dioecy/monoecy. As a result, strict consensus trees inferred from maximum parsimony analyses based on each of the two sub-sets of morphological data are more resolved than ones inferred from the analysis of the entire morphological dataset. Fruit characters correspond closely with the recently published molecular phylogeny of the sole genus, Trithuria. The occurrence of an apparently rudimentary mechanical tissue at the fruit apex of most Hydatellaceae with indehiscent fruits suggests that the stem group of Hydatellaceae was characterized by dehiscent fruits with lignified endocarp fibres. The occurrence of Strelitzia-type surface waxes characteristic of Trithuria sect. Trithuria provides further evidence of the homoplasy of this epicuticular wax type at the scale of seed plants.
24389313|Asphodelaceae subfam. Alooideae (Asparagales) currently comprises five genera, four of which are endemic to southern Africa. Despite their importance in commercial horticulture the evolutionary relationships among the genera are still incompletely understood. This study examines phylogenetic relationships in the subfamily using an expanded molecular sequence dataset from three plastid regions (matK, rbcLa, trnH-psbA) and the first subunit of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS1). Sequence data were analysed using maximum parsimony and Bayesian statistics, and selected morphological traits were mapped onto the molecular phylogeny. Haworthia is confirmed as being polyphyletic, comprising three main clades that largely correlate with current subgeneric circumscriptions. Astroloba and Gasteria are evidently each monophyletic and sister respectively to Astroloba and H. subg. Robustipedunculares. Chortolirion is shown to be deeply nested within Aloe and is formally included in that genus. Aloe itself is clearly polyphyletic, with the dwarf species A. aristata allied to Haworthia subg. Robustipedunculares. The taxonomic implications of these findings are examined but branch support at critical lower nodes is insufficient at this stage to justify implementing major taxonomic changes.
24389314|The orchid genus Epidendrum, with 1500 species occurring within the Neotropical region, represents a very promising model system for evolutionary and ecological studies offering an expanded repertoire of research opportunities in the breadth of modern plant biology. Epidendrum displays a significant degree of morphological variation, chromosome number diversity and ecological interactions, which challenges widely held views on reproductive barriers and habitat selection. The widespread geographical distribution of many species and populations offers interesting opportunities to investigate how climatic changes and historic demographic processes shaped the current patterns of genetic and species diversity across different biomes and landscapes. Questions involving chromosome barriers to gene exchange and the role of postzygotic genetic barriers in species cohesion (e.g., the contributions of habitat selection and niche divergence on species cohesion) could be easily addressed when using the variety of natural hybrid zones found across Epidendrum. Several key evolutionary questions could be addressed with this model system, such as the identification of the first stages of adaptive radiation, the evolution of pollination strategies, the adaptive ecological significance of trait variation and hybridisation, the influence of historical demographic events on lineage diversification and speciation. With the advance of cost-effective molecular techniques and by combining ecological and phenotypic data, researchers can now tackle these questions and foster significant progress in the field of Neotropical plant diversification and evolution.
24389315|Zhengyia shennongensis is described here as a new genus and species of the nettle family (Urticaceae) from Hubei province, central China. The phylogenetic position of Z. shennongensis is determined using DNA sequences of nuclear ribosomal ITS and three plastid regions (rbcL, psbA-trnH, trnL-F). Zhengyia shennongensis is readily distinguished from the related genera Urtica, Hesperocnide, and Laportea in the tribe Urticeae by its seed (oblong-globose or subglobose and not compressed achenes, surface densely covered with nipple-shaped protuberances) and stipule morphology (large leaf-like stipules with auriculate and amplexicaulous base and united with stem). Phylogenetic evidence indicates that Zhengyia is a distinct group related to Urtica (including Hesperocnide) species and Laportea cuspidata in tribe Urticeae. The bulbiliferous species of the tribe (L. bulbifera, L. cuspidata, Z. shennongensis) do not form a clade. This result indicates that the bulbil trait evolved in parallel within Urticeae. Our findings highlight the importance of shady and moist habitats in promoting species diversification and the parallel evolution of morphological traits that are likely to be adaptive.
24389316|Polycnemoideae is a poorly studied subfamily of the Amaranthaceae/Chenopodiaceae alliance which contains ca. 13 rare species in three disjunctly distributed genera. We present the results of a dated molecular phylogeny and a survey of morphology, micromorphology and stem anatomy revealing the phylogenetic relationships and historical biogeography of the subfamily as well as its morphological evolution. The results are converted into a new classification of the group. The divergence of Polycnemoideae from Amaranthaceae s.str. dates back to the Eocene and the oldest split in the subfamily separated a Northern Hemisphere lineage (Polycnemum) and a predominantly Southern Hemisphere lineage (Nitrophila, Hemichroa, Surreya gen. nov.) around the Eocene/Oligocene boundary. There is some evidence for a southern connection via Antarctica in the ancestor of the Nitrophila/Hemichroa/Surreya clade. The amphitropical genus Nitrophila likely originated in South America and reached North America via long-distance dispersal. Genera of Polycnemoideae diversified during the Miocene and Pliocene. They are species-poor and appear relictual. The morphological and micromorphological survey revealed a number of useful diagnostic characters which permit a clear definition of all four genera and 13 species recognized here. Hemichroa in its traditional circumscription lacks diagnostic characters. Hemichroa pentandra is much more similar to Nitrophila and shares a number of symplesiomorphies with it, while H. diandra and H. mesembryanthema, which form a highly supported clade, show several clear synapomorphic characters. Therefore the latter two species are here described within a new genus, Surreya R. Masson & G. Kadereit.
24389317|New data on fruit anatomy, floral characters and pollen morphology are reported for three species of Pterocephalus s.l. in its traditional circumscription: the annual W-Mediterranean Pterocephalus diandrus (now Pterocephalidium diandrum), the shrubby SE African P. centennii, and the E African P. frutescens. For comparison and augmentation of taxonomically relevant data, a few selected taxa of Cephalaria, Dipsacus, Knautia, Succisa, and Succisella were also studied. Important apomorphic differences between P. diandrus, P. centennii and the African P. frutescens as a typical representative of Pterocephalus s.str., support generic status for P. diandrus (as Pterocephalidium diandrum) and also strongly suggest separation of P. centennii from Pterocephalus s.str. as the new monotypic genus Pterothamnus, endemic to Africa (Mozambique). Pterocephalidium and Pterothamnus share several features (presence of floral bracts, 4-merous flowers, epicalyx anatomy, peculiar pollen morphology) and are placed into the new tribe Pterocephalidieae, which is clearly separated from Pterocephalus s.str. Available morphological, anatomical and palynological data support recent DNA-analytical evidence that Pterocephalidieae are related to the former tribes Dipsaceae (including Dipsacus, Cephalaria and possibly Simenia) and Knautieae (only Knautia), plus the new tribes Succiseae (Succisa and Succisella) and Pseudoscabioseae (Pseudoscabiosa). These four tribes constitute the "Dipknautid clade" sensu Carlson & al. and are here united under subfamily Dipsacoideae. Phylogenetically, this is sister to but quite distinct from subfamily Scabiosoideae, which includes the tribes Scabioseae s.str. (Scabiosa s.str., Sixalix, Pterocephalus s.str.) and the new Lomelosieae (Lomelosia, Pycnocomon). The position of the relic E Asian genus Bassecoia (incl. Pterocephalodes) is uncertain. Whereas DNA evidence places it at the base of Dipsacaceae and sister to the rest of the family, morphological characters strongly demonstrate closer affinities to Pseudoscabioseae. As a compromise, Bassecoia is made a separate tribe Bassecoieae, sister to Pseudoscabioseae within Dipsacoideae. This improved classification of Dipsacaceae shows unequivocally that multiplied and plumose calyx teeth, formerly considered exclusive for Pterocephalus, constitute a homoplastic and taxonomically misleading character that has evolved at least six times independently in Dipsacaceae.
24389318|Senecio sect. Crociseris is one of the three main sections of western Eurasian/northern African Senecio species. Previous studies indicated that species commonly assigned to this section are closely related to those of sect. Doria. The aim of the research presented here was to test the morphology-based delimitation of sect. Crociseris using phylogenetic analyses of plastid and nuclear DNA sequence data. The results of these studies are used to propose a new delimitation of sect. Crociseris. Species of sect. Doria were nested within a clade formed by species of sect. Crociseris. Section Doria is therefore best considered a synonym of sect. Crociseris. In addition, S. racemosus, traditionally included in sect. Crociseris, is transferred to the genus Jacobaea. One of the two J. kirghisica specimens that were sequenced contains ITS copies that are most closely related to those of sect. Crociseris as well as copies that nest among ITS accessions of Jacobaea. This suggests intergeneric hybridization between Senecio and Jacobaea.
24389319|Morphology and anatomy of a fossil nymphaealean plant, Jaguariba wiersemana gen. nov. et sp. nov. from the late Early Cretaceous of northeastern Brazil, and extant aquatic flowering plants are comparatively studied. Characteristic features indicate that Jaguariba gen. nov. is a member of Nymphaeaceae, and may belong to Nymphaeoideae. The occurrence of both Nymphaeaceae and Cabombaceae (e.g., Pluricarpellatia peltata) in the Lower Cretaceous contradicts recent molecular dating implying a Late CretaceousEarly Tertiary divergence for those families. Furthermore, the morphology of the fossil and sedimentologic and taphonomic data indicate that Jaguariba gen. nov. had an aquatic ecology similar to living Nymphaeaceae. Thus the taxon was part of the aquatic vegetation of the Crato lake in association with Pluricarpellatia peltata, an earlier described cabombaceaen aquatic angiosperm.
24389320|In 1912, C.B. Robinson published an analysis of the Hortus Bengalensis. This work by William Roxburgh consists of a listing of the plant species growing in the East India Company Botanic Garden in Calcutta, and the new species Roxburgh was intending to publish in his Flora Indica. No descriptions are included in the Hortus Bengalensis, but as Robinson pointed out, a minority of names included are validated by citation of descriptions published elsewhere. The current paper reviews these names, particularly in terms of their application and typification. The identity of Laurus nitida Roxb. is clarified, and Cinnamomum nitidum (Roxb.) Hook, is shown to be the correct name for C. burmanni (Nees & T. Nees) Blume. A proposal to reject the name Laurus nitida Roxb., in order to maintain the accepted nomenclature of this important spice plant has been submitted. A number of cases are highlighted where later application of names first validated in the Hortus Bengalensis conflicts with their typification. These include Bambusa baccifera Roxb. ( Melocanna baccifera (Roxb.) Kurz), Calamus latifolius Roxb., Arum gracile Roxb. and Morinda bracteata Roxb. Proposals to conserve Bambusa baccifera Roxb. and Calamus latifolius Roxb. with conserved types have been made in order to maintain the current application of these and other important bamboo and rattan names. Despite the work of Robinson, and subsequent analyses of Merrill and others, certain names validated by Roxburgh are still not always recognised as the correct ones, e.g. Holostemma annularium (Roxb.) K. Schum. for H. ada-kodien Schult., Bambusa spinosa Roxb. for B. blumeana Schult. f., Ficus racemifera Roxb. for F. nodosa Teijsm. & Binnend. A number of nomenclatural changes are required based on the current investigation: Typhonium harpung Srib., J. Murata, K. Iwats. & I.M. Turner, replaces T. gracile (Roxb.) Schott excluding its nomenclatural type; Aganosma heynei (Spreng.) I.M. Turner, comb. nov., replaces A. dichotoma K. Schum., Hibiscus tortuosus Roxb. ( Talipariti tortuosum (Roxb.) Fryxell) is a synonym of Talipariti tiliaceum (L.) Fryxell, Diospyros nigra (J.F. Gmel.) Perr. is the correct name for D. digyna Jacq., the Nicobar breadfruit is correctly Pandanus leram Jones ex R. Millar, Sesbania aculeata (Schreb.) Pers. is the correct name for Sesbania bispinosa (Jacq.) Spreng. ex Steud., Asclepias senecionifolia M.E. Jones is the correct name for A. rosea Kunth and Salvia cana Wall. ex Benth. is correct for what has been called S. lanata Roxb. or S. mukerjeei Bennet & Raizada. Lectotypes are designated for 46 names and neotypes are designated for two names. Epitypes are designated for three names in which the identity of the lectotype is demonstrably ambiguous.

taxon.62.2.217|The Leguminosae, the third-largest angiosperm family, has a global distribution and high ecological and economic importance. We examine how the legume systematic research community might join forces to produce a comprehensive phylogenetic estimate for the ca. 751 genera and ca. 19,500 species of legumes and then translate it into a phylogeny-based classification. We review the current state of knowledge of legume phylogeny and highlight where problems lie, for example in taxon sampling and phylogenetic resolution. We review approaches from bioinformatics and next-generation sequencing, which can facilitate the production of better phylogenetic estimates. Finally, we examine how morphology can be incorporated into legume phylogeny to address issues in comparative biology and classification. Our goal is to stimulate the research needed to improve our knowledge of legume phylogeny and evolution; the approaches that we discuss may also be relevant to other species-rich angiosperm clades.
taxon.62.2.249|While many plant species are considered threatened under anthropogenic pressure, it remains uncertain how rapidly we are losing plant species diversity. To fill this gap, we propose a Global Legume Diversity Assessment (GLDA) as the first step of a global plant diversity assessment. Here we describe the concept of GLDA and its feasibility by reviewing relevant approaches and data availability. We conclude that Fabaceae is a good proxy for overall angiosperm diversity in many habitats and that much relevant data for GLDA are available. As indicators of states, we propose comparison of species richness with phylogenetic and functional diversity to obtain an integrated picture of diversity. As indicators of trends, species loss rate and extinction risks should be assessed. Specimen records and plot data provide key resources for assessing legume diversity at a global scale, and distribution modeling based on these records provide key methods for assessing states and trends of legume diversity. GLDA has started in Asia, and we call for a truly global legume diversity assessment by wider geographic collaborations among various scientists.

taxon.62.5.876|Over the past 50 years, many different quantitative approaches have been developed to infer systematic relationships, and these have led to three distinct schools of systematics: phenetics, cladistics, and quantitative evolutionary systematics (= explicit phyletics). Phenetics emphasized quantitative assessment of overall similarity and taught the distinction between character and character state. Cladistics stressed reconstruction of phylogeny by use of synapomorphies and emphasized holophyly in classification. Quantitative evolutionary systematics built upon cladistic analysis and stressed incorporation of quantitative measures of divergence within lineages. In parallel with these conceptual and algorithmic developments have come technological advances that have allowed deep access to genetic data, beginning with allozymes, then DNA restriction site data, nuclear and organellar DNA sequences and fragment patterns, and now large-scale genomics. The challenge in recent years has not been for new philosophical reflections on how best to interpret evolutionary history, but rather on methods to make sense of the torrents of new genetic data that apply at all levels of the taxonomic hierarchy. The search for patterns in these new data has led to use of whatever methods seem best suited for the job at hand. Phylogenetic reconstructions are now routinely done with formerly phenetic algorithms, and cladistic methods are sometimes used at the populational level. More sophisticated approaches have also been developed, such as likelihood and Bayesian statistics, and these are applicable at many different hierarchical levels. Awareness of lateral gene transfer, pervasive polyploidy, and ancient hybridizations, has led to new methods to allow better understanding of complex reticulate relationships. It is no longer productive, therefore, to worry about ideological aspects of schools of systematics but rather to focus on which algorithms and statistics are best suited to answer specific questions. For formal classification, however, areas of conflict still remain. The challenge is to determine which combination of quantitative methods will result in the most information-rich and predictive hierarchical system, realizing that special-purpose classifications will continue to be used in certain instances.
taxon.62.5.886|Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized molecular systematics as well as population and conservation genetics. It is now possible to obtain enormous amounts of gene sequence data from any species in a short time at low cost. More technological advances are on the horizon, ensuring that this trend will continue throughout the coming decade. These rapid advances provide unprecedented opportunities in systematics; they also pose new challenges, requiring that the next generation of systematists be well-versed in new skill sets (e.g., bioinformatics). As examples of the potential of NGS, it is now possible to develop genetic resources for any plant system that poses intriguing evolutionary questions. During the next decade many new evolutionary model systems will become available as systematists rapidly develop the necessary genetic/genomic frameworks for many previously unstudied plants. Phylogenetic reconstruction will be conducted at an unprecedented pace at both deep and fine scales with datasets of numerous taxa and genesthis includes rapid progress on assembling a more comprehensive Tree of Life for green plants. For example, complete plastid genome sequencing is now routinely facilitating analyses of hundreds of taxa at deep levels, as well as enabling complete plastid genome phylogeographic analyses at the population level. Gene capture methods hold enormous promise for the rapid and inexpensive analyses of complete plastid genomes, as well as studies of hundreds of selected (targeted) nuclear loci. NGS has also had a big impact on population genetics, initially by dramatically simplifying microsatellite marker development, but more recently by opening new possibilities through various genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approaches that have great potential to expand on the types of questions that can be addressed at the population level. Transcriptome sequencing has enabled the construction of large datasets of nuclear genes while also providing a wealth of plastid and mitochondrial genes. NGS has also facilitated probe development for studies of chromosomes using FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization). NGS is also making the rapid sequencing of complete nuclear genomes routine, thus transforming our field and opening up new avenues of systematic endeavor in comparative genomics. However, even as sequencing costs drop and technological advances make complete nuclear genome sequencing more commonplace, genome assembly will remain a major challenge.
taxon.62.5.899|While phylogenetic systematics has developed rapidly and impressively over the last five decades, a reawakened interest in the role and impact of biodiversity collections epitomizes the last two decades in particular. In this essay, we explore various aspects that characterize this Biodiversity Information Synthesis: achievements, impediments, shifting personnel roles, technological advancements, and predictions on future trendsboth bleak and promising.
taxon.62.5.912|Biogeography is a multidisciplinary science concerned with how and why organisms are distributed as they are on Earth. It links fields such as systematics, ecology, paleontology, and climatology, and occupies a central position in evolutionary biology, being fundamental to the study of processes such as speciation and adaptive radiation. Here we provide a brief overview of some particularly dynamic areas of inquiry and offer some perspectives on future directions for the field. We hope that some historical debates, such as those over the importance of dispersal, or the validity of molecular dating, are finally being put to rest. Over the last decade, biogeography has become increasingly integrative, and has benefited from advances in statistical methods for inferring geographic range dynamics in a phylogenetic context, molecular estimation of lineage divergence times, and modeling lineage birth and death. These are enabling greater insights into patterns of organismal diversification in time and space. In the next decade, analytical challenges are emerging on several fronts. For example, phylogenies are increasing in size and taxonomic breadth and new sequencing technologies enabling phylogenetic and phylogeographic datasets are increasingly genomic in depth. In addition, geographic occurrence data are accumulating in online repositories, yet tools for data mining and synthetic analysis are lacking for comparative multi-lineage studies. Biogeography is thus entering an era characterized by phylogenomic datasets, increasingly comprehensive sampling of clades, and interdisciplinary synthesis. We anticipate continued progress in our understanding of biodiversity patterns at regional and global scales, but this will likely require greater collaboration with specialists in bioinformatics and computational science. Finally, it is clear that biogeography has an increasingly important role to play in the discovery and conservation of biodiversity. Lessons learned from biogeographic studies of islands are being applied to better understand extinction dynamics as continental ecosystems become more fragmented, and phylogeography and ecological niche modeling offer innovative paths toward the discovery of previously unknown species distributions and priority areas for conservation. The future of biogeography is bright and filled with exciting challenges and opportunities.

taxon.62.6.1248|Biological specimens in research collections provide the most important baseline information for systematic research. Traditionally, they are annotated by experts in written form, which remains directly associated with the specimens. These annotations, defined as data added at a later stage to the original data, provide an important quality control mechanism. They improve the value of herbarium specimens and are identification trails documenting the development of taxonomic concepts over time. With specimen data increasingly becoming accessible via the Internet, a general online annotation system that ensures that the traditional data sharing and documentation of specimen data is continued after the information is mobilised through digitisation, is currently missing. We lay out the prerequisites for such an annotation system including data standards, a data repository, system access, and user roles. We also introduce an exemplar solution developed in the DFG-funded Anno-Sys project. AnnoSys is being implemented using the example of collection and observation data in the botanical domain as provided by the GBIF/BioCASe networks. It provides a user-friendly interface to allow researchers to produce and discover annotations. If a record has been annotated, both the annotation and the original record will be stored in a repository, linked via a persistent identifier, and will be accessible through the AnnoSys interfaces. Collection holders and scientists specifically interested in a subset of data will be informed about annotations in which they have expressed interest. We discuss AnnoSys in relation to the FilteredPush project, which pursues the same goal in facilitating and communicating online annotations, but which takes a different approach.
taxon.62.6.1259|Application of conventional (plant pressing followed by air drying) and Schweinfurth drying techniques to different plant taxa is shown to result in both significant contraction and, occasionally, significant expansion of plant organs. The results are taxon dependent. The Schweinfurth drying process usually results in greater shrinkage than conventional drying. Herbarium specimens are shown to exhibit significant differences in the dimensions of plant organs as compared to fresh material. Organ accessibility and availability can also have an impact on the dimensions recorded and, as with the drying process, an impact on the correct recognition of taxa. The lack of discussion of these important differences, their impact on other taxonomic processes and suggestions for further investigation, for example the use of spirit preserved material and rehydration of herbarium material, are highlighted.
