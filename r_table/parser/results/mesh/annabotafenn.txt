23726634|Schistidium halinae Ochyra (Grimmiaceae, Bryopsida) is described as a new species based on ten collections from the maritime West Antarctic. It differs from the congeners in (1) its piliferous upper leaves giving the plants a hoary appearance, (2) sharply spinulose-denticulate, hyaline, broad, flattened and membraneous hair-points, 0.2 1.0 mm long on the upper leaves, (3) narrowly recurved and partially bistratose margins in the upper half leaf, (4) presence of a large central strand, (5) short-rectangular and sinuose laminal cells in the lower middle, and (6) long-rectangular basal juxtacostal cells with straight incrassate walls and quadrate to short-rectangular basal marginal cells forming a band 46 cells wide. Additionally, the capsules are deeply immersed in the ovate perichaetial leaves with a plane or narrowly recurved margin on one side below the apex and terminated with a long, hyaline hair-point (0.61.4 mm). The exothecial cells are mostly isodiametric to oblong, thin-walled with distinct corner thickenings and the peristome teeth are erect, lanceolate, perforate to irregularly cracked. The new species is fully described and illustrated and its affinities are discussed. Schistidium halinae is currently known from King George and Livingston Islands in the South Shetland Islands and from Vega and James Ross Islands near Trinity Peninsula on the NE coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. The distribution is mapped.
23727774|Tacca ampliplacenta L. Zhang & Q.-J. Li sp. nova (Taccaceae) is described and illustrated from Yunnan province, China. It is distinguished by the following characters: the petioles, peduncles, and flowers are red wine-coloured instead of dark purple; the bracts are very similar to T. chantrieri, but the fruits have different intumescent placentas, which fill the fruit cavity; and the stalk of the infructescence is rich in flexible fibre and very tough. Its flowering period (JulyAugust) is rather late as compared with that of the sympatric T. chantrieri (AprilJune). This phenological difference may play an important role in reproductive isolation between the two species.
23727733|Viola nanlingensis J.S. Zhou & F.W. Xing sp. nova (Violaceae), a new species from Guangdong province in southern China is described and illustrated. It is compared with the morphologically similar species V. nagasawai and V. diffusa.
23726834|Charcoal particle and pollen influx values in the annually laminated sediment of a boreal forest lake surrounded mostly by mesic soils were used to reconstruct the history of forest fires in Eastern Finland for a 600-year period between 100 BC and AD 500, prior to any significant human influence. Six to seven local fires were detected during this period, at an average interval of 90115 years. The corresponding fire rotation time is estimated to be 180230 years. The local fire interval and Picea pollen percentages at the site were of the same magnitude as those recorded at two sites with dry soils in eastern Finland, suggesting that the average fire return interval may have been similar at dry and mesic sites. The intensity of fires was estimated from the declines in influxes of spruce and pine pollen. Pine can survive surficial fires of low intensity, but spruce trees are killed by virtually all fires. The contemporary declines in spruce and pine pollen influxes suggest that about half of the fires were strong ones, causing stand replacement.
23727767|Dynamics of mycorrhizal colonization of two orchid species, rhizomatous Cephalanthera longifolia and tuberous Dactylorhiza majalis, was studied during two growing seasons, with special emphasis on the occurrence of collapsed pelotons. No complete lysis of pelotons in digestion cells was found. Mycorrhizal colonization of subterranean organs of both species was observed to take place even before aerial shoots developed, indicating that colonization is not restricted to leafy season, and was constantly present throughout the growing seasons with no distinct coincidence with flowering or fruiting time. Mycorrhizal colonization of C. longifolia was patchy and of low degree (mean = 4.4%, SE = 0.3%). It occurred mostly in the distal parts of main roots, lateral roots and/or in isolated root parts. Intensity of mycorrhizal colonization of D. majalis was generally higher (mean = 12.1%, SE = 0.7%). Tubers lacked colonization except in the root-like extensions.
23726550|The semi-natural grasslands were inventoried in the province of South Karelia (Finland) in 1992, 1993 and 1996. Altogether 89 different sites were found, covering a total area of 97 hectares. The sites were classified into five different biotopes, which comprised a total of 115 grasslands. Three-quarters of all sites (68, 76%), covering an area of 65 hectares (67% of total), were assessed as being in danger of losing their value because of either poor management or lack of management. The results indicate that the area of semi-natural grasslands in the province is now about 250 times smaller (0.4%) than at the beginning of the 20th century. The status of these environments in South Karelia is alarming.
23728240|Helianthemum motae Snchez-Gmez, J.F. Jimnez & J.B. Vera (Cistaceae) is described as a new species from southeastern Spain. It belongs to the section Lavandulaceum and appears to be close to H. syriacum. The diagnostic characters, a phylogenetic study as well as a full description, a dichotomic key, and illustrations are provided. Both macromorphological and micromorphological characters are discussed and compared with the morphologically related species. The conservational status of H. motae is discussed.
23725452|Splachnum turbinatum Brid. is conspecific with Haplodontium megalocarpum (Arnott) Jaeg., and Tayloria henryae Dix. with Funaria hygrometrica Hedw.
23726433|Six new species are described, which were collected in Albania in 1983 and later cultivated in Finland. Four of them, T. aestuans Sonck, spec. nova, T. botanicorum Sonck, spec. nova, T. pseudogracilens Sonck, spec. nova and T. respersum Sonck, spec. nova, belong to sect. Erythrosperma, and the remaining two, T. meyeri Sonck, spec. nova and T. shqipericum Sonck, spec. nova, to sect. Vulgaria sensu Dahlst. T. interveniens Hagl., also belonging to Vulgaria, is reported as new for Albania.
23726595|Thalli of the lichens Parmotrema austrosinense (Zahlbr.) Hale and P. conferendum Hale were taken from a non-polluted area and transplanted within this area, and to a downtown site in Crdoba, Argentina. Pigments, malondialdehyde, hydroperoxy-conjugated dienes and sulphur were measured after various exposure periods. Changes in the quantified compound concentrations were observed throughout the exposure period in both species and in both sites. In the urban site, however, chlorophyll concentration was lower and, in P. conferendum, malondialdehyde concentration was significatively higher. These results can be attributed to the effect of atmospheric pollutants on the transplanted lichens.
23725208|The occurrence of 50 woody plant species of the temperate zone was studied at 10 fixed localities along an almost 1000-km-long section of the Lower Amur Basin from the southwest to the northeast. The northern limits of distribution of these nemoral species were found to form four distinct concentrations, which corresponded to boundaries of the bioclimatic vegetation zones suggested for East Asia by L. Hmet-Ahti and her coworkers in earlier Finnish investigations. The present work gives a detailed description of these boundary areas and a proposal for the delimitation of the northern temperate, hemiboreal, and southern boreal subzones in the Lower Amur Basin. To a great extent, the boundaries of the vegetation zones seem to coincide with mountain ranges surrounding the river basin. The present study suggests that more attention should be directed to preserving the now endangered northernmost nemoral associations. For conservation purposes two new nature parks of the zapovednik category are needed.
23724202|The germination rate of wheat powdery mildew (Erysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici) conidia was examined by means of an apparatus which permitted continuous observation of the germination of each sample throughout the experiment. Germination experiments were conducted at constant RH and at temperatures ranging from +5 to +30 with intervals of 2.5. Germination was fastest at +20 and +22.5 C. The highest germination percentage was obtained at +17.5 C.
23727853|Anoectochilus malipoensis W.H. Chen & Y.M. Shui sp. nova (Orchidaceae) from Yunnan, China, is described and illustrated. It is similar to A. emeiensis but differs by having a narrow membranaceous rim in the anther cap, obovate epichile lobes with acuminate apex and crenulate margins, a narrow rim inside hypochile lobes, two 11.2 mm long cornua on the end of the spur, and broadly cupulate calli in the spur. These differences in flower morphology were observed in the holotype specimens. We also revise some characteristics of A. emeiensis based on examination of its holotype. The relationship between A. malipoensis and A. papillosus is discussed. Furthermore, a new identification key to the fourteen species of Anoectochilus (excluding Odontochilus) from China and Vietnam is given here.
23726427|Colonization by diatoms of ceramic and glass panels was studied for 8 weeks in early summer in the hydrolittoral (0.3 m) and sublittoral (2.5 and 5 m) of a brackish-water archipelago at Tvrminne in the northern Baltic Sea. The structure of the diatom community was described with several diversity and evenness indices, species abundance distributions, ranked-abundance and k-dominance curves, and multivariate ordination methods. Altogether 99 diatom species occurred on the panels, while the maximum number of species on a panel at any time was 46. In spite of major differences in abundance, the development of the diatom community at all three depths and on the two substrata showed a similar pattern, passing from the strong dominance of a single species towards the more even distribution of more numerous species. In the sublittoral, there were no consistent differences between the substrata, but in the hydrolittoral the diatom community on glass had higher dominance early in the study period. The diversity ordering of the diatom associations at the end of the study period showed the lowest diversity and highest dominance in the hydrolittoral. The simplest and most efficient description of changes in the structure of the diatom community was obtained with the number of species observed in samples of standardized size together with ranked-abundance or k-dominance curves. The spatial and temporal patterns of diatom colonization were successfully described by principal coordinates analysis with Williamson's modification for calculating distances and correspondence analysis.
23727900|Liparis cheniana X.H. Jin sp. nova (Orchidaceae), is described and illustrated from southwestern Xizang (Tibet), China. It is restricted to the alpine region of the Gaoligongshan Mountains at an elevation of about 3700 m. Liparis cheniana is similar to L. rostrata in having two calli at the base of the column, but differs from it by having a lanceolate and acuminate lip with a ridge ranging from the base to the tip.
23727168|The field garlic Allium oleraceum is reproducing by subterraneous bulbs, and above ground by bulbils and seed. Two chromosome numbers, tetraploid (2n = 32) and pentaploid (2n = 40) have been found in Finland and Sweden. The seed production was studied in some population of A. oleraceum mainly in south Finland. The fruits mature only if visited by insects and the seed ripen only in favourable, that is warm and not too dry, summers. Several insect species of the orders Hymenoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera were found to visit flowers of Allium oleraceum. The most frequent visitors were Bombus lapidarius (Apidae), Dolichovespula norwegica and D. saxonica (Vespidae), Eumenes spp. (Eumenidae), Volucella spp. and Syrphus spp. (Syrphidae), Pieris napi (Pieridae) and Autographa gamma (Noctuidae). Wasps of the family Vespidae are very regular visitors in the flowers of Allium oleraceum. Thus we suggest that Allium oleraceum is a species which has "wasp blossoms". Both tetraploid and pentaploid plants are visited by insects and they both produce viable seed. The seed is described. In germination tests most of the seeds of both ploidy levels germinated well.
23726720|Agaricus nebularis Batsch : Fr. is approved as the lectotype of the genus Clitocybe (Fr.) Staude (Agaricales: Tricholomataceae). Lepista (Fr.) W.G. Smith is a younger taxonomic synonym. Diagnostic characters of Clitocybe are discussed; among the less known ones are: (i) a proportion of the detached spores adhere in tetrads in microscopic mounts, (ii) the spore wall is cyanophilic, and (iii) the mycelium is capable of reducing nitrate. Three new nomenclatural combinations in Clitocybe are made. The new genus Infundibulicybe Harmaja, with Agaricus gibbus Pers. : Fr. as the type, is segregated for the core group of those species of Clitocybe s. lato that do not fit to the genus as defined here. Infundibulicybe mainly differs from Clitocybe in that: (i) the spores do not adhere in tetrads, (ii) all or a proportion of the spores have confluent bases, (iii) all or most of the spores are lacrymoid in shape, (iv) the spore wall is cyanophobic, and (v) the mycelium is incapable of reducing nitrate. Thirteen new nomenclatural combinations in Infundibulicybe are made. Two new nomenclatural combinations are made in Ampulloclitocybe Redhead, Lutzoni, Moncalvo & Vilgalys (syn. Clavicybe Harmaja), a recent segregate of Clitocybe.
43922325|The study includes the following accepted species: Cladortia ciliata Stirt., C. portentosa (Duf.) Zahlbr., C. uncialis (L.) Wigg., C. metacorallifera Asah., C. sulpharina (Michx.)

(nom. illeg., but no correct name proposed). C. maxima and C. metacorallifera var. reagens Asah. are reported, as new to Europe, while C. elongata (Jacq.) Hoffm. is excluded from the European flora. New reports on chemistry: C. portentosa subsp. pacifica f, decolorans (perlatolic acid constant, ursolic acid as accessory; no usnic acid), C. stricta var. uliginosa (fumarprotocetraric acid, atranorin), C. maxima (fumarprotocetraric acid constant, atranorin accessory) and C. macroceras (fumarprotocetraric acid).
23725752|The relationshops of fire history to forest type and topography were examined on 75 sample plots in Muddus National Park (50 000 ha; northern Sweden). A correlation matrix was constructed for 13 variables. During the last 600 years, most fires appear to have occurred on steep slopes, on continuous uplands and at low altitudes. These areas are at present dominated by Pinus sylvestris, dwarf-shrubs (e.g. Empetrum hermaphroditum) and lichens (e.g. Cladonia spp.). Mires have functioned as fire-breaks, resulting in Picea abies forests (with Vaccinium myrtillus and Gymnocarpium dryopteris) in which traces of fire are absent or extremely rare. Fire frequency was not correlated to aspect. Repeated surface fires seem to have promoted the longevity of Pinus sylvestris (>700 years old), and to have maintained the lichen-dominated forest type.
23727715|Rhododendron yunyianum X.F. Jin & B.Y. Ding (Ericaceae), sp. nova of subgen. Tsutsusi is described and illustrated from Fujian, China. It is morphologically similar to R. taipaoense and R. simsii, but differs from them mainly in having young shoots with both setose and strigose hairs, conspicuous calyx lobes, narrowly funnelform corollas, and 710 stamens.
23725305|Eight new species belonging to Taraxacum sect. Erythrosperma Lindb. fil. are described: T. acutiusculum Sonck, T. divinum Sonck, T. fibratum Sonck, T. fragosum Sonck, T. herae Sonck, T. lingulilobum Sonck, T. olympicola Sonck and T. terenodes Sonck, and one, T. dialeptum Sonck, which belongs to sect. Erythrocarpa H.-M.
23726290|The purpose was to determine the extent to which the relatively sparse lichen flora on the trunks of Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris L.) can serve as an indicator of air purity. The percentage cover and condition of the lichens were recorded in sample plots from which lichens (Hypogymnia physodes) and pine needles were collected for chemical analysis. Clear differences in pollution tolerance were found between the species, Platismatia glauca and H. tubulosa being the most sensitive of the macrolichens and H. physodes and Parmeliopsis ambigua the most tolerant. With decreasing distance from the city centre the numbers of macrolichen species and their size and percentage cover diminished, changes in their external appearance became more marked and the concentrations of impurities in the lichens and pine needles increased. Pendulous lichens of the genus Bryoria occurred on fairly polluted plots, but their maximum lengths remained small. No actual 'lichen desert' could be discerned, however. The interaction of air pollutants with other environmental factors is discussed.
23727161|The structure of the bryophyte communities of herb-rich forests has been studied relatively little in northern Europe. In this study, the bryophyte flora of herb-rich forests in eastern Finland was analysed and classified. Altogether 101 sample plots were studied. The species and sample plots were classified with TWINSPAN and ordinated with Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) by using (1) bryophytes (n = 100), (2) vascular plants and bryophytes (n = 265) and (3) vascular plants (n = 165). The results indicated that bryophytes reflected different environmental factors than vascular plants. When classification was based on bryophytes, TWINSPAN clusters corresponded better to topography and stand structure than to 'a priori' site types. When classification was based on vascular plants and bryophytes or on vascular plants, TWINSPAN clusters corresponded quite well to 'a priori' site types. In all classifications, paludified herb-rich forests formed an own group, which might present a transition type between moist fern-rich forests and eutrophic paludified spruce forests. Bryophytes seemed to play a minor role in the classification of herb-rich forests. However, bryophytes improved the classification providing additional information of the site. The most accurate classification was obtained when both vascular plants and bryophytes were used to distinguish different vegetation types simultaneously.
23726635|Phylogenetic analyses were carried out on 23 samples representing 10 cetrarioid taxa from Europe and North America, representing 10 cetrarioid taxa; they were compared in parsimony analyses. The study is focused on ITS sequences of the ribosomal DNA. Intervening sequences, most likely representing group I introns, were found in four taxa. The results from the phylogenetic analysis are congruent with species delimitations derived from morphological characters, regardless of the geographic origin of the material. ITS and group I intron sequences from populations within the same species usually differ at very few base positions. The inclusion of Cetraria aculeata (Schreb.) Fr. in Cetraria Ach. and the exclusion of Melanelia hepatizon (Ach.) A. Thell, Tuckermannopsis chlorophylla (Willd.) Hale, and the genera Cetrelia W. L. Culb. & C. F. Culb., Flavocetraria Krnefelt & A. Thell, and Platismatia W. L. Culb. & C. F. Culb. from Cetraria is supported by the analyses, if the genus Vulpicida J.-E. Mattsson and M. J. Lai is maintained in this grouping.
23725224|The planktonic/littoral diatom ratios from a shallow prairie lake and a deep lake in the coniferous-deciduous forest region of Minnesota, U.S.A., were compared with the mean and maximum depths and the Secchi disc transparencies. The results indicate that the ratios of P/L and the mean and maximum depths and transparency, correspondingly, may be significantly higher for a shallow lake than for a deep lake.
23725238|The length growth rates, production and biomass of two reindeer lichens, Cladonia arbuscula (Wallr.) Rabenh., and Cladonia rangiferina (L.) Wigg., were measured in the raised bog Laaviosuo, Lammi, southern Finland. The cover, biomass and production of C. rangiferina were higher than those of C. arbuscula in all the habitats studied (high hummocks, low hummocks, upper hollows). When the proportions of all the different habitats were considered in the calculations, the combined biomass of the two lichens in Laaviosuo was estimated at 19.1 g m-2 and their total mean annual production at 2.8 g m-2. When the hollows were excluded from the calculations the corresponding values were 23.1 g m-2 and 3.4 g m-2. The linear growth rate (measured by dividing the length of the living podetium by the number of internodes in it) was 5.9  0.1 mm a year (x  S.E.) for C. rangiferina, with a total variation of 3.9-7.7 mm. For C. arbuscula the corresponding values were 6.0  0.1 mm a year and 4.6-7.5 mm. These values are of the same magnitude or possibly a little higher than those obtained in earlier studies.
23724638|The ecology, especially the macro-ecology, of rust fungi, and the distribution of the species was studied in Lammi commune; the species numbered 108. The distance between the hosts of some rusts was studied. The phenology of the rusts shows a relation to the macroclimate at the community level and to the microclimate at the species level. Factors affecting the phenology are discussed; every species has its own phenological code. Occurrence in different habitats was studied. Man has clearly influenced the distribution by his agricultural and silvicultural activities. Some rust species are most abundant on roadsides, others in shady places. The rusts are classified in relation to the influence of man. The factors affecting the occurrence of rusts in some manmade habitats are discussed. The macro-ecology of the rust fungi is outlined and their ecological amplitudes are discussed.
23726802|In this paper five Hieracium s. lato species are shifted into Pilosella and one subspecies is raised to species level in Hieracium s. stricto. These new combinations bring the number of Hieracium and Pilosella species in Turkey to 113 and 42, respectively.
23727658|A new moss species, Orthomnion wui T.J. Kop. (Mniaceae) is described. It differs from its morphologically nearest relative O. yunnanense T.J. Kop., X.J. Li & M. Zang in being synoicous and lacking decurrent leaf bases, and from most of the other congeners by its stereidal cells in costa and serrate leaf margin. It is known only from the type specimens collected in the Hubei Province of China.
23727998|Two new species of Dichoropetalum (Apiaceae) are described and illustrated from Turkey. Dichoropetalum anatolicum Pimenov & Kljuykov sp. nova grows on stony slopes and cliffs in Elmali Da (C2 Antalya province) and Honaz Da (C2 Denizli province), and is related to D. platycarpum and D. scoparium. Dichoropetalum bupleuroides Pimenov & Kljuykov sp. nova is distributed in the Hakkari province (Cilo Da). A new combination, D. longibracteolatum (Parolly & Nordt) Pimenov & Kljuykov is proposed for a recently described species, Peucedanum longibracteolatum from the Taurus Mountains in the Antalya and Iel provinces. After this contribution Dichoropetalum contains a total of 29 species, 14 of which occur in Turkey.
23727730|Anoectochilus hainanensis H.Z. Tian, F.W. Xing & L. Li sp. nova (Orchidaceae) is described from Hainan, China, and illustrated. It can be distinguished from the morphologically similar A. reinwardtii by the leaves, which have much denser and exquisitely golden-shiny reticulations on the upper surface, and by the column wings which have a broadly ligulate anterior part and appressed inner margins, and a saddle-like lamelliform posterior part connected with the anterior part at an acute angle.
23727258|The original herbarium vouchers for six species of Rosa (Rosaceae) described by S. G. Dimitrov from Bulgaria are taxonomically evaluated. Two species (R. balcanica, R. orphei) are considered hybrids, four other names (R. bulgarica, R. parilica, R. pontica and R. rhodopaea) are taxonomic synonyms of widespread taxa.
23728078|Lectotypes for Lonicera periclymenum L., L. pyrenaica L. and L. xylosteum L. are designated from original material conserved in BM (Clifford Herbarium), LINN (Linnaean Herbarium) and UPS-BURSER (Joachim Burser Herbarium).
23727242|Carex pallidula Harmaja, nom. nov., must replace C. pallens (Fristedt) Harmaja 1986, which is an illegitimate name as a younger homonym of C. pallens Z.P. Wang 1962.
23725475|The aquatic vegetation in the water area of representative waterfowl wetland, Koijrvi (6058'N, 2344'E), was mapped with the aid of aerial photographs in 1979, 1982, 1984 and 1986, in order to study the response of the vegetation to the changed water level (about 1015 cm lower than in the late 1970s). In the shallow homogeneous lake basin with soft mud bottoms, the aquatic vegetation is abundant, but the species number low. The largest plant community is floating-leaved vegetation dominated by Potamogeton natans, Nuphar lutea and Sparganium emersum, with a considerable admixture of submerged plants (Potamogeton obtusifolius, Utricularia vulgaris, Sparganium minimum). Equisetum fluviatile also forms large dense stands. The vegetation maps revealed clear expansion of helophyte and floating-leaved vegetation. The area of the Equisetum stands had increased three-fold (from 1 to 2.7 hectares) in 7 years. Typha latifolia had also invaded shallow water locations. Short-term succession caused by muskrats (Ondatra zibethica) increased the plant diversity in the closed Equisetum stands. The swamp margins bordering the water area revealed many small local changes due to the action of ice, wind and muskrats. Spread of vegetation from the lakeward margins to the water area was usually limited, and successful only in places where the plants could become rooted in the bottom.
23726619|A new species, Drepanolejeunea longii Grolle & R.L. Zhu, is described and illustrated from Bhutan. It is similar to D. pulla (Mitt.) Grolle, but differs in its falcate leaves with serrate margins, absence of gynoecial innovations, and 2(-3) uniseriate cells of the underleaf lobe apex.
23726759|The vegetation of four grazed and five ungrazed shore grasslands was studied in seashore and in delta on the southwestern coast of Finland. Ordinations and classifications separated delta plots from seashore plots, which were further divided into reed stand plots, epilittoral plots and geo- and hydrolittoral plots. The partitions reflected flooding stress, moisture conditions, grazing and properties of parent material. Elevation explained the data best. The primary factor in producing the vegetation zonation pattern in these Baltic coastal grasslands is the short-term fluctuation in sea-level. Although grazing was not the most important factor for explaining the variability in the data, its impact on the vegetation was considerable. Phragmites australis was much more common in ungrazed than in grazed plots. It dominated the hydrolittoral, was abundant in geolittoral and existed even in transition zone of the ungrazed transects. In grazed transects Agrostis stolonifera and Eleocharis uniglumis dominated the hydrolittoral. The lower geolittoral was dominated by perennial graminoids. In the middle and upper geolittoral, forbs were more frequent and abundant. In the grazed seashore transects, the lower geolittoral was dominated by Juncus gerardii, while in the ungrazed transects Calamagrostis stricta, Agrostis stolonifera and Juncus gerardii formed the zone together with Phragmites australis. The transition zone in the grazed transects was a narrow drift wall, in the ungrazed transects, however, it was much broader and dominated by tall growing plants. On fine-grained substrate, the epilittoral was dominated by Agrostis capillaris, Carex nigra and Deschampsia cespitosa and on till by Deschampsia flexuosa and Galium verum.
23726436|Hymenodon reggaeus Kartt. & S. Bck is described as new, and distinguished from the southern Brazilian H. aeruginosus (Hook. f. & Wils.) C. Mll. It occurs in Jamaica, Cuba, and in the Dominican Republic. H. sericeus (Dozy & Molk.) C. Mll. and H. tenellus Broth. & Par. are reduced to subspecies of H. pilifer Hook. f. & Wils. Other species of Hymenodon are also evaluated, and the genus is divided into two sections: sect. Hymenodon and sect. Polystichella.
23726967|Six new taxa are described and illustrated from Turkey as new to science: Arenaria yunus-emrei Ayta & H. Duman, A. mcneillii Ayta & H. Duman, Minuartia dianthifolia (Boiss.) Hand.-Mazz. subsp. elmalia Ayta, Dianthus crinitus Sm. var. argaeus Ayta & H. Duman, Bolanthus mevlanaea Ayta, and Silene caramanica Boiss. & Heldr. var. ilarslani Ayta & Dural. Their taxonomic positions are discussed and they are compared with the closely related taxa.
