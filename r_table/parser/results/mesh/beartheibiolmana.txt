10.2307/3872612|The official records of forestry and hunting organizations were examined for data pertaining to the legal and illegal harvest of brown bears (Ursus arctos) during 1946-85 in Gorski Kotar, Yugoslavia. During the 40-year period, 281 brown bears (191 males, 57 females, and 33 of unknown sex) were killed in Gorski Kotar. Total annual mortality ranged from 0 to 20. Bear mortalities consisted of 205 (73%) by hunting, 26 (9%) by poisoning, 31 (11%) by traffic (trains and motor vehicles), and 19 (7%) by unknown causes. Legal hunting accounted for 169 (60%) of all losses, illegal shooting took 36 (13%), and deaths from other causes totalled 76 (27%). The estimated ages of bears killed were 25 bears <1 year (9%), 105 bears 1-4 years (37%), and 151 bears >4 years of age (54%). Of bears killed, 105 (37%) weighed <100 kg, 80 (29%) weighed 100-150 kg, and 96 (34%) weighed > 150 kg. Legal hunting, accomplished by shooting from elevated stands over baits, tended to select adult males. About one-half of the illegally shot bears were taken in the same fashion and those also favored adult males. The most successful hunting occurred in spring (Mar-May) when 142 (69%) of 205 legally and illegally harvested bears were taken. The greater spring hunting success compared to other seasons was attributed to a number of factors including greater bear use of baiting sites because of the lack of natural foods and increased hunting effort because of pelt primeness.
10.2307/3872918| Production of foods has been linked to population sizes, social organization and mating strategies of many vertebrates, yet few studies of bears have quantified food production. In the Southern Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina, we quantified production of 2 important foods for black bears (Ursus americanus) during 1986-1988 and the U.S Forest Service quantified a third between 1962 and 1973. Annual production of squaw root (Conopholis americana) averaged 4.14 kg/ha whereas annual production of berries (Vaccinium spp., Gaylussacia spp., Rubus spp.) averaged 52 kg/ha in areas with berry bush cover, which translates to 2.6 kg/ha over the whole forest (including areas without berry cover). Mean gross energy production by squaw root was 4.97  10
