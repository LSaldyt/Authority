10.2307/3668341|Descriptions or diagnoses are provided for new taxa of Central African Russulae: 1 new section, 24 new subsections, 29 new species, 10 new varieties and 1 new form are described; Russula atroviridis nom. nov. is proposed. The descriptions of the different taxa are systematically arranged following Buyck (1989b).
10.2307/3667871|On the base of a rich material collected by the junior author in Kerala, a general survey is given of the genus Hymenagaricus of which the south of India represents probably a dispersal center. The key contains the 18 species known by the authors. The 16 descriptions concern the species collected in Kerala as well as some old collections from Sri Lanka. Hymenagaricus cylindrocystis, H. viridulus, H. calicutensis, H. globisporus, H. subepipastus, H. gracilis, H. luteolosporus, H. chrysosporus, H. rubescens and H. erinaceus are new to Science. H. subaeruginosus, H. epipastus, H. myriostictus and H. flavidorufus are new combinations. The genus is divided into 2 subgenera of which Xanthagaricus subgen. nov.
10.2307/3668145| During two expeditions in 1968, to the Lake Chad and in the Libyan Desert, J. Lonard (BR) has collected an abundant material, essentially constituted by higher plants and containing a small number of fungi. These last specimens are here described. They belong to the following species: Podaxis pistillaris, Tulostoma caespitosum, Schizostoma laceratum s. lat. and Sporisorium modestum (Sydow) H. Scholz comb. nov. The specimen of S. laceratum presents some remarkable characters, a.o. very large size. Those species have not yet been recorded in the countries in which the here described specimens have been collected. 
10.2307/3667648|Revision of the genus Anigozanthos (Haemodoraceae of Australia). -- Description and new diagnosis of the sections and species of this very nice genus, called " Kangaroo paw " by the natives and selected as the State emblem of Western Australia in 1960.
10.2307/3667744|Vernonia kwangolana Duvign. & Hotyat, described from Zaire, is synonymous with V. bullulata S. Moore.
10.2307/3668288|A detailed morphological-anatomical account of the ovary structure and placentation in the tribe Pauridiantheae is given using a bicarpellate taxon, Pauridiantha paucinervis subsp. lyallii, and a tetracarpellate species, Stelechantha ziamaeana, as examples. The presence of false septa (in addition to "true" septa) is characteristic for the entire tribe. They represent inward projections produced by the ovary wall which are only developed in the upper half of an ovary (thus seemingly doubling the number of locules present). The false septa are in contact with the "true" septum (or septa) only in the uppermost part of the ovary; lower down they gradually retreat and, from around mid-ovary, they are no longer discernible. The placentas, on which always many to very many ovules are borne, differ between bi- and more-carpellate taxa of the Pauridiantheae in their size, shape and orientation. It is noted that in the tetracarpellate Stelechantha ziamaeana the placentation is apparently quite similar to that described for the Urophylleae in that each locule has two placenta arms which are at least in part attached to the septa. In bicarpellate Pauridiantha, the placenta is a peltate, more or less heart-shaped structure.
10.2307/3667784|A new monospecific genus of SW Asiatic Cruciferae is described, Petiniotia, based on Sterigmostemum purpurascens (Boiss.) Kuntze from Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan.
10.2307/3667820| Les quelques vestiges des anciens prs de fauche  Colchicum autumnale ont t minutieusement relevs dans la rgion du plateau des Tailles (Haute Ardenne Belge). L'analyse phyto-cologique permet d'y reconnatre deux associations, l'Alchemillo-Trisetetum ressortissant au Triseto-Polygonion et le Crepido-Juncetum dpendant du Calthion. Au sein du premier ensemble, trois variantes se distinguent par leur charge respective en espces msotrophes et xroneutroclines; cette dcoupe est confirme par l'examen des principales conditions stationnelles. Celles-ci montrent encore que plusieurs prairies  colchique n'ont jamais connu l'irrigation; elles se dveloppent sur des alluvions mouilleuses assez peu fertiles. Ces observations apportent quelques prcisions  l'auto-cologie de Colchicum autumnale. 
10.2307/3667985| Les boutures ligneuses dsinfectes sont susceptibles, aprs enracinement, de convenir  la formation de mycorrhizes de synthse. Cette technique a permis de raliser des synthses mycorrhiziennes entre Salix repens et Paxillus involutus et entre S. repens et Pisolithus arhizus. /// Desinfected cuttings of woody plants are suitable for the synthesis of mycorrhizae. This method was applied to the successful formation of mycorrhizae by Paxillus involutus and Pisolithus arhizus on Salix repens. 
10.2307/3668402|The vegetation (woody flora, ferns and orchids) of the forests of Mt Mulanje (Malawi, south-central Africa) is studied along an altitudinal gradient (650-1950 m) from the southern and southeastern slopes to the high plateau of Lichenya. Chorological analysis of the trees and shrubs constituting the different forest types supports recognition of three forest categories: the proportion of Afromontane elements increases from 22% in lowland forest (650-950 m) to 44% in mid-altitude forest (900-1350 m in gorges and middle slopes) and to 76% in Afromontane forest (1600-1950 m on upper slopes and plateaux). The main lowland elements consist of Guineo-Congolian linking species.
