10.2307/4040548|Radioactive sodium salt of 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon) was applied to the leaves or to the roots of sugar beets, a species tolerant of the herbicide, and yellow foxtail (Setaria glauca), a susceptible species. Autoradiographs indicated that dalapon entered through the leaves and roots, and moved throughout all portions of both species within 48 hours. Accumulation of dalapon was greatest in the younger tissues of both species. Paper chromatographic separations of aqueous extracts of the plants indicated no metabolic derivatives of dalapon in either species.
10.2307/4040555|The treatments in this 3-year study consisted of 54, 12, 6, 3, 1, 1/2, and no foxtail plants per foot of crop row. Yield reductions for the heaviest stand of foxtail averaged 25% for corn and 28% for soybeans. For both corn and soybeans, the increase in foxtail dry matter was proportional to the decrease in the dry matter from the crop; the combined yield did not vary significantly. As stand of foxtail increased, there was a decrease in yields of grain, cobs, stalks or straw, diameter of cornstalks, ear weight, light intensity beneath the crop, soil temperatures under corn, and number of soybean pods. There was little or no significant effect on moisture content of grain, height of crop, shelling percentage of corn, oil or protein content of beans, weight of 100 beans or number of beans per pod. Increased corn lodging was associated with increasing foxtail stand in one of three years.
10.2307/4040562|Amiben (3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid) was applied to the surface of various soil types in cylinders which were then leached with water. The leached soil was tested biologically for herbicide activity. Loss was most rapid from sand, followed by clay, with muck remaining phytotoxic much longer. There was only a slight increase in the toxicity of loam soil given repeated treatments with amiben. Incubation of treated soil for various periods of time indicated that microorganism breakdown is important in soils relatively high in organic matter.
10.2307/4040552|Toxicity of 3,6-endoxohexahydrophthalic acid (endothal) was measured by the inhibition of growth of germinating flax roots, compared to known standards. In the field, endothal applied at 0.3 to 10.0 ppm was not detectable after an average of 2 1/2 days, and a maximum of 4 days. In aquaria, endothal at these rates was detectable much longer than this, and much longer when the aquaria contained only water than when they also contained mud and plant debris.
10.2307/4040560|Rhizomes were sampled from quackgrass sod weekly during two seasons. The activity of buds on one-bud sections from mature rhizomes was used to determine periods of growth and dormancy. The rhizome buds showed a steady decrease in activity from mid-April to June 1. During June, the buds were dormant. Recovery began in late June and continued the rest of the summer. Only one-third of all rhizome material in a three-year-old sod was viable. The amount of viable mature rhizomes decreased during the season while the viable new rhizomes increased, and the total viable level remained fairly constant. This suggested a definite cycle in rhizome production and decomposition from year to year and a short life-period in the soil. The term "late-spring dormancy" is suggested for quackgrass rhizomes, based on the prevailing cool and moist weather conditions and the late-spring time of occurrence during the year. This distinguishes the type of dormancy described from "summer dormancy".
10.2307/4040557| Dalapon-2-C, applied as droplets, was employed in tracer studies by autoradiography and counting. That dalapon remained non-metabolized throughout the experiment was confirmed by chromatography. Surfactants greatly enhanced (cuticular) penetration. Small amounts of herbicide were sorbed almost instantaneously (15-30 seconds). Movement away from the treated area "showed" or "appeared as" first a diffusional pattern, but soon became channelized in veinlets and larger vascular bundles. Dalapon applied off the midvein did not enter the midvein in appreciable quantities during basipetal transport. Dalapon which entered the midrib originally remained highly concentrated in this channel. During transport, some dalapon was retained or retarded by tissues through which it passed. Retention was greatest in the basal sections (intercalary meristem regions) of young grass blades. A 10-fold build-up of dalapon was demonstrated following drop application off the main vein, but not after treatment on the midrib. Results are explicable on the basis of the known anatomy of Zea and the translocation of dalapon with assimilates. 
10.2307/4040553| The method was based on the minimum dosage of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) that would produce strapping or cupping of cotton leaves. Dilutions of an unknown were applied to cotton cotyledons. The minimum dosage required to produce strapped or cupped leaves two weeks later was approximately 0.05 g/plant. The results of this bioassay were comparable to tracer methods, but the latter can detect smaller quantities of 2,4-D. 
10.2307/4040564|Wheat, bean, and pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus) seeds were immersed in solutions of 2,4-D (ester) and MCPA (ester) ranging from 0.001 ppm. and then germinated in petri dishes. Both products induced analogous effects but MCPA appeared to be slightly less active. Germination in pigweed was promoted by the 0.1 ppm. solutions. Growth of plummule and radicle in wheat was stimulated by lower (0.001 to 1 ppm.) concentrations and depressed by higher ones (100 and 1000 ppm.), the threshold between stimulation and depression being around 10 to 100 ppm. depending on the product and the organ affected.
10.2307/4040556| Wild cucumber (Sicyos angulatus) and cultivated cucumber (Cucumis sativus) were treated with carboxyl-labeled C2,4-D (2,4-D*) and 2,4,5-T (2,4,5-T*) and autoradiographs developed. The distribution pattern of 2,4-D* was achieved in 24 hours and changed little by the end of 4 or 8 days. The pattern of 2,4,5-T* translocation continued to change during an 8-day period, indicating a highly mobile compound. Metabolic studies indicated that considerably more 2,4-D* than 2,4,5-T* was absorbed by these species but 75% of the absorbed 2,4-D* was converted into two major metabolites within 24 hours. The absorbed 2,4,5-T* formed only traces of these metabolites even after 8 days. Evolution of CO was approximately 10 times greater from 2,4-D*-treated plants than from 2,4,5-T*-treated plants. The greater phytotoxicity of 2,4,5-T on these species seems to be related to the inability of the plants to detoxify this compound as rapidly as 2,4-D. 
10.2307/4040554| Effects of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T), 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) and 4-(2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxy)butyric acid [4-(MCPB)] on Oxalis latifolia H.B.K. were compared. 2,4,5-T killed leaves and up to 50% bulbs, 2,4-D was slightly less effective while MCPA and MCPB killed or distorted leaves but did not affect bulbs appreciably. Effectiveness of spray was increased by spraying in the evening rather than the morning and by applying nutrient solution for three weeks prior to spraying, but spray additives, sucrose, boric acid or urea gave no significant alteration. Studies with C-labelled 2,4-D indicated accumulation in rapidly developing organs with less movement to organs of slower development. 
10.2307/4040565|The percentage of quackgrass (Agropyron repens (L.) Beauv.) rhizome buds producing shoots was greater with one-inch than with six-inch or longer rhizomes. The longer the rhizome cutting, the stronger the shoot and the greater the recovery from deep planting. Recovery of rhizomes covered with four or more inches of soil was poor. Atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropyl-amino-s-triazine) at 1 1/2 and 3 lb per acre did not affect the number of shoots produced. It was more effective when applied 1/2 inch above rhizomes than one inch or three inches above them.
10.2307/4040558|Species studied at Lincoln, Nebraska for 4 years were downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.), hairy chess (B. commutatus Schrad.), Japanese chess (B. japonicus Thunb.), and cheat (B. secalinus L.). These grasses were usually winter annuals, but also became spring annuals or biennials when sown in late March or early April. In the greenhouse, an inductive period either of vernalization or short day lengths appeared necessary for panicle production by downy brome and hairy chess. For both species, long day lengths following the inductive period were necessary for flowering. When a mixture of smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.) and 5.4 per cent of weed bromegrasses was sown in the fall, weed bromes made up 48 per cent of the total basal density and 87 per cent of the total seed yield the following summer. Panicles of weed bromes were absent or nearly so when this mixture was soon after April 1. The best time for mowing hairy chess and downy brome for their control in pasture was approximately one week after the heads had emerged. Practical control of weed bromegrasses has generally been obtained by prevention of seed production for two years. A practical program has included killing all emerged weed bromegrasses by tillage between April 1 and heading. A spring cereal or row crop, such as corn or sorghum, was then planted. The next season, timely tillage followed by the above crops, or summer fallow, has permitted return of fields to the usual alternate winter wheat and fallow sequence. Effective control of weed bromegrasses also was accomplished by isopropyl N-phenylcarbamate (IPC), isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate (CIPC), 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron), sodium salt of trichloracetic acid (TCA), 3,6-endoxohexahydrophthalic acid (endothal), 4,6-dinitro-o-sec-amylphenol (DNAP), and mixtures of these herbicides.
10.2307/4040549|The sodium salt of 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon) at 4 lb per acre was applied as a foliar spray to sugar beets, a species tolerant of the herbicide, and yellow foxtail (Setaria glauca), a susceptible species. Shoots of treated and untreated plants were collected during three weeks after treatment and assayed. Dalapon appeared to cause protein degradation to amino acids in the shoots of both species. Striking increases in the concentration of amides (primarily glutamine in sugar beets and asparagine in yellow foxtail) were found. The free pantothenic acid in the shoots of both species rose greatly following treatment. In sugar beets, observed recovery of treated plants was accompanied by return of the concentrations of the constituents studied to levels near those in untreated plants. Yellow foxtail did not recover after treatment and concentrations of the constituents studied generally remained at a high level compared to the untreated plants. The similarity in initial biochemical responses of the two species and the fact that sugar beets recovered may indicate that some mechanism capable of inactivating dalapon was operating in sugar beets.
10.2307/4040561|In semi-arid areas, good control of field bindweed with 1 lb/A of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) will occur if there is at least 1.5 inches of available soil moisture when runners are 6 to 10 inches long. Under these conditions carbohydrates are high in the leaves and low in the roots. Analysis of rainfall records from Amarillo, Texas indicates that soil moisture conditions during May will be favorable for good bindweed control with 2,4-D 54% of the time.
10.2307/4040566|Placements which did not wet the root collar and sprouting zone gave poor kills of roots.
10.2307/4040559|Among 15 different herbicides tested for eradication of Turkey oak (Quercus laevis Walt.) over a period of four years on Lakeland fine sand in Florida, only monuron, diuron, and fenuron at minimal rates of 10 lb/A were effective. One full growing season after application was required for complete kill. Phenoxy compounds gave variable top-kill but not satisfactory control. AMS, dalapon, and four formulations of benzoic acid were ineffective in these tests. Out of 13 different grasses, Pensacola bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Flugge) and weeping lovegrass (Eragrostis curvula Schrad.) were best adapted to these deep sandy soils. Seedbed preparation was essential to obtain a good stand of either. After establishment, the lovegrass vigorously persisted throughout the experiment; the bahia also persisted but the lack of fertilization was extremely evident. Both grasses could be established satisfactorily on soil treated two years earlier with monuron or diuron at 10 lb/A.
10.2307/4040551|The effect of PBA, dalapon and amitrole applications on the osmotic pressure, electrical conductivity and pH of quackgrass rhizome sap and the total nitrogen and hygroscopic capacity of dried rhizomes, from May 17 through October 15, are reported. Characteristic seasonal curves were developed for all five specific factors studied. The herbicide treatments accentuated the variation in some of these factors but did not appreciably modify the seasonal curves.
10.2307/4040550|The toxicity indices to cotton of 12 soil-incorporated herbicides were highly and positively correlated with soil organic matter, cation exchange capacity, exchangeable calcium, moisture equivalent, free drainage value and total exchangeable bases. The characteristics of the responses indicate that adsorption of the 12 herbicides on organic matter occurs and that this greatly affects their toxicity. For equal toxicity approximately five times more herbicide was required at 20% organic matter than at 4% regardless of the herbicide involved.
10.2307/4040563| Carboxyl labeled 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) was applied to ironweed, a perennial composite, at various stages of growth in the field and greenhouse. During phases of rapid plant development, C tended to concentrate in new leaves, axillary buds, petioles and stems. As plants approached full vegetative development greater quantities were detected in rhizomes and roots and less in stems and leaves. The herbicide was translocated readily into new leaves, stems and roots of ironweed seedlings. Considerable quantities of 2,4-D-C absorbed by ironweed were rapidly metabolized to compounds not extracted by alcohol. Non-herbicide activity was also found in alcohol extracted fractions. C accumulations in field-treated ironweed were detected in roots and rhizomes 3 to 6 weeks after treatment. 
10.2307/4040845|In trials by three methods, witchweed (Striga asiatica) did not parasitize pineapple.
10.2307/4040827|In undrained soil or solution cultures of oats or barley, the effects of hours of exposure and concentration of 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon) on height and fresh weight were equivalent. Dalapon was shown to be a growth inhibitor in corn coleoptile and pea stem sections but was inactive in oat coleoptile sections. Dalapon was antagonistic to IAA induced growth in corn coleoptile sections and 2,4-D induced growth in pea stem and oat coleoptile sections. The antagonism was reversible in pea and oat tissue, but was competitive in pea stem sections. Dalapon was shown to be an anti-auxin.
10.2307/4040833|The effects of rainfall and temperature upon herbicidal activity of 2-chloro-N,N-diallylacetamide (CDAA), 2-chloro-4,6-bis-(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine), and 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine), for the control of foxtail (Setaria spp.) were determined. CDAA spray was effective if applied to warm soil and if 1/2 inch of rain fell during the first week after application, unless a heavy rain fell immediately after application. The effectiveness of granules was not impaired by a heavy rain immediately after treatment or by a delay of 2 weeks before receiving 1/2 inch of rain. Simazine and atrazine sprays and granules were effective if 1 inch of rain fell within 15 days after application of simazine or if 1/2 to 1 inch fell within 15 to 20 days afterwards for atrazine. Mechanical incorporation aided in activation of simazine when rainfall was slightly below minimum required for activation.
10.2307/4040829|Repeated applications of amine methylarsonate over a two year period resulted in significant reductions in nutsedge tuber numbers at 1.3, 2.6 and 3.8 ounces per 1000 sq. ft. Single annual applications of amine methylarsonate at the same rates were ineffective. Amine methylarsonate and disodium monomethylarsonate treatments gave moderate reductions in nutsedge tuber numbers in thin Bermudagrass turf after one season.
10.2307/4040830|Mixed stands of big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.) and green rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus (Hook.) Nutt.) were sprayed with butyl ester of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) at 1, 2, 3, and 4 lb/A on six phenological dates in 1956, 1957, and 1958 at the Squaw Butte Experiment Station, Burns, Oregon. Data on soil moisture; soil temperature; growth development of herbaceous species; twig elongation of big sagebrush and green rabbitbrush; dry-matter, crude-protein, and total-carbohydrate contents of green rabbitbrush herbage; and crude-protein and total-carbohydrate contents of big sagebrush and green rabbitbrush roots were obtained at weekly to biweekly intervals in all 3 years to evaluate the ecological and physiological conditions that might indicate seasonal patterns of susceptibility to 2,4-D. Big sagebrush, a non-deciduous, non-sprouting plant, was easily killed with 2,4-D at 2 lb/A when soil temperatures and moisture contents were satisfactory for vigorous growth. The development of abundant leaf area on green rabbitbrush, a deciduous, sprouting plant, was important for spray interception and a photosynthetic rate sufficient to promote carbohydrate accumulation. Green rabbitbrush was controlled about 80% with a single application of 2,4-D butyl ester at 3 lb/A after the new twigs were 3 inches long and while soil moisture contents were sufficient for active growth. Differences in susceptibility between the two species are compared with morphological, phenological, and physiological differences, and seasonal patterns of susceptibility are further compared with environmental conditions.
10.2307/4040846|Seeds of witchweed (Striga asiatica) were found in undisturbed Lakeland sand in all layers to 60 inches deep.
10.2307/4040831| Radioactive sucrose-C and serine-C were "fed" to excised leaves from red kidney bean plants at various times following atrazine treatment. The distribution of C in the various labeled compounds was determined by two-dimensional paper chromatography and subsequent elution and counting. The results indicated that other processes entirely independent of the photosynthetic block are also involved in the herbicidal action. Atrazine did not affect the rate of respiration of excised embryos of red kidney bean plants. 
10.2307/4040832|Inulin or a closely related analog was the major available carbohydrate component of western ironweed (Vernonia baldwinii Torr.) roots. Fructose, glucose, sucrose and other glucofructosans made up the remaining carbohydrate fraction. Reductions in ironweed vigor as a result of annual mowing were caused by a decrease in dry weight of the root system rather than a permanent decrease in carbohydrate percentage. Use of carbohydrate percentage in predicting a physiological condition of ironweed was regarded as questionable. Carbohydrate content of roots was not necessarily related to stage of growth. Treatment of ironweed with 2,4-D did not permanently affect carbohydrate levels in the roots. Changes in root carbohydrate content after 2,4-D treatment were not considered decisive in killing ironweed.
10.2307/4040847|This herbicide, plus the 2,4 and 2,4,5 compounds, has remained active in the soil for 6 years on a Norfolk fine sandy loam in an area with about 49 inches of rainfall per year. The residue produced formative effects on tobacco leaves throughout this time.
10.2307/4040839|Fish used in these tests were the Israeli strain of the common carp, Cyprinus carpio; the Nile tilapia, Tilapia nilotica; the Java tilapia, T. mossambica; and the Congo tilapia, T. melanopleura. Israeli carp and either Nile or Java tilapia in ponds containing only these species virtually eliminated aquatic weeds, but when stocked into established populations of largemouth bass and bluegill results were less encouraging.
10.2307/4040836|Excavation at biweekly intervals for 20 weeks of nutsedge clones grown from single tubers indicated that no dormant tubers formed until 6 weeks after foliar emergence. Tuber chains or fully mature rhizomes were not observed until the tenth week or long tuber chains until the eighteenth week. Rhizome length and tuber-basal bulb number increased throughout the season. Development of clones varied.
10.2307/4040840|The propylene glycol butyl ether ester of 2,4-D or the dimethylamine salt of 2,3,6-TBA in 25 gallons water per acre effectively controlled Colorado rubberweed (Hymenoxys richardsonii (Hook.) Cockerell) at the prebud stage. From 2 to 4 pounds acid equivalent per acre of an ester of 2,4-D were satisfactory, depending on the relative importance of cost and speed of kill.
10.2307/4040837| Approximately 75% of the inhibitory effect of a foliar application of 4-chloro-2-butynyl N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamate (barban) on wheat was eliminated by dusting the seed before planting with 4-chloro-2-hydroxyiminoacetanilide at a rate of one ounce per bushel. Other highly effective antidotes were 2,4-dichloro-9-xanthenone and N-methyl-3,4-dichlorobenzene sulfonamide. Barban antidotes were found in those chemicals that produced formative effects on plants. 
10.2307/4040843|Fresh seed of Tamarix pentandra Pall. germinated at 36 to 132 F., freely at 66 to 110 F. Seed stored at the same relative humidity maintained viability best at low temperatures. Viability of seed stored at a low relative humidity continued high for 6 months over a wide range of temperature, but viability was reduced within 15 days by relative humidity of 90-95%.
10.2307/4040828|For the control of wild garlic in Missouri in comparison with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) during 1954-1960, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole), sodium 2,2-dichloropropionate (dalapon), maleic hydrazide (MH), 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid (fenac) and 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA) were effective. 2,3,6-TBA alone was more effective than 2,4-D. The toxicity of 2,3,6-TBA was increased by addition of a wetting agent. Heavy spot treatments of wild garlic with 2,3,6-TBA killed the established plants, but did not eradicate wild garlic because of sprouting of dormant bulbs.
10.2307/4040838|Red alder (Alnus rubra Bong.) was readily killed by growing season treatments with a 1 to 1 mixture of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) in diesel oil. Except for 1-inch-diameter trees, it was resistant to dormant season treatments. Treatments applied during moderate rain were less effective than during rain-free periods.
10.2307/4040842|A mobile, metal cabinet sprayer is described, in which an electrically-powered, chain-driven carriage with spray assembly travels back and forth over the pots or flats to be sprayed.
10.2307/4040835|In field plantings, granular 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) and 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron) were the most effective herbicides, but injured Spiraea media, S. trichocarpa, Syringa prestoniae and Physocarpus opulifolius. Diuron also injured newly planted evergreens. Granular 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben), isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamate (CIPC), 2-chloroallyl diethyldithiocarbamate (CDEC) and 4,6-dinitro-o-sec-butylphenol (DNBP) did not cause injury. Preplanting application of ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (EPTC) reduced the vigor of the deciduous shrubs. Chamaecyparis and Thuja species were tolerant to simazine under greenhouse conditions, while tolerance in Juniperus varied according to species.
10.2307/4040841|A 7-foot V-plow was modified so herbicides could be sprayed beneath the soil surface in stubble mulch fallow operations. This permits the incorporation of volatile herbicides without destroying plant residues. Weed control is achieved by action of the 7-foot sweeps during the herbicide application and later by the incorporated herbicide.
10.2307/4040834|The herbicide, N-(3-chloro-4-methylphenyl)-2-methylpentanamide was applied to the foliage of tomato, a tolerant species, and eggplant, a susceptible species. Both species increased in tolerance to the herbicide with age but tomato increased at a much faster rate. Selectivity did not appear to be a function of differential wetting of foliage. Photosynthesis was shown to be involved in the phytotoxic action of the herbicide and starvation is suggested as a possible mode of action. Carbohydrates increased the tolerance of tomato plants and the fixation of labeled carbon dioxide in eggplant leaves was prevented by the herbicide.
10.2307/4040654|Patterns of absorption and distribution of dalapon (2,2-dichloropropionic acid) were determined by radioautography and counting. Dalapon was absorped through the cuticle and through the large open pores of hypostomatous leaves. Stomata were clearly the most expeditious routes of entry, but results were erratic when no surfactant was included. An anionic surfactant, sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate, enhanced both (a) cuticular and (b) stomatal plus cuticular penetration 3- to 4-fold during a 2-hr. absorption period. Studies confirmed the view that dalapon is translocated to regions of high metabolic activity and/or storage in association with and dependent upon the movement of food materials. Dalapon did not move appreciably out of albino leaves or green leaves previously depleted of food reserves, but was transported readily out of normal leaves in the light when a surfactant was used to enhance cuticular penetration.
10.2307/4040658|In the Peace River region, vegetative shoots of field horsetail, Equisetum arvense L., emerge from June 1 to July 1, and reach full growth about July 16. All herbicides studied were most effective applied July 16 to 30. Amitrole (3-amino-1,2,4-triazole) at 8 lb/A at this time gave 96% stand reduction the next year. For selective killing in barley, MCPA (2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid) at 4 to 8 oz/A killed 100% of the top growth in the year of application and gave 50 to 65% stand reduction the next year. Other herbicides tried were less effective.
10.2307/4040664| A procedure has been described for the partial purification of the simazine-resistance factor of Zea. The relative solubilities in various solvents and some of the chemical properties of this factor have been studied. Pyridine and hydroxylamine were also found to bring about the conversion of simazine- C to the 2-hydroxy analogue. Based on these substances as models, a mechanism has been proposed for the dechlorination of simazine in Zea. 
10.2307/4040659|All herbicides were incorporated either as pretransplanting or posttransplanting treatments. Herbicides used were: ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (EPTC), propyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (1607), ethyl N,N-ethyl-n-butylthiolcarbamate (2060), propyl N,N-ethyl-n-butylthiolcarbamate (2061), O-(2,4-dichlorophenyl) O-methyl isopropylphosphoramidothioate (DMPA), 2-chloro-4-diethylamino-6-ethylamino-s-triazine (trietazine), and the dimethyl ester of 2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalic acid (DCPA). EPTC, 1607, 2060, and 2061 at 3 lb/A (repeated 3 times), posttransplanting, and DMPA at 20 lb/A, pretransplanting, gave control of the annual weeds present with the exception of annual morningglory, and had no effects on tobacco yield or value. Nicotine, nornicotine, total alkaloids, and reducing sugar content of the cured leaf were not adversely affected by the thiolcarbamates, DMPA, amiben, or DCPA at rates used. Smoke and taste tests of tobacco treated with EPTC, DMPA, amiben, and DCPA revealed no undesirable flavors.
10.2307/4040657|Applications of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyethyl sulfate (sesone) were made to obtain a wide range of formative response in peanut seedlings. These reactions were rated (0 = no effect, 10 = complete kill) as the peanut seedlings emerged, and correlated with growth and development of the plants. It appears that plants from seedlings in the 0 to 3 range of response have an excellent chance to develop into healthy, productive plants. The seedlings in the 3 to 5 range have a questionable chance. The seedlings in the 6 to 10 range have little chance, because root rots were both frequent and severe at 8 to 9 weeks after seeding.
10.2307/4040661|Winter wheat infested with four populations of coast fiddleneck (Amsinckia intermedia Fisch. & May) was treated with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). One weed per square foot reduced grain yield. Weeds competed strongly as early as the rosette stage. Treating the weed infested wheat with 2,4-D increased yield. A vigorous, early-established crop of wheat competed effectively with the weeds.
10.2307/4040656|Nutsedge tubers germinated readily in soil treated with EPTC. However, growth was suppressed and emergence delayed, the delay depending on the rate of application. EPTC at 12 and 16 pounds per acre with 8 and 12 weeks exposure was very effective in killing nutsedge tubers as indicated by tuber germination and condition of tubers that did not germinate. The granular formulation of EPTC killed highly significantly more nutsedge tubers than the emulsifiable formulation. Repeat applications of EPTC were significantly better in terms of tubers killed than single applications of the same rate of the herbicide. Thorough incorporation of EPTC to a depth of 5 inches of mechanical means was significantly more effective than incorporation by leaching.
10.2307/4040665|Seedlings of barnyardgrass, green foxtail, and yellow foxtail emerged from seeds as deep as 5 inches in Sagemoor fine sandy loam. The number of emerged seedlings from depths of 4 to 5 inches decreased in the order of decreasing seed weights; yellow foxtail, barnyardgrass, green foxtail. Few seedlings developed in the field from seeds on the soil surface. Seedling emergence in spring or greenhouse seedings was greatest from the most shallow depths (1/2 or 1 inch) and decreased regularly as depth of planting increased. An autumn seeding gave maximum emergence at 1 1/2 inches, possibly because some seeds sown shallower may have germinated in short warm periods but were killed by subsequent freezing.
10.2307/4040666|Comparative studies of herbicides and herbicide mixtures were conducted at Tifton, Georgia, in 1959 and 1960. Certain mixtures, which contained sodium 2,4-dichlorophenoxyethyl sulfate (sesone), tris(2,4-dichlorophenoxyethyl) phosphite (2,4-DEP), or the triethylamine salt of 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben) mixed with the alkanolamine salt of 4,6-dinitro-o-sec-butylphenol (DNBP), gave seasonal weed control on band-treated peanuts. Compared to herbicides applied singly, mixtures not only increased the spectrum of weeds controlled but also permitted the use of the lowest rate of each component on the weeds for which it was most effective.
10.2307/4040663|Medusahead (Elymus caput-medusae L.) matures later in the spring than most associated species, and has a seed head moisture content of above 30 per cent for approximately a month after leaves and stems begin to dry. High temperature is more injurious to seed viability when seed moisture content is high. Control burns of medusahead infested rangeland were most effective in late afternoon when burning slowly (into a mild wind) and at the soft dough stage of medusahead seed development.
10.2307/4040651|Cluster tarweed (Madia glomerata Hook.) is an annual which occupies rangeland from Saskatchewan to N. Arizona at medium to high elevations. In the laboratory dried tarweed plants and leachates from them reduced the germination of intermediate wheatgrass (Agropyron intermedium (Host) Beauv.) and radish, and caused high proportions of abnormal seedlings. The inhibitory agent(s) was highly water soluble, dialyzable, stable to boiling, drying, and prolonged storage in solution, destroyed by ashing, and not affected by pH 4 to 7. In soil in the greenhouse, tarweed leachates and dried tarweed significantly reduced growth of wheatgrass seedlings. In the field, tarweed infestation reduced the establishment and growth of wheatgrass sown in it in proportion to the stand of tarweed.
10.2307/4040655|A significant amount of amiben (3-amino-2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid) was leached from the 0 to 1-inch soil depth with 1 and 2 inches of applied water. Weed control could be obtained from amiben at 1 lb/A if rain came within 3 or 4 days after application. One-half inch of water applied immediately after application markedly increased the toxicity of 1 lb of amiben per acre to Brassica juncea (L.) Coss and Panicum miliaceum L.; a similar response from 2 lb/A was obtained with 1/4 inch of water. As the amiben rate was increased, less water was required for optimum weed control. Increased water and/or amiben applications were required with Brassica campestris L., which is somewhat resistant to amiben.
10.2307/4040653|Spot-treatments of young cotton with 2,2-dichloropropionic acid, simulating control of clumps of perennial grass, resulting in 10 to 25% reductions in cotton stands, did not cause proportional reductions in yields of seed cotton. Increased growth of cotton plants adjacent to skips compensated for reduced stands. The treatments did not affect boll components or fiber properties of cotton.
10.2307/4040662|During a 48 hour period after spraying with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) the ribonucleic acid (RNA) in the subcellular particles of soybean hypocotyl tissue doubled with over half of the increase appearing in the microsomal fraction and one quarter in the soluble fraction. It is hoypothesized that the herbicidal action of 2,4-D lies in a renewal of nuclear activity in the tissue, leading to a synthesis of RNA and protein and to tissue proliferation, and that the cytochemical basis of auxin-herbicide action lies in a reversion to a meristematic metabolism.
10.2307/4040660|Weed control has been a major problem in Hawaiian pineapple production. Hand-hoeing and mechanical cultivation gave way to activated oil emulsion sprays in the 1940's. The 1950's brought the use of preemergence herbicides especially 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron). Each method has brought a shift in species distribution. Today, large-seeded species and vegetatively-propagated species are less well-controlled than in the days of contact weeding with oil emulsion sprays. There is need for selective herbicides which will control the weeds which escape the present program.
10.2307/4040652|Yellow rocket (Barbarea vulgaris R. Br.) was studied for 5 years under field conditions. Yellow rocket seeds germinated throughout the growing season, but vernalization of the rosettes formed was necessary for flowering. There appeared to be a minimum size plant that could be vernalized. In the spring vernalized rosettes formed flower stalks. As the flower stalk elongated, basal rosette leaves died, giving the impression of an annual. When the flower stalk was cut or seed matured, new rosette leaves developed from buds on the crown. This new growth was capable of going through the subsequent winter. Marked plants survived for at least 3 years. The ability to flower again and set viable seed in the same year after cutting appeared to be associated with the stage of the original flower stalk when cut. Yellow rocket is perennial, but it may not survive after its second year under conditions of disease or strong competition.
10.2307/4040781|Oats, sesbania (Sesbania macrocarpa Muhl.) and purple nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus L.) were grown as test plants in nine different soil types treated with 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 ppm of ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (EPTC). Toxicity of EPTC was negatively correlated with the organic matter of the soil. A positive correlation was found between the sand and silt content of the soil and EPTC toxicity to oats and nutsedge. Toxicity of EPTC was not correlated with soil pH, cation exchange capacity, clay content, general reaction, or parent material. EPTC induced a dormancy of nutsedge tubers, of which the length was inversely related to the organic content of the soil.
10.2307/4040782|Isopropyl N-phenylcarbamate (IPC) and isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamate (CIPC) were the most effective herbicides for controlling downy brome without serious injury to perennial grasses grown for seed production in eastern Washington. The di-sodium salt of 3,6-endoxohexahydrophthallic acid (endothal) gave good downy brome control at Spokane, but was not satisfactory for control at Hooper and Pomeroy, Washington.
10.2307/4040789|Seeds of white spruce (Picea glauca, Moench), Colorado spruce (P. pungens, Engelm.), and Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) were treated with simazine in water at rates up to 1000 ppm for 20 hours, washed 10 min., rinsed twice, and sown. There was no effect on Colorado spruce or Scotch pine, but white spruce seeds were seriously affected above 250 ppm. Simazine has been considered not to affect seeds.
10.2307/4040792| Carbon carboxy labeled 2,4-D with varied amounts of Tween 20 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate) was applied to excised Kalmia angustifolia L. (Ericaceae) leaves and, after an absorption period, the radioactivity of the dried ground leaf tissue was measured by counting. Entry rate of 2,4-D into recently formed leaves decreased with increase in Tween 20, within the range of 2,4-D/Tween 20 ratios used (roughly 5/1 to 0.5/1). Entry rate of 2,4-D into older leaves increased with increase in Tween 20. 
10.2307/4040786|Disking, relisting, cultivation and no repreparation were employed in repreparing for planting seedbeds that had received preemergence treatment with 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)1,1-dimethylurea (diuron). Only the relisting method of seedbed repreparation appeared hazardous with respect to crop injury from herbicidal residues. Retreatment with diuron tended to increase injury symptoms in replanted cotton but yields were not significantly reduced by retreatment. Early-season weed competition, preventable by preemergence treatment, appeared to be more hazardous to yields than slight to moderate herbicidal injury to the cotton. Cotton replanted on plots treated once or treated twice significantly outyielded that on untreated plots in one of the two years in which all plots were replanted.
10.2307/4040790|Salmonberry (Rubus spectabilis Pursh.) was basally treated in Western Oregon during the dormant season and at bud bursting in April, using a 1:1 mixture of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T), and the same mixture of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T monobutyl ether glycol esters, and 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA), in two carriers and with different additives, and with diesel oil alone. January applications gave generally poorer results than those in March and April. March and April applications produced 100% defoliation and kill for all treatments, with only erratic exceptions. Diesel oil alone gave effective control only in April. Sprays containing 2 1/2% active ingredients gave as good results as those containing 5%.
10.2307/4040791|A year's study of the kinds of weed seeds caught in an 18-mesh copper screen intercepting half the canal width found seeds of 20 species or genera. Bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon) was found every month of the year; saltgrass (Distichlis spicata) only in March; others in 2 to 10 months of the year.
10.2307/4040784|White mustard (Brassica hirta Moench) and foxtail millet (Setaria italica (L.) Beauv.), thinned to uniform stands, varied in a three-year study in their effects on peas depending on weed population, duration of competition, relative time of pea and weed emergence, and year to year variations in seasonal rainfall. Full-season competition from 3 mustard plants per square foot reduced pea stands 0 to 25%, pea vine weight 39 to 71%, and yields of shelled peas 0 to 64%, during the three years. In one direct comparison, 27 foxtail plants per square foot caused reductions in peas comparable to those caused by 3 mustard plants. When mustard emerged 3 days before peas, fresh weight of pea vines was reduced 54 percent; but when mustard emerged 4 days after peas, only 17 percent. The relative growth rates of peas, Brassica hirta, B. Kaber, Amaranthus retroflexus, Polygonum Persicaria, Setaria italica, S. viridis, S. glauca, and Echinochloa crusgalli grown without intra- and inter-species competition suggest that the Brassica species would be the more severe competitors with peas and that weed competition usually would be more severe in late-seeded peas.
10.2307/4040785| The effect of 4,6-dinitro-o-sec-butylphenol(DNBP) and several phenylureas, s-triazines, chlorinated phenoxyacetic acids and chlorinated benzoic acids on the photolytic activity (Hill reaction) of chloroplasts isolated from turnip greens (Brassica spp.) was studied. Photochemical activity was measured potentiometrically with ferricyanide as the electron acceptor. For the various members of each herbicidal group close agreements were obtained between inhibitions expressed against the Hill reaction and their relative phytotoxicities, except for the chlorinated benzoic acids. Of the five phenylureas tested, 1-n-butyl-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methylurea (neburon) and 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron) were most inhibitory and 3-phenyl-1,1-dimethylurea (fenuron) was least inhibitory to the Hill reaction. 2-Chloro-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (propazine) and 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) were the most inhibitory and 2-chloro-4,6-bis(diethylamino)-s-triazine (chlorazine) was the least inhibitory of seven s-triazines to the Hill reaction. DNBP inhibited the Hill reaction by 50 percent (I) at 1.3  10 M. An I value of 5.1  10 M was obtained for 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) which was the most inhibitory of the chlorinated phenoxyacetic acids tested. 3,4,5-Trichlorobenzoic acid (3,4,5-TBA) was the most inhibitory chlorinated benzoic acid tested (I = 2  10M). I values were established and compared for chloroplasts isolated from turnip greens, corn and soybeans for diuron, simazine, DNBP, isopropyl N-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)carbamate (3,4-DCIPC), isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamate (CIPC), 2,4,5-T and 3,4,5-TBA. Chloroplasts from the three species were essentially equally sensitive to each of the seven herbicides. Hence, no evidence was obtained which would explain species tolerance or susceptibility. When turnip-green chloroplasts were treated with inhibitory concentrations of diuron, simazine, DNBP, CIPC, 2,4,5-T and 3,4,5-TBA in the dark, the herbicides could be removed by washing without seriously impairing the photolytic activity of the chloroplasts. However, irreversible changes occurred when the chloroplasts were illuminated while in contact with the herbicides, i.e., photolytic activity was not completely restored when the chloroplasts were washed, except with simazine. 
10.2307/4040778|Chemical control of weeds in the Hawaiian sugar industry began in 1913 when experiments with sodium arsenite were first conducted on the Island of Hawaii. Sodium arsenite and some sodium chlorate were the main herbicides in use until a concentrated, activated diesel emulsion (CADE) was developed in 1944. From that time on the chlorophenoxyacetic acids and their compounds, sodium trichloroacetate, sodium 2,2-dichloropropionate, and the substituted ureas and triazines have, in turn, been incorporated into use on plantations for weed control. At present, over a half million acres are sprayed each year at a cost of nearly seven million dollars for labor and material.
10.2307/4040783|The relative tolerance of cucumber and squash to amiben was established for germinating seeds, and for young plants with both foliage and root applications. In all cases, the dosage required for 50% inhibition of growth was 6 to 8 times greater for squash than for cucumber. Root applications of carbon-14 labeled amiben on reciprocal grafts of cucumber and squash plants indicated that the shoots were spared in these experiments by differential blocking of amiben transport from the roots. Shoots of either species appeared tolerant on squash roots and susceptible on cucumber roots. Radioactivity in the shoots of both species was much greater when grafted on cucumber than on squash. Foliage applications of carbon-14 labeled amiben showed more entry into cucumber than squash, but little movement to untreated plant parts in either species.
10.2307/4040788| Aqueous solutions of sodium and calcium polysulfides convert labeled simazine, 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine-2,4,6-C, to a chloroform insoluble, charcoal adsorbable derivative which is thought to be hydroxysimazine, 2-hydroxy-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine-2,4,6-C. In soil, calcium polysulfide accelerates the breakdown of simazine as shown by oat bioassay. These results suggest the possibility of using polysulfides to remove unwanted residues of chlorotriazine herbicides from crop lands. 
10.2307/4040774|The present importance of the discipline of weed control is outlined. More acres in the United States are treated today for weed control than for the control of insects or plant diseases, despite disparity in personnel engaged; e.g., a total in the North Central region of 44 men in weed control, 176 in entomology and 177 in plant pathology.
10.2307/4040775|A review, particularly of the responses to herbicides of photosynthetic processes at the molecular level, with some discussion of the effects of herbicides on cell membranes.
10.2307/4040777|Witchweed (Striga asiatica), a parasitic chlorophyll-bearing plant (Scrophuladiaceae) which attacks corn, sorghum, sugarcane, and more than 60 other important crop plants and weeds belonging to the grass family, was found in North Carolina and South Carolina in 1956. It presents a potential hazard to the production of grain crops with an annual value of more than 5 billion dollars in the United States. Continued extensive surveys indicate that witchweed is now present in 20 counties in North Carolina and 10 in South Carolina on a total of 9,566 farms containing 210,671 acres. Federal interstate and state intrastate quarantines (the first for a weed in the U. S.) were established to reduce its spread. Witchweed produces up to 500,000 microscopic longlived seeds per plant. These do not usually germinate until stimulated by a chemical stimulant secreted by the roots of certain plants. A stimulant has been isolated from corn but its exact chemical structure has not be determined. More than 300 chemicals have been evaluated in the laboratory in attempts to find a synthetic stimulant. Of these, 18 stimulated witchweed seed germination in the laboratory but they have not been evaluated for their effectiveness in controlling witchweed under field conditions. After 4 years of catch or trap crops, excellent control of witchweed has been obtained and highly profitable crops of corn have been produced on heavily infested land. Corn grown continuously with witchweed seed production prevented by 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid [2,4-D] has resulted in excellent witchweed control and high corn yields. Corn grown continuously receiving 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid [fenac] as a pre-planting soil-incorporated treatment and 2,4-D as a post-emergence spray as needed have proved effective full-season control of witchweed. Tobacco and certain other crops cannot be grown in rotation with corn for a period of 2 years after this treatment because of fenac residues in the soil. Other herbicides as pre-planting soil-incorporated or premergence treatments to control broadleaved and grass-type weeds plus 2,4-D to prevent witchweed seed production have been highly effective combinations for witchweed control. Quick eradication of witchweed will not be easy but effective control now and future eradication look favorable.
10.2307/4040787|Annual treatment with 1 lb/A of 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) repeated for several years during mid- to late June gave excellent control of ironweed (Vernonia baldwinii). Later dates of treatment were not as effective. Mowing was not satisfactory as a weed control measure for ironweed. The populations in mowed plots in long-term experiments closely paralleled populations of untreated plots. Where numbers were reduced by spray treatment, recovery or reinfestation was comparatively slow. Quadrat counts were compared with visual estimation as methods of evaluating effects of treatments. The estimation method did not permit quantitative evaluation of year-to-year treatment or environmental effects.
10.2307/4040776|A review of recent work, especially, on the multitude of factors affecting the germination of weed seeds.
10.2307/4040780|During the first season, tubers of purple nutsedge, Cyperus rotundus L. planted in Piedmont Plateau soil at Experiment, Georgia at 1-ft intervals produced 3,090,000 plants and 4,420,000 tubers and bulbs per acre. Tubers planted at 3-ft intervals produced 2,320,000 plants and 2,760,000 tubers and bulbs. The differences were not pronounced at the end of the second season. A single cultivation at the beginning of the second year did not appreciably affect the number of tubers and bulbs formed. Continuous heavy shade during the second year reduced tuber-bulb formation. No apparent interaction between shading and cultivation occurred.
10.2307/4041115| Results were based on plant response with light levels in energy units, in accord with use of the spectrum by plants. Dry weight yields of control plants, and reductions of yields by 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) below those of control plants were greatest in red light, followed by pink, yellow, white, green, and blue light, in that order. Sucrose mixed with 2,4-D or applied alone to plants altered the combined light-herbicide effect but little. Differences in concentration of 2,4-D affected respiration more than photosynthesis, as measured by CO exchange under different light qualities. In spectral effects, pink light caused greatest reduction of photosynthesis by 2,4-D at 500 ppm, while greatest promotion of respiration occurred under red light with 2,4-D at 1000 ppm. 
10.2307/4041123|A substantial movement of sugar from alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) to dodder (Cuscuta sp.) was noted in all experiments, while autoradiograms indicated little or no movement from the parasite to the host. Even when metabolic activities in the host were limited, dodder continued to withdraw sugars from the host.
10.2307/4041126|Internal dormancy (the state of internally arrested growth) in western ironweed (Vernonia baldwini Torr.) buds consisted of a recurring annual cycle of high and low activity with transition periods. Trends in sprouting activity were similar regardless of whether activity was measured by sprouting of buds following removal of stems in the field, or by sprouting of rhizome section buds in moist sand. Bud activity measurement was quantitatively different by the two methods, however, and the apparent period when internal dormancy developed also differed. A number of interdependent factors modified activity. At various points in the cycle, the stem apex inhibited bud growth; the stem alone inhibited bud growth; a transient block due to immaturity occurred in some buds; and two temperature-related blocks occurred. Bud age and location on the rhizome had little effect on activity. During the period of internal dormancy, sprouting of buds apparently stimulated activity of adjacent buds. Temperature greatly affected expression of internal dormancy; prolonged moist cold treatment eliminated it.
10.2307/4041136| The specific and general postemergence herbicidal properties of N-4-(4-chlorophenoxy)phenyl-N,N-dimethylurea [chloroxuron] were influenced by formulation and the carrier employed. 
10.2307/4041122|Imopea purpurea (L.) Roth and I. hederacea (L.) Jacq. significantly and equally reduced soybean yields and plant height, and increased lodging and the difficulty of harvesting. Damage to soybeans increased as the population of morningglories increased. Control of morningglories was needed for 6 to 8 weeks from the date of soybean planting. Morningglories germinated throughout the season and emerged from a depth of 6 inches below the soil surface.
10.2307/4041111|A hypothesis that low temperature acts directly on physiological development of coast fiddleneck (Amsinckia intermedia Fisch. and Mey.) by restricting thiamin content, and limiting growth, was investigated. Restoration of normal growth by application of thiamin, made the plant more susceptible to 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) at low temperatures.
10.2307/4041117|Ethyl N,N-dipropylthiolcarbamate [EPTC] inhibited the deposition of external foliage wax of cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata, L.). Wax inhibition was correlated directly with the rate of application of EPTC. Differential inhibition of wax deposition showed that foliage waxes were important in inhibiting the penetration and absorption of the alkanolamine salts of 4,6-dinitro-o-sec-butylphenol [DNBP]. Several other thiolcarbamates also altered the susceptibility of treated plants to subsequently applied herbicides. When EPTC was applied as a spray, only leaves then in the bud were affected. Leaf primordia developed later were not affected. Granular applications of EPTC extended the period during which the formation of foliage wax was inhibited. The reduction of foliage wax resulted in increased spray retention and decreased contact angle of spray droplets. EPTC increased the transpiration rate proportionally to its rate of application.
10.2307/4041133|A simple, inexpensive soil perfusion unit for use in studying the microbial decomposition of pesticides is described. This unit has the advantage of being equally adaptable to positive or negative pressure systems.
10.2307/4041120| When 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid-1-C (silvex) was applied to Opuntia polyacantha Haw. (prickly pear), pad absorption, root absorption, and translocation were low. The rate of translocation, as measured by acid fuchsin movement, was one cm per hour, about one tenth that found in soybean. Increasing the temperature from 21 to 32 C only slightly increased root absorption and upward translocation of silvex. Pre-treatment of a prickly pear pad, either with a 4% 2,2-dichloropropionic acid solution or mechanical removal of the cuticle, increased the absorption and translocation of subsequently applied silvex. The decarboxylation of silvex was 2 to 3 times greater in soybean than in prickly pear plants. Sixteen days after silvex was applied to prickly pear, four C-metabolites were found in addition to unaltered silvex. 
10.2307/4041132|Aspergillus niger v. T. ATC6275, proliferation was reduced by 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) at 10 and 50 ppm. Picloram (4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid) at rates up to 50 ppm did not reduce fungus growth. A. niger degraded both 2,4-D and picloram, 2,4-D more effectively. Both herbicides were contained in the fungus mycellium.
10.2307/4041125|Opuntia laevis or O. polyacantha (prickly pear) plants exhibited little water loss, exceptional viability, low nutrient requirements for growth, slight photosynthetic activity, slow translocation, and low transpiration rate as compared with corn or soybean plants. The limited number of stomata, thick wax cuticle, and high water binding ability of cell mucilage in prickly pear are largely responsible for the aforementioned physiological characteristics. These studies show that prickly pear pads, which are modified stems, are not efficient organs for metabolic activities. Water extracts of prickly pear tissue applied to corn seeds were found to induce pronounced growth stimulation of corn seedlings.
10.2307/4041124| Carrot (Daucus carota L. var. Imperator) seeds were planted in soil treated with amiben-C at 3 and 6 lb/A. Plants were harvested after 69, 103, and 191 days, autoradiographed or analyzed for the radioactivity in the 80 percent ethanol soluble fraction and in the insoluble fraction. The highest concentration of radioactivity was on or near the surface of the roots, but some radioactivity was present throughout the leaves and roots. The concentration of radioactivity decreased with time both in the soluble fraction and insoluble fraction of the root; in contrast it decreased in the insoluble fraction and increased in the soluble fraction of the leaves. Disks of carrot root were placed in an aerated solution of amiben-C. After 6 days, only 18.7 percent of the amiben remained unaltered. About 4 percent of the radioactivity was released as CO; 64.3 percent was present in an unknown compound which may contain a sugar moiety; the remaining 11.8 percent was distributed among four additional unknown compounds. 
10.2307/4041114|The hypothesis that leaf injury from applications of fenuron (3-phenyl-1,1-dimethylurea) is a direct result of a lack of photosynthate did not explain the results of experiments with seedlings of shrub live oak (Quercus turbinella Greene) supplied with an acorn food reserve supplemented with glucose solution, and with seedlings whose acorns were excised or left attached to the seedlings. An alternate hypothesis is offered: acute leaf injury from phenylurea treatment is due to one or more components of the electron transport chain, between the chlorophyll b pigment system and the reduction of triphosphopyridine nucleotide, which are left in a toxic oxidized state as a result of the phenylurea block in the oxygen-liberating system. Evidence also favors the above interpretation rather than the idea that toxicity results from the accumulation of a toxic oxidized product on the oxygen-liberating pathway. Although leaf injury appears to be due to toxic components of the inhibited photosynthetic apparatus, the ultimate cause of death of the entire plant is starvation. Besides its effect on photosynthesis, fenuron at high concentrations also causes inhibition of root growth.
10.2307/4041135|Seven insecticides were applied separately and in combination with the herbicide propanil (3,4-dichloropropionanilide) to young rice. None of the insecticides applied alone caused leaf burn. Toxaphene and endrin, in combination with propanil, did not increase leaf burn over that which occurred from propanil alone. Malathion, phosphamidon, Guthion (O,O-dimethyl S-4-OxO-1,2,3-benzotriazin-3(4-H)-ylmethyl) phosphorodithioate and Dylox, (O,O-dimethyl 2,2,2-trichloro-1-hydroxyethyl phosphonate) in combination with propanil, increased leaf burn over that which occurred from propanil alone. In general, increased leaf burn resulted in decreased yields of rough rice.
10.2307/4041129| The relationship of atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine) and diuron [3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea] decomposition to microbial activity in two soils was determined. Microbial responses to temperature, added energy material, and time were measured by evolution of CO from herbicide-treated soil samples. Evaluation of herbicide decomposition was made by bioassay and radioassay. Herbicide inactivation was directly related to metabolism of soil organic carbon. Larger amounts of herbicide were inactivated per unit of soil carbon metabolized in Norfolk loamy sand than in Decatur clay loam. This was associated with less soil specific surface and consequently greater concentration of herbicide on soil particle surfaces in Norfolk compared to Decatur soil. Addition of microbial energy sources accelerated decomposition of atrazine and diuron in both soils. Herbicide decomposition was closely associated with repeated additions of energy material, indicating an incidental or nonpreferential involvement in microbial metabolism. Decomposition of atrazine doubled with each 10-degree rise in temperature from 10 to 30 C, paralleling the response of soil organic matter decomposition. Diuron decomposition approximately tripled with each 10-degree rise in temperature. 
10.2307/4041131| Cotton and grain sorghum were treated with directed paraquat (1,1-dimethyl-4,4-dipyridylium cation) sprays in the field. Tall cotton was less susceptible to the herbicide than smaller plants. Some cotton varieties showed greater susceptibility to paraquat than others. In general, fiber quality was not affected by paraquat at 1/8 and 1/4 lb/A, although there was some effect on the fiber coarseness of the more susceptible varieties. Increasing light intensity caused more leaf damage from cotton stem applications of paraquat. Directed paraquat applications invariably caused the outer sorghum leaf sheaths to show necrotic spots where treated. Treatments on 6-inch sorghum reduced yields, but plants treated when taller than 6 inches were not injured. Thirteen sorghum hybrid and open-pollinated varieties showed varying degrees of leaf and sheath burn due to paraquat treatments. 
10.2307/4041130|Where sugar beets followed the year after one year's use of 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine), the carryover, measured by beet response was correlated with the time, the method, and the rate of atrazine used, and the time of plow-down. Where beets were the second crop after an atrazine application, carryover was correlated with the rate of application only. Carryover was greatest following two consecutive years' use of atrazine. Sugar beets were more sensitive to atrazine than were soybeans, navy beans, or oats.
10.2307/4041118| Soil samples were taken from 32 commercial cotton fields of the mid-south which had been treated with one or more practical applications of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron) every year for the past 4 to 8 years. These samples showed no phytotoxic residues in laboratory and greenhouse studies conducted approximately one year after the last application. Cotton seed samples from eight of these fields were analyzed, and none contained a detectable residue of diuron or any of its breakdown products. Diuron degradation in soil under field conditions was demonstrated by isolation and identification of the intermediate breakdown products: 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methylurea, 1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)urea, and 3,4-dichloroaniline. 
10.2307/4041134|A knife injector was designed and tested for the application of ethyl-N,N-dipropylthiolcarbamate (EPTC). Performance was good and preliminary tests were encouraging for both preemergence and postemergence applications.
10.2307/4041127|We developed a technique for obtaining buds which were alike except for the state of dormancy, and measured aerobic respiration and enzyme activities in internally dormant, and active but non-growing, buds of western ironweed (Vernonia baldwini Torr.). In both types of buds respiratory quotient was centered at about 1.2, and slightly higher in the active buds. Respiration rate paralleled specific malic dehydrogenase activity; both were lower in dormant than in active buds. Specific peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase activities did not differ markedly in dormant and in active buds. Respiration rate and all enzyme specific activities increased markedly when active buds were permitted to grow.
10.2307/4041116| The initial and residual toxicities, after 13, 22, and 31 weeks, of dimethyl 2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalate (DCPA), 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron), 3-(hexahydro-4,7-methanoindan-5-yl)-1,1-dimethylurea (norea), 2,4-bis(isopropylamino)-6-methylmercapto-s-triazine (prometryne), and ,,-trifluoro-2,6-dinitro-N,N-dipropyl-p-toluidine (trifluralin) were determined in the greenhouse in four soil types by an oats bioassay. DCPA caused the least oat injury initially, and also after 13 weeks. None of the herbicides persisted in amounts toxic to oats for as long as 22 weeks when applied at concentrations approximately equivalent to field rates necessary for weed control. The residual toxicities of these same herbicides, after 22 weeks or longer, were also determined in Bosket silt loam collected from two depths in two preplanting subsurface and two preemergence surface field experiments by using oats, cotton and/or soybeans as bioassay indicators. Results from field applications at rates recommended for weed control in cotton confirmed that neither DCPA, diuron, norea, nor trifluralin persisted in amounts toxic to oats, soybeans, or cotton; however, prometryne residues were moderately toxic to oats and soybeans. Prometyrne residues from a 4 lb/A non-incorporated subsurface treatment were nearly twice as toxic to oats 25 weeks after application, as were residues from the same amount applied as a surface preemergence treatment. 
10.2307/4041113|Herbicides 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron); 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine); 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine); 2-methoxy-4,6-bis(isopropylamino-s-triazine (prometone); 2-chloro-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (propazine); and 2,4-bis(isopropylamino)-6-methylmercapto-s-triazine (prometryne) were studied in four soils. The behavior of monuron, propazine, atrazine, and simazine was similar in each soil, while prometryne and prometone exhibited greater interactions with the soils. Phytotoxicity and movement of the herbicides in soil were inversely related to extent of adsorption.
10.2307/4041112|Field dodder (Cuscuta campestris Yunck.) emerged as well in total darkness as in light, but seedlings did not twine about the host. Under the shade of alfalfa, dodder emerged normally, but attachment was reduced more than 90% and delayed 7 to 10 days. Attached dodder shaded by alfalfa did not develop its characteristic golden color, grew very slowly, and was delayed in maturity 3 to 4 weeks.
10.2307/4041119| Cotton plants were treated with 2,4-D-2-C- (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) applied with pentachlorophenol and arsenic acid. Seed kernels and regrowth leaves were extracted and various components of the extracts were applied to leaf surfaces and injected into the stems of cotton seedlings. Results indicated that 2,4-D itself and/or a metabolite of 2,4-D, were responsible for the persistence of the 2,4-D stimulus in cotton. 
10.2307/4041128|In the greenhouse, picloram (4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid) prevented germination of side-oats grama [Bouteloua curtipendula (Michx.) Torr.,] big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi Vitman), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and blue grama [Bouteloua gracillis (HBK) Lag.] when applied preemergence. When applied at 1.5 lb/A or more at the two-leaf stage in the greenhouse and field, picloram significantly reduced plant numbers of all species. Of the four species big bluestem appeared to be the most tolerant to picloram in the seedling stages. Germination was reduced when 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) was applied preemergence to side-oats grama and the plant numbers of this species and switchgrass were reduced when treated at the two-leaf stage. The application of picloram to established native range did not reduce forage production or desirable plant frequency. All treatments reduced forb production. Picloram gave very good control of western yarrow (Achillea lanulosa nutt.), white heath aster (Aster ericoides L. nutt.), and western ironweed (Vernonia baldwini Torr.). White sage (Artemisia ludoviciana nutt.) was resistant to 4 lb/A of picloram.
10.2307/4041121|The phytotoxicity from preemergence applications of the herbicides 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine), 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron), isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate (CIPC), 2-chloroallyl diethyldithiocarbamate (CDEC) and 2-chloro-N,N-diallylacetamide (CDAA) was measured at 17 field locations in the coastal plain of North Carolina over three years. Site selections were made with specific regard for soil organic matter, which varied from 0.7 to 48.8 percent. Phytotoxicity responses determined at four to five weeks after treatment were the amounts of herbicide required to cause a 50 percent reduction in (1) soybean dry shoot weight, (2) cotton dry shoot weight and (3) number of weedy annual grasses. Fourteen factors were measured at each location to characterize soil, climatic and biotic factors, and correlated with plant responses obtained. For simazine, diuron and CIPC the factors measured accounted for 60 percent of the plant response variation. The highest simple correlation was usually between soil organic matter and plant response. Phytotoxicity of the aromatic herbicides was inversely correlated with soil organic matter level. CDAA and CDEC usually gave reliable and repeatable performance at constant rates on soils containing between 3 and 40 percent soil organic matter. Below 3 percent soil organic matter, extreme variation in CDAA and CDEC toxicity was encountered.
10.2307/4040971| Some factors affecting the absorption and translocation of radioactive 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) in blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica Muench.) were studied. Absorption of 2,4,5-T was less in plants treated late in the growing season than in those treated earlier. Absorption and translocation of 2,4,5-T were inversely related to soil moisture stress. Increases in the rate of application from 10 to 50 g of 2,4,5-T per plant caused a decrease in absorption and translocation, but decrease of the latter did not occur until the rate was increased above 25 g/plant. Translocation was highest in June and was higher from the leaves of mature plants than from young regrowth. 
10.2307/4040969|The herbicide 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile (dichlobenil) was quite persistent in cranberry bogs. The chemical was not readily leached downward in the soil nor carried from the bog by flood water but was recovered primarily in the upper 4 in of the soil. Chemical residue analysis demonstrated a greater quantity of herbicide was present than indicated by a bio-assay test. Most of the herbicide is believed to be held ineffective by the organic matter in the soil.
10.2307/4040968|The loss of 2-chloroallyl diethyldithiocarbamate (CDEC) from the dry surface of four soils was followed over a 24-hr period by spectrophotometric procedures. As the temperature was increased from 31 C to 44 C and to 54 C, average losses from all soils increased from 33 to 47 to 54%, respectively. There was relatively little difference in rates of loss from the different soils. Loss at 44 C at low (20%) and moderate (65%) relative humidity generally was similar in magnitude. Losses from a wet soil surface at 44 C were much more rapid than from a dry soil.
10.2307/4040977|Seeds of Striga asiatica (L.) Kuntze were induced to germinate with a stimulant from host exudates in the presence of a watersoluble germination inhibitor extracted from Striga seeds. Germination obtained was dependent upon the relative concentrations of stimulant and inhibitor present in the germination medium. The inhibitor had no effect on radical elongation of Striga seeds that germinated in its presence.
10.2307/4040979|A discussion is presented on some mechanisms whereby certain plant growth-regulating materials may exert their activity on plants. A discussion of photosynthesis is developed on the basis of two light reactions being involved in the photosynthetic process. Herbicides which may be active in photosynthesis are considered in relation to their site and mode of action. Current theories of nucleic acid metabolism and protein synthesis are presented and certain inhibitors of these processes are discussed and the possible involvement of plant growth-regulators is considered.
10.2307/4040966|Under light grazing, the reproductive capacity of wild carrot (Daucus carota L.) was reduced, but on pastures under heavy grazing, cattle prevented regrowth and seed production of flowering plants. To simulate the effects of cattle grazing, seedlings and flowering plants were clipped at different times during the summer on natural and experimental plots on different soil textures. Plants on fine textured soils were larger in size, regenerated more rapidly, and had a higher survival rate after clipping. The most efficient time for control by a clipping treatment, determined on the basis of prevention of seed production and mortality of plants, was in the latter part of August.
10.2307/4040978|The maleic hydrazide-30 treated plants increased in protein hydrolysate significantly over the controls, without having any growth. Therefore, this suggests that the synthesis of protein and metabolism of amino acids is not directly related to growth in tea (Camellia sinensis). The inhibitory effects may be due to the lack of synthesis of growth hormones responsible for cell enlargement, or may have a direct effect on the cell wall, reducing the cell plasticity. Hydrolysis with 6N HCl causes a significant destruction of amino acids.
10.2307/4040976|Most of the 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben) absorbed by treated plants was converted to N-glucosyl amiben in the roots. Only small amounts of amiben and N-glucosyl amiben occurred in stems and leaves. The N-glucoside was not metabolized further and remained in vegetative tissue of soybeans for at least 50 days. Soybeans which were depleted of carbohydrate reserves by starvation in the dark absorbed less amiben and produced less N-glucosyl amiben than did plants treated under normal illumination. A similar trend was noted for tomato plants treated in a comparable manner.
10.2307/4040972|Herbicides were evaluated for weed control in seedling perennial grass stands at six locations in eastern Washington. Most annual weeds commonly found in grass seed fields were controlled by 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (dicamba), 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA), and 1-butyl-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methylurea (neburon). Dicamba was the most effective herbicide for annual weed control but caused some injury to Kentucky bluegrass seedlings. Seedling grasses injured by dicamba recovered and became established in each trial. Grasses were injured about the same extent when treated with 2,3,6-TBA as when treated with dicamba, but 2,3,6-TBA did not control as many weed species. Neburon did not control as many species as dicamba and 2,3,6-TBA but was effective in killing a large number of species without measurable injury to grass seedlings.
10.2307/4040974|Gypsophila paniculata L., a dicotyledonous, herbaceous member of the Caryophyllaceae, was introduced into North America from Eurasia as a garden ornamental and has escaped to become troublesome in some areas. A life history study has revealed that this species is spread entirely by seed, its tumbleweed character being an important factor. Germination occurs mainly in the spring in Saskatchewan stands, perhaps as a result of no dormancy in the seeds. Although seedling development is characterized by a rapid penetration of the root system, mortality in natural stands is high. Under favorable conditions, at least 2 yr are required for the production of floral primordia. The mature plant is characterized by a root system which penetrates to depths of 4 meters or more. Shoots arise each year from a thick woody caudex.
10.2307/4040965|When vapor losses of isopropyl N-phenylcarbamate (IPC) and isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamate (CIPC) were studied under controlled laboratory conditions using a direct-trap for vapors, IPC proved more volatile than CIPC. Temperature, air-flow rate, moisture, and cation exchange capacity of soil were important factors influencing volatility. Vapor loss increased with increasing air-flow rate and temperature; losses from moist soil decreased as the percent day, organic matter, or both, and the exchange capacity increased. Vapor losses were negligible from spray applications on dry soil but were sizable from soils at field capacity which were similar to those from soils saturated with moisture. Vapor losses of IPC from granules were much higher than from a surface spray, and CIPC losses were about the same for the granules as from the spray. Covering the soil-applied herbicide with 1/8 to 1/4 in of soil was effective in reducing vapor loss.
10.2307/4040967|The role of corn (Zea mays L.) var. Dixie 18, sorghum (Sorghum vulgare) var. RS 610, and Johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense L.) in dissipation of 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) from Norfolk sandy loam was studied in the field and in a pot-culture experiment in the greenhouse. Atrazine residues were determined by both chemical and bio-assay methods. Corn and Johnsongrass field plots had significantly less atrazine remaining in the 0- to 6-in depth than similarly treated fallow plots 1, 2, 3, and 6 months after planting, and the crops were equally effective in dissipating atrazine from soil. Soil in pots cropped with corn, sorghum, or Johnsongrass had significantly less atrazine remaining than in uncropped pots. Uptake by corn, Johnsongrass, and sorghum within 3 months in the pot-culture experiment accounted for losses of approximately 25, 25, and 20%, respectively, of the herbicide initially present. Bio- and chemical assays were equally sensitive methods of determining atrazine in the soil and gave similar results.
10.2307/4040975|The herbicide 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben) was converted to N-(3-carboxy-2,5-dichlorophenyl)-glucosylamine, N-glucosyl amiben, in roots of plants treated with amiben. Identification of N-glucosyl amiben was accomplished by means of thin-layer and gas chromatography and confirmed by infrared spectroscopy. The postulated metabolite was synthesized and found to be identical with the product of amiben metabolism in plants.
10.2307/4040970|Barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crusgalli (L.) Beauv.) emerged in fields as early as May 3. The shortest period between seeding and emergence and between emergence and tillering was during the warmest period of the growing season. The number of days from emergence to heading and maturity decreased progressively for later seedings. The height of plants was greatest when the plants emerged early in the growing season. The highest number of tiller and heads per tiller were produced by plants emerging in July. Plants which emerged in May and June produced the highest yields. Barnyardgrass seedlings grown under 11-hr photoperiod and 16-hr photoperiod produced mature seeds in 52 and 84 days, respectively. Barnyardgrass grew best under wet soil moisture conditions.
10.2307/4040973|N-1-naphthylthalamic acid (NPA), 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben), and the dimethyl ester of 2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalic acid (DCPA), in granular and liquid or wettable powder formulations, were applied to the soil and then activated by either overhead or sub-irrigation. Granular formulations of the herbicides were as effective as liquid formulations for weed control, providing there was ample moisture for activation. High temperatures and dry soils were conducive to losses by volatilization of NPA. DCPA underwent less loss by volatilization at high temperatures. Both overhead and sub-irrigation were effective in activating these herbicides, but overhead generally was more effective. Under sub-irrigation, use of a granular carrier was more effective with a volatile herbicide. Formulation differences decreased in importance under overhead irrigation. Under conditions of high temperatures and soil moisture, soil persistence of the herbicides varied inversely with their volatility.
10.2307/4040939|Two propagules, axillary tubers of American pondweed and subterranean tubers of floating-leaf pondweed, previously undescribed, are reported. (Results for the first 4 yr of an 8 yr study of the yields of propagules certain aquatic plants grown are reported.) Single propagules of were planted April 1 in California or May 1 in Montana and harvested at the end of the growing season. Two types of propagules were studied, seeds and specialized asexual disseminules. (The latter included subterranean and axillary tubers, axillary buds, and stem segments.) The yields of seeds ranged from 0 with three species to over 2,000,000 with horned pondweed. One culture of sago pondweed formed over 36,000 subterranean tubers. Over 49,000 and 23,000 axillary propagules were produced by leafy and curlyleaf pondweeds, respectively. August, September, and October were the most productive months for the development of propagules. The period varied with each species.
10.2307/4040947|Effects of simazine (2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine) and atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine) were observed when applied in connection with 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole) to citrus trees. The amitrole had no significant effect. In heavy soil, atrazine toxicity to citrus trees was found during the summer following applications after a period of severe hot dry wind. The leaves became bronzed and dried, growth was checked, dry matter, chlorophyll, and catalase activity of leaves reduced, and their peroxidase activity increased when compared with controls from unsprayed plots; ascorbic acid content of leaves also was affected. Simazine, on the contrary, enhanced growth of trees, total and protein nitrogen and chlorophyll in leaves, did not affect peroxidase, catalase or ascorbic acid, and only slightly depressed dry matter content. In a light soil, probably due to less residual triazines, no toxic effects were observed and untreated controls evinced less growth, lower chlorophyll and nitrogen content of leaves, and higher peroxidase activity than all triazine treatments.
10.2307/4040956|Although selectivity was low, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron) gave excellent preemergence weed control when castorbeans (Ricinus communis L.) were planted 2 or 3 in deep. Excellent weed control with little crop injury by 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben) was provided also and selectivity was not affected by depth of planting.
10.2307/4040957|Average monthly rooting of saltcedar (Tamarix pentandra Pall.) stem cuttings collected weekly for a year and planted on a mist-bed was 96-100% from early February through May and decreased to 77% in November. Accompanying shoot formation reached a concurrent maximum of 96-100%, with an October low of 10%. Bud dormancy of October-November cuttings was reduced by cold treatment, but June-July cuttings were not responsive. A rooting compound reduced shoot and root formation.
10.2307/4040959| The pre- and postemergence herbicidal activities and specifications of 16 substituted toluidines on eight species were determined at two application rates. CF-analogs were more active as preemergence treatments, and CH-analogs were more active as postemergence treatments. Preemergence toxicity to crops was decreased in the CF and CH series when the N-substituents contained more than six carbons. 
10.2307/4040938| Adsorption of 1-butyl-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methylurea (neburon), determined spectrophotometrically, varied considerably among representative soils of six Hawaiian great soil groups, ranging from 29% in Lualualei soil to 94% in Honouliuli soil. The adsorption of neburon was strongly correlated with organic matter and total soil nitrogen; other soil properties were not related. Initial and residual neburon phytotoxicity to oats in the greenhouse was dependent on total soil nitrogen, organic matter, and the degree of neburon adsorption. Based on ED values, neburon toxicity in soil types decreased in the following order: Lualualei, Wahiawa, Mahana, Paaloa, Waimanalo, Kapaa, and Honouliuli. Complete neburon inactivation was obtained in Honouliuli and Waimanalo soils within the 150-day duration of this experiment, and nearly complete inactivation in Mahana and Kapaa soils. 
10.2307/4040946| Foliar absorption of carboxyl-labeled 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) by mesquite [Prosopis juliflora var. glandulosa (Torr.) Cockerel] seedlings was continuous throughout a 72-hr period. Approximately 50% of the 2,4,5-T applied to a single leaf was absorbed when 5 to 100 g were applied. No significant differences were found in the amounts of 2,4,5-T absorbed at 70 and 85 F, but an increase occurred at 100 F after 72 hr. Only slight differences in absorption were found at different humidity levels. Translocation was primarily basipetal from the point of application at 70 F, both acropetal and basipetal at 85 F, and only a short distance acropetal at 100 F. The quantities of 2,4,5-T translocated into untreated tissues at 100 F were less than at 70 and 85 F. The highest concentrations of 2,4,5-T were found in tissues with highest soluble sugar concentrations. From 3 to 27% of the 2,4,5-T absorbed by mesquite leaves was subsequently detected in untreated stem, leaf, and root tissues. Approximately 80% of the 2,4,5-T absorbed by mesquite leaves was metabolized after 24 hr. Moving the seedlings to a different environment at the time of treatment increased the rate of 2,4,5-T metabolism. Metabolism of 2,4,5-T was completely inhibited at 50 F and a lower rate of metabolism was noted at 100 than at 70 and 85 F. No important differences in metabolism were found at different humidity levels. 
10.2307/4040943| The relationship between susceptibility of certain plant species to 4,6-dinitro-o-sec-butylphenol (DNBP) and their capacity to accumulate externally supplied P, and to form ATP in leaf disks was studied. A correlation was found between susceptibility of the species to DNBP and their capacity for P accumulation and ATP synthesis. Therefore, it was postulated that susceptibility depends upon the level of ATP in the tissues. 
10.2307/4040952|Crabgrass (Digitaria spp.) control by different herbicides in field experiments varied from 84 to 100%. These extremes were not significantly different. Greenhouse studies showed that increased moisture content in soils may increase the growth rate of crabgrass seedlings so that they may escape herbicidal injury. Effects of herbicides on root stunting were similar in both dry and wet soils, indicating immobility of the herbicides under these experimental conditions. Competition between mature bluegrass plants and crabgrass seedlings was an important determinant of effective crabgrass control with preemergence herbicides.
10.2307/4040941|A technique was developed for the bioassay in 48 to 84 hours of herbicides in soil or of herbicidal solutions applied to sand. Sorghum seedlings are grown against the lids of petri dishes which are filled with a moistened sand or soil medium. A modification of this technique allows the assessment of the relative importance of uptake by the root and the shoot of a range of herbicides incorporated in sand or soil. Ethyl N,N-dipropylthiolcarbamate (EPTC), 2,3-dichloroallyl N,N-diisopropylthiolcarbamate (diallate), 2-chloroallyl-N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate (CDEC), and possibly 2-chloro-N,N-diallylacetamide (CDAA) are dependent on uptake via the shoot prior to emergence for their characteristic toxic effects. Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate (CIPC), 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile (dichlobenil), and 2,6-dinitro-N,N-dipropyl-4-trifluoromethylaniline (trifluralin) can exert their action through direct uptake by the shoot, but root uptake appears to be much more effective. A number of other compounds appear to be ineffective when uptake is via the shoot from moistened sand.
10.2307/4040955|A microcoulometric gas chromatographic method with a sensitivity of 0.01 ppm is described for the analysis of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) in milk and forage. The method will analyze 2,4-D as the acid, ester, and bound form from a single sample. Results show the superiority of this method over previous procedures. The formation of 2,4-D ethyl ester from the butyl ester in forage is discussed.
10.2307/4040950|Sesbania (Sesbania exaltata (Raf.) Cory) in soybeans was effectively controlled with wax bars containing 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). Bars, 22 in long, were attached horizontally 3 in apart to a tractor-mounted boom and the height was adjusted for it to travel 2 to 3 in above crop plants. Six-pound bars, containing 1 lb of 2,4-D gave better control than bars containing less 2,4-D. Bars made of wax with a melting point of 170 F provided more economical control than bars with waxes of lower melting points. Rate application of wax increased with the size of the weeds treated and with reduced tractor speed. Treatments controlled sesbania without visible injury to soybeans.
10.2307/4040949|Addition of organic matter reduced the effectiveness of 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) to oats in Regina heavy clay soil. At high moisture levels, changes in the relative amounts of clay in the soil did not affect the toxicity of simazine. Toxicity of simazine decreased as the soil moisture level was reduced.
10.2307/4040948|Cotton seedlings emerged normally following applications of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron) before or after furrowing for the preplating irrigation, but 7 to 10 days after emergence stands were sometimes reduced when diuron was applied before furrowing. Stand reductions were most severe when cottonseed were planted at or above the layer of diuron-treated soil. Cotton varieties differed in tolerance to diuron. Preplanting applications controlled annual weeds until mid-season and treated cotton produced normal yields, except where stands were reduced. Fiber properties and boll components of treated cotton were not altered. Content of diuron was highest in young cotton plants. No diuron was found in cottonseed at harvest using an analytical procedure having a sensitivity of 0.1 ppm.
10.2307/4040945| The compounds 3-(p-chlorophenyl-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron), 5-bromo-3-sec-butyl-6-methyluracil (bromacil), 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine), 2-chloro-4,6-bis (ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine), 1,1-dimethyl-4,4-dipyridylium salt (paraquat), and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole) were added to a complete nutrient medium on which chlorotic Nicotiana tobacum was grown in the dark. Herbicide concentrations generally were 0, 10, 10, 10, and 10 molar. Callus growth was inhibited by molar concentrations greater than 10 for the triazines, 10 for monuron, 10 for bromacil, 10 for paraquat and amitrole. At these concentrations, interference with a mechanism other than photosynthesis was responsible for inhibition of growth. 
10.2307/4040954|Low-volatile and high-volatile esters of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) were sprayed on separate pastures at about double the usual rate. Milk from cows grazing these pastures contained from 0.01 to 0.09 ppm 2,4-D during the first 2 days after spraying and lower amounts thereafter. Residues in milk from cows put into the pastures 4 days after spraying were below 0.01 ppm, the practical limit of precision of the method used. Residues of 2,4-D, in or on forage, declined rapidly during the experiment. Almost all the 2,4-D in or on forage was hydrolyzed to the acid form in samples of forage taken within one-half hour after spraying with the butyl ester of 2,4-D, and about 75% after applying the 2-ethylhexyl ester.
10.2307/4040960| Gross autoradiography showed that translocation of C-labeled 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole) from the leaf of quackgrass (Agropyron repens (L.) Beauv.) was retarded over 12 hr by ammonium thiocyanate applied as a spray or as a spot. While considerable export of C from the treated leaf occurred during 12, 24, and 96 hr after C-amitrole was applied, C-NHSCN as a tracer was largely restricted to the treated leaf over the first 24 hr and showed only slight export over 96 hr. It was concluded that the synergistic effect of NHSCN on amitrole is exerted in the treated areas and not at the ultimate site of amitrole action. 
10.2307/4040940|A Whirljet nozzle and a flat, fan-type nozzle produced similar spray patterns when used for aerial spraying so that no reduction in drift could be obtained by the use of either nozzle. Wind speeds of 3 to 4 mph caused drift more than 80 ft to the leeward of the flight line with both nozzles.
10.2307/4040951|The ultraviolet absorption spectra of aqueous dispersions of 2-chloroallyl diethyldithiocarbamate (CDEC) were altered by relatively short periods of exposure to far ultraviolet radiation. Evidence of molecular decomposition also was obtained from solvent partitioning characteristics, gas chromatography, and bioassays. Ultraviolet irradiation of soil surfaces treated with the herbicide decreased its persistence, but no evidence of decomposition was obtained.
10.2307/4040953|A chromatographic procedure for detecting 4-amino-3,5,6-tricholorpicolinic acid (picloram) residue to a sensitivity of approximately 0.05 ppm in soils is described. Picloram is extracted from soil as the free acid and methylated with boron trifluridemethanol reagent. Data indicate that the amount of herbicide which actually reaches the soil may only be 10% of that applied to dense stands of oak. Rainfall was an important factor in determining the movement and persistence of picloram. Picloram was detected to a depth of 24 in within 6 weeks after application. No detectable residues were found in the upper 24 in of soil after one year with rates as high as 8 lb/A.
10.2307/4040958| Propionate, 3-chloropropionate, and 2,2-dichloropropionate (dalapon) inhibited growth of Escherichia coli 99-4, a mutant organism incapable of growth in the absence of -ketopantoate. Growth inhibitions were circumvented by increasing the concentration of ketopantoate. Aliphatic acids (K salts) apparently inhibit biosynthesis of pantothenate at two metabolic sites-conversion of ketopantoate to pantoate and formation of pantothenate from pantoate. The latter inhibition has been reported previously. 
10.2307/4040944|In soil enrichment studies, the microbial degradation of 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon) was inhibited in the presence of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole), but dalapon had little or no effect on behavior of amitrole. Phytotoxic residues of the herbicides persisted longer in soils when the herbicides were applied in combination than when each was used individually. Although amitrole disappeared rapidly from all amitrole-treated soils, dalapon, when applied in combination with amitrole, disappeared more slowly than when used alone. Dalapon did not affect the behavior of amitrole in muck soil, but affected the availability of amitrole in Hagerstown silty clay loam treated with high rates of amitrole.
10.2307/4040937|Plots in dense quackgrass (Agropyron repens) sods were treated with 5-bromo-3-isopropyl-6-methyl uracil (isocil) or 5-bromo-3-sec-butyl-6-methyl uracil (bromacil) at rates of 0.5 to 4.0 lb/A in the fall or in the early spring and then planted to corn. Quackgrass was virtually eliminated by all rates but 0.5 lb/A. Corn was severely injured on plots treated at 2 lb/A but made fair growth at rates of 1.0 lb/A or less. The year following corn, soil residues of isocil were more toxic to oats than those of bromacil. Carbohydrate analyses of rhizomes from treated plots indicated that depletion of carbohydrate reserves contributed to the elimination of the quackgrass.
10.2307/4040942|In studies of the effect of root temperature on the toxicity of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) to rubber rabbit-brush (Chrysothamnus nauseosus (Pall.) Britton), 75 F resulted in the highest mortality following 2,4-D treatment. Root temperatures had no effect on leaf cuticle thickness. In similar studies with Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense (L) Scop.) and Russian knapweed (Centaurea repens L.), little injury resulted from 2,4-D treatment at 45 F whereas at 90 F in Canada thistle and at 60, 75, and 90 F in Russian knapweed, severe injury and/or death resulted.
10.2307/4040915| Detoxication of 3,6-dichloro-o-anisic acid (dicamba) in incubated soils was greater in heavier soil types and soils with higher moisture contents and higher temperatures. Dicamba phytotoxicity was less at 21 C than at 27 or 32 C. Over a pH range of 4.1 to 9.4, dicamba had a net negative charge. Dicamba showed considerable adsorption onto a kaolinite clay but little adsorption onto other clays and soils studied. Dicamba-1-C mixed with autoclaved Sharpsburg silty clay loam soil and incubated at 0, 33, 75, and 100% relative humidity and 35 C sustained very little volatilization loss over an 8-week period. However, nearly one-half of the radioactivity of dicamba-1-C on bare planchets at 0 and 100% relative humidity and 35 C was lost during an 11-week incubation period. 
10.2307/4040917|The loss of 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron) and 1-butyl-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methylurea (neburon) from an aquatic situation was studied. Appreciable loss of herbicides did not occur until 8 and 16 weeks after application of neburon and monuron, respectively. Periods of loss at an accelerated rate followed until approximately 50% of the herbicides disappeared. Further loss was observed but at a steadily decreasing rate. Approximately 15% of the monuron and 39% of the neburon remained after 128 weeks. More monuron was found in water than in soil during the first 32 weeks. After 32 weeks, most of the monuron was found in the soil and was largely in the top 4 in. The largest fraction of neburon was recovered from the soil and soil surface during all 128 weeks. Monuron moved down in the soil more readily than neburon.
10.2307/4040918| Among 12 of the more effective surfactants selected from a preliminary experiment, there were few differences in their ability to increase atrazine toxicity to large crabgrass [Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop.] and sorghum (Sorghum vulgare Pers.), or in toxicity to large crabgrass and sorghum when used alone. Surfactants per se showed some toxicity to large crabgrass and sorghum. As large crabgrass increased in size, it became less susceptible to injury from atrazine plus dodecyl ether of polyethylene glycol (Surfactant WK). Early spraying with atrazine plus Surfactant WK reduced the top-growth yield of six grass species. In field studies, atrazine alone and surfactants plus atrazine applied at the 1-in weed height gave very good early weed control. Field plots treated at the 4-in weed height generally produced more weed top-growth and less sorghum than plots treated at the 1-in height. Only the preemergence atrazine treatments gave weed yields that were equal to treatments that included handweeding. Sorghum injury from the surfactants was evidenced by reduced stover yields. Atrazine plus surfactant toxicity to emerged large crabgrass, grown in growth chambers, increased with higher relative humidities. This was not true for sorghum. The 1% surfactant mixtures generally had a lower surface tension than the 0.1% concentrations although the differences were not great. Surface tension was not the main factor governing the phytotoxicity of foliar-applied atrazine solutions. Translocation of atrazine from sorghum and large crabgrass leaves dipped in a C-ring-labeled atrazine solution was very slight or nonexistent. 
10.2307/4040924|Surface applications of 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram) were made at 5 rates on 3 soil types. The picloram-treated areas were sampled 3 times after herbicidal application to determine the extent and movement of herbicide residues. The region of highest picloram concentration in a heavy- and medium-textured soil, when sampled 9 and 15 months after application, was near the surface. On the light-textured soil, picloram moved more completely through the surface 2 ft of soil with greatest herbicide concentrations generally found at the deepest sampling depth. Applications of picloram were dissipated faster at low rather than at high rates on all 3 soil types. Concentrations of phytotoxic residues at the end of the study period were greatest in the heavy-textured soil with the highest organic content.
10.2307/4040934|In 1963 and 1964, a study was conducted near Bernardo, New Mexico, on control of saltcedar (Tamarix pentandra Pall.), comparing single and combination mowing and spraying with the propylene glycol butyl ether (PGBE) ester of 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy) propionic acid (silvex), repeated spray applications of silvex, and single applications of mixtures of silvex and 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram). None of the mow-spray combinations initiated in 1963 reduced the stand of saltcedar more than 8%, and there were no significant differences between treatments. A follow-up spray treatment of 4 lb/A of silvex in 1964 increased the plant kill up to 60%. Spraying undisturbed saltcedar in June, 1964, and re-spraying in August with 2 lb/A of silvex, reduced the saltcedar approximately 40%, as did a single application of a mixture of 2 lb/A of silvex and 2 lb/A of picloram in June.
10.2307/4040910|Dimethyl sulfoxide, soil-incorporated at rates of 20 to 240 gpa, prevented the growth of roots and delayed and inhibited the growth of shoots of plants developing from purple nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus L.) tubers for a period of about two months. This effect upon growth occurred only while the tubers and developing plants remained in treated soil; transplanted to untreated soil, subsequent growth of roots and shoots was immediate and normal. The effective soil-residual life of dimethyl sulfoxide was about three months, irrespective of dosage. Dosages of 2 1/2 to 7 1/2 gpa had no effect upon the growth of the nutsedge plants. At 10 and 15 gpa, the inhibitory effect of dimethyl sulfoxide becomes apparent.
10.2307/4040933|The effectiveness of catch or trap crops in ridding soil of witchweed was studied by growing the crops 1 through 5 years on heavily infested witchweed land. Catch or trap crops were about equal in value for witchweed eradication. Soybeans, field peas, and sorghum were grown 3 years before acceptable corn yields were obtained. Two years of millet and 4 of corn were required to obtain acceptable corn yields. Complete eradication of witchweed was not achieved by any crop during the 5-year period.
10.2307/4040911| Following root application of a selective rate of 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid-C (amiben-C), the translocation of radioactivity from roots to shoots was greater in pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), a susceptible plant, than in soybeans, a resistant one. Most of the radioactivity extracted from soybean and pigweed plants was present as conjugates of amiben-C. The conjugate extracted from soybean was chromatographically identical with an N-glycoside prepared from glucose and amiben. In soybean plants, 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid also was converted to N-glycosylamiben. 
10.2307/4040929|The relative tolerance of one-year-old peach and apricot seedlings to 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) and 2-methoxy-4,6-bis = (isopropylamino)-s-triazine prometryne was established by soil surface and soil incorporated applications. In all cases, the relative tolerance to both herbicides was greater for peach than apricot. Reciprocal grafts of peach and apricot budded seedlings indicated that the rootstock did not alter the tolerance. The greater tolerance of peach over that of apricot was attributed to physiological detoxification occurring in the scion.
10.2307/4040908|Foliar applications of the dimethylamine salt of 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)butyric acid (2,4-DB) were effective for controlling cocklebur in soybeans. Treatments usually caused crop injury, but treated soybeans often produced higher seed yields than untreated soybeans heavily infested with cocklebur plants. Soybean injury was associated with the mechanical shielding of soybeans by the cocklebur infestation and soil moisture stress at time of treatment. Droughty conditions prior to treatment intensified crop injury and reduced soybeans yields.
10.2307/4040925| Two-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine), 5-bromo-3-sec-butyl-6-methyluracil (bromacil), and 6,7-dihydrodipyrido-(1,2-a:2,1-c)-pyrazidiinium salt (diquat) significantly inhibited photosynthetic CO-fixation to varying degrees in corn (Zea mays L., var. Dixie 18), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L., var. Deltapine), and soybeans (Glycine max (L.) Merr., var. Lee). Atrazine treatments of 10 ppm overloaded the protective mechanisms in corn and cotton. Both 1 and 10 ppm of atrazine reduced CO-fixation to less than 5% of controls in soybeans, a sensitive species. One ppm of bromacil and of diquat reduced CO-fixation in all three crops, but diquat was less inhibitory than either bromacil or atrazine. Except for diquat on corn, herbicides had no significant effect on CO-fixation in the dark. Treatments in which photosynthetic CO-fixation was 5% or more of controls had little effect on the kinds or relative amounts of C-labeled compounds produced. Only the total amount fixed was reduced. Treatments, in which photosynthetic CO-fixation was less than 5% of controls, caused a significant reduction in the relative amounts of sucrose and alanine produced; however, the relative amounts of malic, aspartic, and glutamic acids increased. 
10.2307/4040926|In the greenhouse, 20% granular isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate (CIPC) at 6 lb/A provided 100% dodder control for 3 to 6 weeks. In the field, 95 to 100% control persisted beyond the expected soil life of CIPC because shade from the crop plants inhibited dodder development and dry soil reduced dodder germination. Effective control required uniform distribution on the soil before the dodder was wrapped on the host plant. CIPC was most effective when applied on the soil surface; incorporation 1/2, 1 1/2, or 3 in deep reduced its effectiveness. It controlled dodder well if applied to moist soil but was less effective when the soil surface was dry. Partial shade from the crop at the time of application increased the effectiveness of CIPC. Under certain undefined conditions, CIPC applied to the soil injured attached dodder. However, it was consistently effective only on dodder seedlings before attachment.
10.2307/4040913|Non-lethal dosages of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), which stunted pigweed plants, markedly reduced transpiration. Lethal dosages of 2,4-D, 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon), or toxic oil reduced transpiration rapidly, but transpiration continued until treated plants were air dry. Large plants died slower than small plants after herbicide treatment; consequently, they transpired more water before death.
10.2307/4040923| New Line Early Perfection peas (Pisum sativum L.) in the 10th-node stage were treated with a foliar broadcast application of 1 lb/A of the sodium salt of carboxyl carbon-14 labeled 4-(2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxy) butyric acid (MCPB*). Direct counting of C indicated that MCPB* equivalent to 8.4 ppm on the fresh weight basis was in or on the pea tissue immediately after treatment. The concentration declined rapidly for 6 days following treatment and then at a reduced rate until shelled pea harvest 5 weeks later. Translocation of C was studied by autoradiography. Most of the labeled material was retained at the application site. Very little was translocated to the new growth or into the pea seed. The plants retained C equivalent to 0.4 ppm MCPB* at the time of harvest with a concentration in the shelled peas of not more than 0.1 ppm. 
10.2307/4040914|The response of four growth stages of Setaria glauca (L.) Beauv. (yellow foxtail), Eleusine indica (L.) Gaertn. (goosegrass), and Dactyloctenium aegyptium (L.) Richt (crowfootgrass) to dimethylarsinic acid (cacodylic acid) applied at rates of 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 lb/A was studied. The four growth stages for chemical treatments were generally: (a) early tillering, (b) late tillering, (c) boot, and (d) post-heading. Seed production was reduced by as much as 96% in yellow foxtail, 80% in goosegrass, and 37% in crowfootgrass. Application of the chemical at the "boot" stage was most effective although earlier applications also were effective. Inflorescences often were malformed. Other growth effects suggested a growth regulator type activity.
10.2307/4040909|Applications of disodium methanearsonate (DSMA) killed Johnsongrass foliage in field and greenhouse experiments. Control of regrowth following treatment increased with increasing rates, but there was no indication of translocation to rhizomes. DSMA toxicity did not change in 20 to 80 gpa water, but somewhat less control was obtained in 10 gpa. Addition of a surfactant to spray solutions increased toxicity. Control was not affected by stage of Johnsongrass growth, but observations indicated increased control during droughty conditions. Repeated usage provided seasonal Johnsongrass control equal to that obtained with sodium 2,2-dichloropropionate (dalapon), although more frequent applications were necessary.
10.2307/4040928|Tubers of sago pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus L.) were grown at 72 F in a 14-hr photoperiod under 400 ft-c of cool-white fluorescent illumination. Plants were randomly harvested each day for 30 days, the organs individually weighed, and carbohydrate determinations made on selected tissues. Unsprouted tubers averaged 19.5% dry weight of which 74% was carbohydrate, predominantly in non-extractable form. During growth, the carbohydrate supply in the tubers decreased logarithmically by 1/2 each 4.93 days. Shoots began to grow logarithmically at 11 days, doubling in dry weight each 4.5 days. After 18 days, the carbohydrate content of the main shoot increased logarithmically, doubling each 7.35 days. Plants produced from average tubers increased 7-fold in dry weight in 30 days. Growth analysis showed that no shoots became self-sufficient before 16 days. Deduced patterns of carbohydrate flow are correlated with reports of herbicidal effectiveness.
10.2307/4040931|Mathematical relationships are developed for a general system in which the concentrate chamber and diluent vessel contain the active material to be evaluated. The use of the system for increasing the effective half-dosage distance is illustrated. A technique is described for decreasing the half-dosage distance with a conventional system.
10.2307/4040932|Using previously published data, a quantitative treatment of the influence of soil moisture content on herbicidal activity has been described. The treatment is based upon the use of the distribution coefficient,
10.2307/4040922| The effect of ultraviolet (UV) light (240-260 m range) on 6, 7-dihydrodipyrido (1, 2-a:2,1-c)-pyrazidiinium salt (diquat) and 1,1-dimethyl-4,4-bipyridinium salt (paraquat) was studied. Both dipyridyls were very stable in dark but were altered rapidly in the presence of UV light. Radioassay data collected from planchets containing solidified diquat or paraquat indicated a loss of more than 50% of the C from both compounds after 48 hr and more than 75% after 96 hr. When radioactive aqueous solutions were placed under UV lights, little change in the radioactivity occurred during an 8-day period as determined by liquid scintillation. When the concentration of diquat or paraquat in these solutions was determined by chemical analysis, degradation of the original molecules was observed. Information obtained by autoradiography of chromatograms, spotted with radioactive aqueous solutions exposed to UV light, indicated that two or possibly more C-containing degradation products were formed from both diquat and paraquat. Co-chromatography indicated that one degradation product from paraquat was 1-methyl-4-carboxy-pyridinium ion. 
10.2307/4040927| A study was made with glucose-l-C, glucose-6-C, and glucose U-C to determine quantitatively the effects of 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon) on glucose utilization in roots and shoots of one-week-old barley seedlings. An attempt also was made to determine the major pathway of glucose metabolism involved. Dalapon apparently did not change the normal pathway of glucose metabolism but interferred with glucose utilization as evidenced by differences in radioactivity of sugars and organic acids. Partial blocks may be operative initially at the beginning of the glycolytic pathway and subsequently in the Krebs cycle. 
10.2307/4040916|Glasshouse and field experiments were conducted on fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, and clay to study under high temperatures 2-chloroallyl diethyldithiocarbamate (CDEC) and ethyl N,N-dipropylthiolcarbamate (EPTC) incorporated with the surface 1/2, 1, 2, and 3 in of soil and unincorporated. Herbicides, sprayed on the soil surface, were incorporated either manually in the glasshouse or with a powered, rotary tiller in the field. The principal weed species were Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. Wats.), redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), junglerice (Echinochloa colonum (L.) Link), and barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crusgalli (L.) Beauv.). Performances of herbicides were determined by counting the plants 2 weeks after treatment. The herbicidal performance of CDEC was greater when the applications were incorporated with the surface 1/2 or 1 in whereas the performance of EPTC increased with increasing depths of incorporation up to 3 in. Soil temperature, soil moisture losses, and the distribution of herbicide in soil apparently contributed to differential herbicide performance.
10.2307/4040920|Plots infested with quackgrass (Agropyron repens (L.) Beauv.) were treated with 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropyl-s-triazine (atrazine) at several rates at various times and subjected to a number of cultural and cropping treatments. Depletion of carbohydrate reserves in the rhizomes increased with time after treatment. Recovery of the quackgrass occurred after 2 lb/A but usually not after 4 lb/A applications. Applications of nitrogen increased the rate of carbohydrate depletion. Two applications of atrazine at reduced rates were equal or superior to a single heavy rate. Tillage after treatment and crop competition improved the control of quackgrass obtained.
10.2307/4040919|The tolerances of wheat and wild buckwheat (Polygonum convolvulus) to various rates of 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (dicamba) were determined under field conditions and supplemented by studies with wheat in the growth chamber. Wheat height and yield were inversely proportional to rate, but response to various rates was dependent on stage of growth at application. Greatest reductions in wheat height and yield resulted from treatment at the late tiller and boot stages, respectively. The weight per 100 wheat seeds was increased from treatment at the boot and flower stages but was decreased at the early tiller stage. The ratio of peduncle length:length of the flag leaf-sheath was decreased most from 24 oz/A applied preemergence and 12 oz/A applied at the late tiller stage. Growth rate of wheat was decreased for a 2-week period after treatment. Excellent kill of wild buckwheat was observed from all rates applied through the 12- to 15-leaf stage of growth.
10.2307/4040921|The adsorption and desorption of 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropyl-amino-s-triazine (atrazine) as affected by pH, temperature, and cencentration of atrazine were studied on Drummer clay loam soil and a humic acid isolated from Leonardite. The adsorption of atrazine on the soil increased as pH decreased, but it was affected only slightly by temperature and cencentration of atrazine. Desorption of atrazine was greater with increasing temperature and pH. The adsorption of atrazine on the soil was reversible and desorption was nearly complete. Adsorption of atrazine on the humic acid increased as pH decreased and temperature increased, and there was very little desorption of atrazine from the humic acid.
10.2307/4040930|A low-volume, transparent, acrylic plastic concentrate tank for herbicide spray solutions is described which includes a fast-opening filler valve, a pressure relief valve, and a compressed air intake.
10.2307/4040912|Germination of wild carrot (Daucus carota L.) was not confined to any season but was correlated with abundant soil moisture in field studies. In laboratory studies, germination percentage for any seed lot increased with time as dormancy was overcome. Further, the germination was not clearly correlated with seed weight, light, or pH, but temperature and the availability of water were clearly significant. Dormancy was due to the endosperm which surrounds the embryo. When part of the endosperm covering the tip of the radicle was digested or broken off, germination was increased nearly to the potential for a given lot of seed.
10.2307/4041059|Two morphological types of tubers of yellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus L.) were collected over a 2-year period and were sprouted in the laboratory. Tuber dormancy occurred during late summer and early fall. Sprouting was highest during the winter and spring. Mechanical disturbance of the nutsedge stand increased tuber sprouting. Available carbohydrates followed a pattern similar to sprouting; minimum levels were found during late summer. The two types of tubers appeared to be similar in respect to the characteristics studied.
10.2307/4041061|Two fish from South America. (Metynnis roosevelti Eigenmann and Mylossoma argenteum E. Ahl.), both called silver dollar fish, grazed rapidly on several species of submersed aquatic weeds. Horned pondweed (Zannichellia palustris L.), American pondweed (Potamogeton nodosus Poir.), and sago pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus L.) were most palatable to the fish. Richardson pondweed (Potamogeton richardsonii (Ar. Benn.) Rydb.), curlyleaf pondweed (Potamogeton crispus L.), and American elodea (Elodea canadensis Michx.) also were grazed. The fish readily grazed on shoots of all sizes except those of mature plants. The Mylossoma grazed the plants more rapidly than the Metynnis. When water temperatures were above 70 F, the fish became more active in their feeding habits.
10.2307/4041055|Gas chromatographic and thermoelectric methods were combined in a quantitative study of absorption and movement of 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) in bean plants in various intensities of moisture stress. Foliar absorption of the herbicides studies was unaffected by extreme moisture stress. Herbicidal movement in the plant was markedly reduced, however. Distribution patterns were affected only when stress was permitted to progress to the wilting point. Picloram was more mobile than 2,4,5-T at all stresses.
10.2307/4041076|The herbicide 0-(2,4-dichlorophenyl) 0-methyl isopropylphosphoramidothioate (DMPA) applied either as a preemergence spray or in mixture with the alkanolamine salt of 4,6-dinitro-orthosec-butylphenol (DNBP) at the "ground-cracking" (emergent) stage increased the yield of peanuts from 1960 to 1965. Average yield increases from DMPA treatments for the 5-year period were highly significant statistically if DMPA treated peanuts were compared with peanuts either cultivated, handweeded, or sprayed with standard herbicide mixtures.
10.2307/4041078| Four new biodegradable alkylpolyoxyethylene glycol surfactants (15-S-9, DN-65, 15-S-3, and 15-S-3A) provided excellent visual wetting of corn foliage in spray solutions of 1,1-dimethyl-4,4-bipyridinium salt (paraquat), 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon), and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole) and many combinations were equal or superior to standard surfactants Tween 20, X-77, and Osamul 95 in enhancing phytotoxicity. Exceptions were observed, apparently due to specific but incompletely understood herbicide-surfactant-plant surface interactions. All four biodegradable surfactants and Osamul 95 were slightly toxic when sprayed alone on corn foliage. 
10.2307/4041060|Heights of corn and giant foxtail (Setaria faberii Hermm.) were measured during 1963, 1964, and 1965 in east-central Illinois to establish guidelines for postemergence control of this weed in corn. With an average planting date of May 9, corn grew to a height of 6 in and foxtail 2 in by May 28. With corn growing at a daily rate of 1 in and foxtail 1/2 in from June 5 to 20, foxtail height was 40 to 45% that of corn.
10.2307/4041067| Methods of weed control and seeding of perennial grasses on rangelands infested with downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.) in Nevada and northeastern California were compared for 4 years. In this study, 1, 1-dimethyl-4,4-bipyridinium salt (paraquat) at 0.5 lb/A and higher gave adequate and consistent control of downy brome for establishment of perennial grasses. Disking gave weed control and perennial grass establishment generally comparable to that of paraquat. Weed control from furrowing alone usually was not adequate for establishment of good stands. Seeding in furrows combined with paraquat spraying or disking gave best seedling establishment. Establishment of intermediate or pubescent wheatgrass (Agropyron intermedium (Host) Beauv. and A. trichophorum (Link) Richt.) was better than crested wheatgrass (A. desertorum (Fisch.) Schult.). Precipitation in different years, site potential, and weed population at different locations influenced weed control and establishment of perennial grasses. 
10.2307/4041057|The use of preplow foliar application of 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon) for two seasons, a pre-emergence soil incorporated treatment of ethyl N,N-dipropylthiocarbamate (EPTC) for three seasons, and tillage during all 3 years was effective in the control of Johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers.) while corn was being produced on the land. The use of tillage alone, dalapon plus tillage, or EPTC plus tillage resulted in neither satisfactory Johnsongrass control nor corn yield. Dalapon plus tillage reduced the rhizomatous Johnsongrass population and increased corn yield the season following preplow treatments; reinfestation occurred, however, from Johnsongrass seedlings that emerged in the row after the corn was planted. EPTC afforded early season control of seedling Johnsongrass. EPTC plus tillage did not satisfactorily control Johnsongrass or increase corn yield over tillage alone. Injury to corn planted 1 in deep was noted in the first season's treatments; however, corn planted 1 1/2 in deep in subsequent years was not affected.
10.2307/4041063|Methods of extraction, cleanup, and determination of 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) residues from soil were studied. Two-hr soxhlet extraction with methanol was more efficient than shaking extraction with methanol or other solvents. The most successful cleanup method was the use of grade IV basic alumina columns. Polyethylene coated alumina columns were useful if the soil extracts contained high amounts of pigments. A pyridine-alkali-ethylcyanoacetate method of determination was more sensitive and had better color stability than the pyridine-alkali method. Another advantage of the method with ethylcyanoacetate was that a pink chromophore was determined rather than a yellow chromophore which is subject to high interference from yellow pigments from soil extracts.
10.2307/4041072|Three facets of the phytotoxicity of disodium methanearsonate (DSMA) incorporated in soils were studied in seven greenhouse experiments. Growth of cotton planted immediately after incorporation of DSMA in Bosket silt loam was reduced significantly by herbicide concentrations of 50 to 80 ppmw. Toxicity appeared to decrease with time, particularly during the first 16 weeks after incorporation. DSMA incorporated in Bosket silt loam at 120 ppmw did not inhibit significantly the growth of cotton planted 32 weeks later. The addition of phosphorus to two silt loam soils increased the toxicity of DSMA to cotton. The incorporation of 50 ppmw of DSMA in Bosket silt loam inhibited rice growth by 75%, soybeans by 39%, oats by 12%, corn and cotton by 10%, and wheat by 0%. Rice growth was not affected in Dubbs silt loam or Sharkey clay by DSMA at concentrations as high as 100 ppmw.
10.2307/4041056|Purple nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus L.) was grown under greenhouse conditions as single tubers and various tuber chain systems. Single and repeated applications of amine methylarsonate were made to shoots of single tubers and shoots of terminal tubers in chain arrangements, and visual toxicity symptoms were noted in shoot growth both from treated tubers and from other tubers in chain arrangements. Arsenic (As) was translocated (as indicated by As content) laterally to tubers separated by at least four tubers from the treated shoot. The tuber on the opposite end of the chain from the treated shoot tended to be higher in As content than the middle tubers, and translocated As tended to be higher in tubers from which active growth was present or developed. No apparent relationship was found between As content of tubers and their ability to produce new shoots. There was some tendency for tubers to produce more than one shoot in the initial regrowth following treatment. Tuber lethality following repeated treatments evidently was due to depletion of food reserves and/or bud supply from increased sprouting and not to the accumulation of a specific level of As in the tuber.
10.2307/4041054| Water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes L.) was susceptible to applications of 6,7-dihydrodipyrido(1,2-a:2,1-c)pyrazidiinium salt (diquat). The most satisfactory rates of application were 1.0 to 1.5 lb/A of diquat. The addition of a surfactant did not increase the effectiveness of diquat. Several other chemicals gave unsatisfactory control of water lettuce. 
10.2307/4041062| The quantities of chloroplast proteins and chlorophyll were lower in oat plants treated 6 days with 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) than in the controls. Radioactive amino acid incorporation into chloroplasts indicated that the reduced levels of protein resulted from reduced synthesis. Glucose improved the amino acid incorporation in the treated tissue, but still the rate was reduced markedly by the simazine treatment. An effect of simazine even in darkness on amino acid incorporation into chloroplasts was suggested by the data. Total ribonucleic acid (RNA) content and synthesis as measured by incorporation of p were altered by simazine treatments. 
10.2307/4041066|Studies conducted near Bernardo, New Mexico, from 1962 to 1964 involved the influence of environment on weekly shoot growth and carbohydrate storage in roots and stems of undisturbed saltcedar (Tamarix pentandra Pall.) and of regrowth (plants regrown from having been mowed the previous winter). Environmental variables wee air and soil temperatures, relative humidity, wind, solar radiation, barometric pressure, evaporation from a free-water surface, depth to water table, and water quality. No variable or combination of variables could be used to predict accurately the maximum shoot growth period or the minimum carbohydrate storage. An analysis of the individual weekly growth patterns of plants showed considerable week-to-week variation in the rate of growth. Wide variations in total carbohydrate storage in roots and stems within weeks also were evident, and probably reflected the variation in growth.
10.2307/4041064|The control of vegetation along fence lines was studied using 1,2-dihydropyridazine-3,6-dione (MH) at rates of 0, 8, 10, and 12 lb/A. MH reduced plant height, did not change the number of leaves, decreased number of seed stalks, increased the number of discolored leaves, and decreased the uneven appearance. The leaf discoloration was linearly related to the application rates. Observations on species' susceptibility showed a considerable interspecies variability to MH effects. MH at 10 lb/A applied in narrow bands was effective in decreasing maintenance work along fence lines without reducing the protective cover.
10.2307/4041068|Histological abnormalities were found in Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.) roots after plants received foliar treatments of 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram). These abnormalities included destruction and distortion of cortical cells and cambial and phloem disintegration. Some or all of these conditions were present, depending upon which portion of the root was sectioned.
10.2307/4041070|Foliar and soil herbicidal treatments were made on creosotebush (Larrea tridentata (DC.) Cov.), tarbush Flourensia cernua DC.), and whitethorn (Acacia constricta Benth.) near Tombstone, Arizona, from 1957 to 1964. All herbicides were most effective when applied approximately 30 days after initiation of the summer rainy season. The herbicides 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) were about equal in effectiveness, but the relative susceptibility of the individual shrubs to the herbicides varied with treatment conditions. The acetic form of 2,4,5-T generally was more effective than the propionic; propylene glycol butyl ether, iso-octyl, and tetrahydrofurfuryl esters more effective than pentyl. Foliar applications of 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram) were most effective on whitethorn, intermediate on creosotebush, and least effective on tarbush. The most effective soil herbicidal treatments were 3-phenyl-1,1-dimethylurea (fenuron) and 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron). In general, effective control of dominant Chihuahuan Desert shrubs required 2 to 4 lb/A of 2,4-D or 2,4,5-T, 1/4 to 1 lb/A of picloram, or 2 lb/A of fenuron or monuron.
10.2307/4041065| Rates of dissipation of 6,7-dihydrodipyrido [1,2-a:2,1-c] = pyrazidiinium salt (diquat) and 1,1dimethyl-4,4-dipyridinium salt (paraquat) in water were studied from 1963 to 1965 at Davis, California. Effects of several environmental factors on dissipation of the herbicides, and herbicidal control of 9 to 14 aquatic weeds and toxicity to three kinds of fish and an Asiatic clam also were investigated. Small amounts of the herbicides were still detectable in water at the end of 12 days. In reservoirs, diquat applied at 1000 ppbw or less dissipated to 9 ppbw or less. In growth pools, a concentration of 4000 ppbw dissipated to between 600 and 900 ppbw. Dissipation of paraquat in reservoirs was slower than diquat and exhibited unpredictable fluctuations in amounts present. When 250 to 2500 ppbw of paraquat were applied in reservoirs, 0 to 180 ppbw remained after 13 days. In growth pools, 80 to 300 ppbw of paraquat persisted on the 12th day after applications of 1000 to 3000 ppbw. 
10.2307/4041058| The responses of herbicides applied singly are used in calculating the "expected" response when they are combined. The expected response for a combination is obtained by taking the product of the percent-of-control values for herbicides applied alone and dividing by (100) where n is the number of herbicides in the combination. 
10.2307/4041069|In an attempt to improve the metering of herbicides applied to soil in horticultural plantings, loosely knitted cellulose acetate cloth was impregnated with herbicides, using appropriate acre rates as determined by those used in spray applications. Treated cloth was placed on the soil and the edges anchored or the cloth was lightly covered with soil. Adjacent plots were sprayed with the same herbicides. The herbicide-impregnated cloth was as effective as spray applications of 12 of the 15 herbicides used.
10.2307/4041074|Corn was grown in soils containing root residues of giant foxtail (Setaria faberii Herrm.), yellow foxtail (Setaria glauca (L.) Beauv.), and crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop.). The effect of these residues on corn root growth was studied using a new technique which measures root response to soil properties with a single plant. Giant foxtail was the most inhibitory. Implications of these data are discussed in terms of the dominance and competitive ability of giant foxtail.
10.2307/4041071| Measurements were made of plant toxicity and of several physical and chemical properties of spray solutions containing 1,1-dimethyl-4, 4-bipyridinium salt (paraquat) and either anionic, nonionic, or cationic surfactants. Surface tension and pH values were variable among 10 surfactant-paraquat mixtures and also at 0.1 and 1.0% surfactant concentrations, but neither showed any correlation with herbicidal activity on corn when all surfactants were considered. All four nonionic, both cationic, and two out of four anionic surfactants markedly enhanced paraquat toxicity at appropriate concentrations. Studies of UV absorbance of herbicide and surfactant solutions, alone and in combination, and adsorption of paraquat-C at solution-air interfaces indicate that significant interactions occurred between paraquat and the anionic surfactants. Foliar toxicity studies offered substantiating evidence of such interactions; however, the degree or lack of enhancement of paraquat toxicity was strongly influenced by plant species (corn vs. bean) and the type and concentration of surfactant. No surfactant-paraquat combinations studied were less effective than 1/8 oz/A of paraquat used alone. 
10.2307/4041079|A laboratory sprayer, designed to make herbicide applications to potted plants and to study spray distribution patterns with different nozzles, is described. An activated charcoal air filter was installed to minimize herbicide contamination to adjoining greenhouse-laboratory facilities during the spraying operation.
10.2307/4041073|High concentrations of arsenic (As) may be expected on Coastal bermudagrass forage harvested soon after application of organic arsenicals for weed control. Stage of plant development at treatment, rainfall between treatment and harvest, rate of application of arsenical herbicides, and the amount of growth between treatment and harvest are factors influencing As residue levels in harvested material. Regrowth following removal of treated growth had a lower As concentration. Treatment application on short grass and removing and discarding the treated foliage appeared to be the most effective means of reducing As residues.
10.2307/4041077|The U.S. Department of Agriculture World Collection of Flax Germ Plasm was screened for resistance to 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine). A single plant selection of CI 719 was the most resistant. It produced dry matter equaling 33% of the control in soil treated with atrazine at 1 lb/A while Arny produced 10%. In another experiment, the selection of CI 719 produced 44% as compared to only 11% for Koto. The atrazine-resistant selection was not resistant to 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine [simazine]. Seed of this selection of CI 719 have been entered in the World Collection and assigned the number CI 2484.
10.2307/4041075|Five rates of 1-(2 methylcyclohexyl)-3-phenylurea (siduron) were applied to Cohansey and IaGreen cultivars of creeping bentgrass (Agrostis palustris). Siduron had no effect upon leaf respiration or photosynthesis of either cultivar. Cohansey was tolerant to 100 lb/A of siduron while top growth of IaGreen was reduced 90% at 1.5 lb/A. Siduron inhibited new root growth of the IaGreen cultivar and decreased root respiration.
10.2307/4041053|A new technique designed for the study of various modes of weed competition has been developed and tested. It applies to almost all environmental conditions as they affect plant growth. The technique is adaptable to single factors and multiple factors in almost any combination. The only major restriction imposed by present dimensions is that only early competition can be studied. The uniformity of seed used in closely controlled competition studies is extremely important. Heavy seeds of redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.) produced plants that brought about earlier and more intense shading than plants from light redroot pigweed seed. Applying an aluminized Mylar reflective surface on the inside of the aerial portion of the competition box increased the growth rate and development of species and shortened the time interval for experiments by 10 days.
10.2307/4040996|Rush skeletonweed (Chondrilla juncea L.), a serious agricultural pest in Australia, is increasing in the western United States. Persistence in established areas is encouraged by the resprouting of all portions of the taproot and wind borne achenes. Invasion to new areas is reduced by short achene life, the germination pattern of young seedlings, and the lack of shade tolerance. Fall applied 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram) and 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (dicamba) were effective for chemical control of spot infestations.
10.2307/4041011|Herbicide-application equipment was combined with a sled tool-carrier to plant a test crop and apply a herbicide simultaneously to single rows as surface, subsurface, incorporated, and injected sprays. Results obtained, using the methyl ester of 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben), indicated the equipment can facilitate the evaluation of the influence of method of application on the activity of herbicides applied to soil.
10.2307/4041012|A new method for taking soil samples was devised. Vacuum is used to move the soil in an air stream from the sampling site into a sealed bag. Much of the hard, time-consuming work can be eliminated with this new method of sampling. No differences were noted in bioassay plants grown in samples of soil taken in the conventional manner, as compared to plants grown in samples taken with the vacuum device.
10.2307/4040993|Experiments were conducted to determine adsorption of methanearsonate by soils, soil separates, and reference clay minerals from solutions of disodium methanearsonate (DSMA), effects of soil type and pH on the leaching of surface-applied DSMA, and effects of soil type and added organic matter on the oxidation of the methyl carbon of methanearsonate. Adsorption of methanearsonate by kaolinite and vermiculite increased with increasing concentration of DSMA in the equilibrium solution. Kaolinite and limonite adsorbed much more methanearsonate than vermiculite and montmorillonite. The clay fraction of Augusta silt loam adsorbed more methanearsonate than did the sand and silt fractions. Adsorption by whole soils was related generally to their clay contents. Leaching with 20 successive 1-in increments of water removed 52% of surface-applied methanearsonate from Norfolk loamy sand. Rates of movement of DSMA in Norfolk loamy sand did not differ at three pH levels. About one-half of the applied methanearsonate remained in the surface inch of Decatur clay loam and none was leached below 6 in. Oxidation of the methyl carbon of methanearsonate was associated with oxidation of soil organic matter in each soil. In three of the soils, there was no evidence of microbiological adaptation to methanearsonate. In Norfolk loamy sand, however, increasing decomposition of methanearsonate relative to soil organic matter occurred with time of incubation. Decomposition of added plant material in this soil enhanced the oxidation of methanearsonate.
10.2307/4041006|Selective control of red sorrel (Rumex acetosella L.) in Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) seed fields was obtained with 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (dicamba), 7-oxabicyclo(2.2.1)-heptane-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (endothall), 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben), 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid (fenac), and 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA). Kentucky bluegrass seed yields and germination were not significantly reduced by application of any of the herbicides in the fall even though rates higher than necessary for red sorrel control were used. Application of dicamba in the spring at more than 1/2 lb/A reduced Kentucky bluegrass seed yields and germination. Endothall reduced seed yields when applied in the spring at 4 or 5 lb/A.
10.2307/4040997|This work is an endeavor to aid researchers located in remote areas as well as researchers who may have experienced difficulties in the regulation of controlled environment chambers. Descriptions of the maintenance and use of controlled environment chambers contained herein were compiled over an 8-year period of experience with four chambers. Although the physical characteristics of the controlled environment chambers described are dissimilar from many, the causes and remedies of malfunctions are general and typical of those found in many controlled environment chambers. Several protective devices for expensive equipment are described as well as several common malfunctions and their remedies.
10.2307/4040995|In field, soil culture, and nutrient culture experiments, 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) increased percent total nitrogen in all species studied, whether resistant, intermediate, or susceptible to 1 lb/A of atrazine. However, nitrogen content per plant was either unaffected or decreased by these atrazine treatments. One lb/A of atrazine increased percent protein and nitrate nitrogen in most species studied. Atrazine susceptibility apparently was related to its effect on percent non-protein and ammonia in the species tested. One lb/A of atrazine had no effect on percent non-protein nitrogen and decreased percent ammonia nitrogen in resistant species but increased both fractions in intermediate and susceptible species. One lb/A of 2-hydroxy-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (hereafter referred to as hydroxyatrazine), a degradation product of atrazine, had no consistent effect on any nitrogen fraction studied.
10.2307/4041014| A 0.25-mil mylar film was used as a part of an in-situ autoradiographic technique for studying C-labeled compounds in soil containing growing corn (Zea mays L., var. WF9  Hy) roots. This technique facilitates herbicide movement studies in soils and plants while plants grow undisturbed. 
10.2307/4041003| Uptake of phosphorus by red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) seedling roots from a medium containing .0015 ppm P was stimulated at 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) levels of 5 and 10 ppmw but inhibited at higher levels of 15 and 20 ppmw. Concentrations of simazine between 5 and 20 ppmw resulted in increased translocation of phosphorus from roots to stem and needles with increasing incubation time from 12 to 96 hr. Combinations of simazine at 10 ppmw with P at concentrations above 20 ppm resulted in decreased phosphorus uptake for incubation periods less than 72 hr. Phosphorus content of stems was not greatly influenced by simazine treatment or P concentration, but phosphorus content of needles was significantly higher in response to simazine. 
10.2307/4041008|The herbicide 5-amino-4-chloro-2-phenyl-3(2H)-pyridazinone (pyrazon) was selective for sugar beets (Beta vulgaris L.). In preemergence treatments, sugar beets tolerated pyrazon at rates up to 6 lb/A, but at this level some mortality occurred. On the other hand, some weed species were susceptible to levels as low as 2 lb/A. Between emergence and the cotyledon stage, both beets and weeds were quite susceptible and the phytotoxicity of pyrazon increased with increasing temperature. In the late cotyledon stage, beets were resistant to pyrazon in aqueous suspension and partially susceptible to an oil-water suspension. Beets in the two to four-leaf stage tolerated an oil-water herbicidal combination, while lambsquarters (Chenopodium albium L.) and redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.) remained susceptible up to the six to eight-leaf stage. Rape (Brassica napus L.) was of intermediate susceptibility. In general, preemergence treatments were the most promising but could be replaced by postemergence treatments of pyrazon in an oil-water emulsion.
10.2307/4041009| Astragalus miser Dougl., var. oblongifolius (Rydb.) Cronq. was analyzed for seasonal and physical distribution of its contained poison. Small chickens (Gallus domesticus, Arbor Acre  Vantress hybrids) and cattle (Bos taurus, Hereford) were used as test animals. The poisonous compound was extracted from dried plants with 95% ethanol, evaporated and redissolved in water, then semi-purified by several extractions with chloroform for toxicological studies. The poison was found primarily in the green leaves. The plants were very poisonous until they began drying in August. Once leaves became bleached at senescence, toxicity disappeared. Plants treated with the triethylamine salt of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) and the alkyl amine salts of 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)-propionic acid (silvex) were less poisonous to cattle than untreated plants. Acute poisoning in chickens was characterized by depression, accelerated heart action, followed by congestion of lungs, cardiac insufficiency, paralysis, and heart failure. Chronically poisoned birds exhibited the same syndrome but sustained more severe liver damage. 
10.2307/4040999| Experiments were conducted on black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) to determine the effect of auxin distribution and degradation on the formation of root suckers. Stump sprouting and root suckering occurred when black locust seedlings were decapitated, and the presence of stump sprouts prevented root suckering. The influence of stump sprouts could be replaced by applying indoleacetic acid (IAA) in lanolin paste to the cut surfaces of root stubs. These results provide additional support for an apical dominance theory of suckering. When IAA-2-C in lanolin was applied to the cut surfaces of root stubs, autoradiographs showed that C activity was concentrated where the majority of root suckers normally would develop. Apparently, IAA accumulated in this region and inhibited root suckering. When the IAA-lanolin paste was removed from the root stubs after inhibiting suckering for a month, vigorous root suckcring took place. This indicated the possibility that black locust roots contain an IAA oxidase system. The existence of such a system was demonstrated by dialyzed enzyme preparations extracted from black locust roots which oxidized IAA in a Warburg apparatus. 
10.2307/4041010|Soil surface applications of crabgrass (Digitaria spp.) herbicides prevented rooting of Bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon L., var. 328) from the stolon nodes. Inhibition of root development was confined to the areas of the stolon which were in direct contact with dimethyl 2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalate (DCPA). Placement of the herbicides at various soil depths reduced the number of roots developing below the treatment; however, normal root growth occurred above the treated layer. Under field conditions, certain crabgrass herbicides delayed normal rooting of Bermudagrass from nodes for 12 weeks. Established root systems were not appreciably altered by the herbicidal treatments.
10.2307/4041005|The anatomy of the first internodes of three different lengths of giant foxtail (Setaria faberii Herrm.) was studied in the seedling stage. Epidermis was non-cutinized throughout the entire length. Least cortical breakdown occurred in an area 1 cm below the coleoptilar node, regardless of the length of internode. Endodermis and pericycle were present throughout the internode length, but identity was lost at the coleoptilar node and above. The number of metaxylem and protoxylem elements decreased basipetally from the coleoptilar node. Adventitious root primordia, found in all first internodes, originated from the pericycle. The total number of primordia, at the growth stage studied, appears to be proportional to the length of the internode, with fewer primordia in the 1-cm sections below the coleoptilar node. The implications of root and shoot uptake are discussed in terms of the anatomy of the first internode.
10.2307/4041015|Encroachment of woody species reduces the productivity of sphagnum moss (Sphagnum sp.) in acid bogs. Leatherleaf (Chamaedaphne calyculata (L.) Moench) and black chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa (Michx.) Willd.) were major species of concern to moss harvesters. Black chokeberry was controlled by spray applications in spring of 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram) at 1 lb/A. Leatherleaf was controlled by either fall or spring applications of picloram at 1 lb/A. No control was obtained with eight other herbicides tested. Sphagnum moss carried phytotoxic residues three growing seasons after picloram application.
10.2307/4040994|Narrow bands of activated charcoal sprayed on the soil surface directly over the rows seeded with alfalfa (Medicago sativa L., var. Cayuga) in the field protected the legume from damage by a broadcast application of 2-isopropylamino-4-(3-methoxypropylamino)-6-methylthio-s-triazine (hereafter referred to as G-36393). Charcoal suspended in water and applied at 25 to 50 lb/A, gave adequate protection from 1.5 lb/A G-36393. Higher rates of charcoal, 100 lb/A, were necessary to protect the legume from a 3.0 lb/A application. Charcoal did not protect alfalfa seedlings from 1.5 lb/A 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine).
10.2307/4040998|Environmental and physical factors influencing the effectiveness of preemergence applications (4 lb/A) of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron) were evaluated under field conditions for 10 Hawaiian sugar cane (Saccharum officinarum L.) plantations. Rainfall, soil pH, organic composition, time lapse between field harvest and herbicide application, and maximum temperature had a significant effect on the resultant period of weed control. The data from 295 field tests conducted over a 10-year period then were subjected to multiple regression analysis. The prediction equation derived via these calculations was sufficiently accurate to justify its application to the Hawaiian sugar cane regions. The single most important factor adversely influencing the pre-emergence activity of diuron was the lapse of time between harvest and application, a factor within the control of the plantation personnel.
10.2307/4041001|Both direct and indirect effects of the environment, and the possible role of the crop in modifying the environment of the weeds, are considered. High humidities and high temperatures in general increase susceptibility, and temperature also may have important morphogenetic effects. Low light intensity before, and high intensity after, spraying appear to increase susceptibility. Light also may affect leaf morphogenesis. Soil condition also may affect susceptibility, particularly soil residues of certain herbicides, and crop competition may contribute to weed mortality. The relationship of stage of growth at spraying to susceptibility is also discussed.
10.2307/4041016|Soil dispersion in an aqueous solution of sodium hexametaphosphate and sodium bicarbonate facilitates extraction of seeds by flotation with megnesium sulphate. The percentage viability of seeds collected in this manner subsequently can be determined with 2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride. Extraction of seeds usually is 100% efficient and enumeration of viable seeds via the tetrazolium test is accomplished much more rapidly than with conventional methods.
10.2307/4041002|The effects of four densities of annual broadleaf weeds and annual grass weeds and an equal combination of the two on the yields of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) roots and tops, percent sucrose and total solids, average diameter of beet roots, and total plot yields were studied during 1964 and 1965. Broadleaf weeds were more competitive than annual grass weeds and the effects of an equal combination were intermediate. Without cultivation, all weed densities reduced the yield of beet roots below the weed-free plots. Twenty broadleaf weeds/sq ft were required to reduce yields when plots were cultivated and weeds were limited to a 10-in band over the beet row. The effects on the yield of beet tops, average root diameter, and total plot yield were similar to the effects on beet root yield. The components of total plot yield are examined. No weed density had a real effect on beet stand, percent total solids, or percent sucrose of the beet roots.
10.2307/4041004| The metabolism of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole) in bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L., var. Black Valentine) corn (Zea may L., var. Batam Cross), and sugar beet (Beta saccharifera L.) leaves was studied with both C and tritium-labeled amitrole. Insignificant amounts of C were recovered in the respired CO from plants given amitrole-5-C. The metabolic conversion of amitrole in leaves was exponential and can be expressed by an equation for a first order reaction. The half-time of amitrole in sugar beet, corn, and bean leaves were 18.7, 28.0, and 23.2 hr, respectively. Radioactivity from amitrole-5-C was found in extracts or nucleic acids, proteins, and other plant constituents. Largest amounts of radioactivity were recovered as alcohol soluble metabolites. Experiments with (amitrole-H) and (amitrole-5-C) showed the position of hydrogen substitution in each alcohol soluble metabolite. 
10.2307/4041013| The influence of pH and incubation time on the detoxication of 11 herbicides incorporated into high organic matter soils was investigated. Five of the chemicals were detoxified at different rates at the various pH levels. Optimum pH levels for the detoxication of these chemicals were (a) pH 5.3 for 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (dicamba) and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), (b) 6.5 for 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon) and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole), and (c) pH 7.5 for S-propyl dipropylthiocarbamate (vernolate). Slow positive detoxication, without pH influence, was observed for 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron) and 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben). No detectable detoxication was observed for 4-amino-2,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram), ,,,-trifluoro-2,6-dinitro-N,N-dipropyl-p-toluidine (trifluralin), 5-bromo-3-isopropyl-6-methyluracil (isocil), or 2-methoxy-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (prometone). 
10.2307/4041000|Spring and fall applications of 10 soil sterilant herbicides were investigated for control of brush and herbaceous vegetation at five locations in Texas. A majority of the herbicides controlled most brush species. However, 5-bromo-3-sec-butyl-6-methyluracil (bromacil), 2-methoxy-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (prometone), and 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram) were most effective at all locations. A mixture of disodium tetraborates, 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron) and trichlorobenzoic acid was very effective for at least 20 months at four of the five locations. Most herbicides controlled herbaceous vegetation for 1 year or less. Bromacil controlled herbaceous vegetation for approximately 2 years at most locations.
10.2307/4041007|Residues of 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid (fenac) and 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile (dichlobenil) were determined in irrigation water flowing over canal-bottom plots treated with the herbicides prior to the entry of water. Concentrations of fenac and dichlobenil in the first water to flow over the entire treated plots were 8.82 and 8.63 ppm, respectively. The bulk of the residues was transported from the plots in a very short time, and safe levels were reached after 1 hr of water flow. The dichlobenil burden, picked up by water as it flowed over the treated plot, was effectively reduced as the water passed over untreated canal soil downstream.
10.2307/4041185|Preliminary observations indicate that tobacco is extremely sensitive to 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram). This study was conducted to determine the effect of time and rate of treatment on tobacco yield, quality, dollars per acre, and the effect on chemical constituents in the tobacco. Results indicated that picloram remaining in the soil as a residue at rates of 5 g/A and above can cause serious damage to tobacco. A broadcast spray applied shortly after setting the tobacco in the field was most injurious to tobacco. One-half g/A at this time reduced dollars per acre by about 50%. The tobacco plant gained tolerance to 2.5 g/A by the time it was 24 in tall. Treatments made when the tobacco was 24 in tall and also when treated after topping controlled suckers at rates of 0.5 and also at 2.5 g/A.
10.2307/4041174|Aerial herbicide treatments were made on a native stand of short-leaf pine (Pinus echinata Mill.) heavily infested with noncommercial oak (Quercus sp.), hickory (Carya sp.), and associated species in southeastern Oklahoma from 1957 through 1960. Two formulations of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) were applied in May and September at 1 1/2 lb/A annually in one, two, and three applications with the later two made a year apart. The most diameter growth for all sizes of pine measured occurred following May treatments. Late May aerial applications also were made with 2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy) propionic acid (dichloroprop) and 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy) propionic acid (silvex). Silvex reduced pine cone development, seed fill, and germination. Native grass growth was increased twice following good weed tree control. However, where dense short-leaf pine seedlings developed, the native grasses were smothered and volume of herbage decreased.
10.2307/4041191| Many acid herbicides must be methylated before analysis by gas-liquid chromatography. Several reagents were evaluated for the esterification of substituted acid herbicides. Esterification by the different methods was determined on 2,3,6-trichlorophenyl-acetic acid [fenac], 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid [2,3,6-TBA], 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid [picloram], 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid [dicamba], and 3,6-dichlorosalicylic acid, a possible metabolite of dicamba. The effect of substituent size and position is discussed in relation to esterification. The best methylating reagent for acid herbicides was diazomethane although it is toxic, explosive, and more costly than the other methods. BF-methanol was equally as good when the compound was not sterically hindered. Water interfered with the esterification efficiency of all reagents. Diazomethane esterified the ammonium salt but not the sodium salt of the acids used. 
10.2307/4041190|The herbicidal activity of potassium azide and calcium cyanamid, applied singly and in combination, was evaluated in greenhouse and field experiments. In the greenhouse, the combinations were synergistic against several plant species including yellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus L.) and crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop). The combinations also were synergistic in two field experiments at different locations. In the field, the combinations reduced the number of weed seeds germinating from treated soil over a 6-month period; potassium azide or calcium cyanamid applied singly were not effective. In the laboratory, calcium cyanamid reduced the rate of disappearance of potassium azide from the soil.
10.2307/4041178|Under controlled conditions in a growth chamber, emergence of tumblegrass (Schedonnardus paniculatus (Nutt.) Trel.), redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), and barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crusgalli (L.) Beauv.) was best with an 8-hr night temperature of 65 F and a 16-hr day temperature of 80 F. Other temperature ranges, in order of decreasing effectiveness in stimulating emergence, were 80-95, 50-65, and 35-50 F. Best emergence occurred at the 1/2-in depth of planting followed by 1/4, 1, 2, and 4 in. Barnyardgrass was the only weed that emerged appreciably from the 4-in depth. Average emergence was better on a coarse-textured soil than on a fine-textured soil. Under dry soil conditions, emergence was reduced by soil crusting.
10.2307/4041183|Quantitative measurements were made by cucumber root bioassay of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) contained in washoff (water-soil mixture) from cultivated fallow Cecil sandy loam soil. Formulations of 2,4-D used included iso-octyl and propylene glycol butyl either esters and an alkanolamine salt of the ethanol and isopropanol series. Simulated rainfall intensities and storm durations used represented storm frequencies of 1, 10, 80, and greater than 100 years. The 2,4-D applied at rates of 2.2 or 4.4 lb/A was assayed in washoff and as residue in the soil. Concentrations of 2,4-D in washoff were positively correlated with the rate applied, were greatest early in each storm, and decreased with duration of the storm. The iso-octyl and butyl ether ester formulations of 2,4-D were far more susceptible to removal in washoff than the amine salt. When the amine salt was used, 2,4-D concentrations in washoff were less than 1 ppm, even in the early stages of runoff, whereas concentrations as high as 4.2 ppm were measured using an iso-octyl ester formulation of 2,4-D. When a direct comparison was made between the butyl ether ester and amine salt forms of 2,4-D, ester or amine losses were respectively, 13 and 4% following a 1-year frequency storm and 26 and 5% following a 100-year frequency storm. Soil bioassays showed that most of the 2,4-D remained in the surface 3 in of soil.
10.2307/4041173| A quantitative colorimetric procedure was developed for the determination of N-glucosyl amiben in tissue sections of etiolated seedlings. N-glucosyl amiben biosynthesis in soybean hypocotyl sections was heat labile, sensitive to freezing and thawing, unaffected under anaerobic conditions, dependent on amiben concentration, and proportional to tissue section concentration. The formation of N-glucosyl amiben in soybean hypocotyl sections was greatest between pH 6.3 and pH 7.3 and was inhibited by NaF, HgCl, iodoacetate, iodoacetamide, and N-ethylmaleimide but not by NaCN or NaN. On a specific activity basis, sugar beet seedling, soybean cotyledon, and soybean hypocotyl tissue sections were the most active tissues studied in the biosynthesis of N-glucosyl amiben. 
10.2307/4041186| Results of studies with the herbicide 1-(3-chloro-4-methylphenyl)-3-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (hereinafter referred to as BV-207) suggest that it interferes appreciably with photosynthesis. A concentration of 10 M of BV-207 almost completely inhibited fixation of labelled carbon dioxide by leaf disks of various plants. In addition, carbohydrates protected plants from the phytotoxic action of the chemical. BV-207 was considerably more toxic when plants received light after application of the herbicide, compared with those held in the dark. On the other hand, root growth was inhibited only slightly by BV-207. 
10.2307/4041194|Virginia chain fern (Woodwardia virginica (L.) Smith) was controlled by 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile (dichlobenil) in cranberry bogs on a St. Johns soil at Chatsworth, New Jersey, in experiments conducted during 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, and 1964. The treatments were applied at emergence of the weed. Stalk counts of the fern were recorded the year following treatment. Excellent control was obtained at either 4 or 8 lb/A of dichlobenil. No re-growth occurred in subsequent years.
10.2307/4041171|Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.), a submersed aquatic weed, has seriously interfered with many water uses in the TVA reservoirs. More than 150 test plots were treated with 34 herbicides from 1960 through 1965. More effective results were obtained with granular preparations of butoxyethanol ester, 2-ethyl hexanol ester, and propylene glycol butyl ether ester of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and liquid preparations of propylene glycol butyl ether ester and potassium salt of 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid (silvex). The two most effective control methods found from field tests were (a) lowering the lake levels enough to permit complete drying of stems and root crowns and (b) applying butoxyethanol ester of 2,4-D in a 20% granular form. Applications of this herbicide to about 3,700 acres at rates of 20 and 40 lb/A gave results that varied from excellent control in protected embayments to poor control in moving water on these large impoundments.
10.2307/4041175|The dimethylamine salt and isopropyl and isooctyl ester formulations of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) were applied at 0, 1/2, 1, 2, and 4 lb/A 21, 14, and 7 days before harvesting Bison hard red winter wheat. Treatment effects on yield, chemical composition, or milling and baking properties of the grain were either nil or of no practical significance. When treated with 1/2 or 1 lb/A, rates generally recommended for farm use, 2,4-D residues in the grain ranged from 0.04 to 0.27 ppm. As rates of the three formulations of 2,4-D were increased from 1/2 to 4 lb/A, increasing amounts of 2,4-D residues occurred in the grain and reached a maximum of 1.8 ppm when the isopropyl ester of 2,4-D was applied at 4 lb/A 14 days before harvest. Grain from plots treated 21 days before harvest had less 2,4-D residue than grain from plots treated 14 and 7 days before harvest.
10.2307/4041172|Complete control of annual bluegrass (Poa annua L.) at all levels of P and at both planting dates was obtained with a,a,a-trifluoro-2,6-dinitro-N,N-dipropyl-p-toluidine (trifluralin) at 2 lb/A. For both planting dates, high levels of P reduced the effectiveness of both calcium arsenate (CaAs) and to a small degree dimethyl 2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalate (DCPA). On a plant count basis, O-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)O-methyl isopropylphosphoramidothioate (DMPA) was more effective than N-(2-mercaptoethyl) benzenesulfonamide S-(O,O,-diisopropyl phosphorodithioate) (bensulide) for the control of annual bluegrass. In the field, injury to bentgrasses (Agrostis palustris Huds.) from preemergence herbicides generally was specific to one or two varieties. Washington bentgrass was severely injured from a 12-lb/A application of 1-(2-methylcyclohexyl)-3-phenylurea (siduron).
10.2307/4041176|Several herbicides were used for control of weeds in Jersey Orange sweet potato plantings on a sandy loam soil at Hammonton, New Jersey, during 1960, 1961, and 1962. The treatments were applied preemergence to the weeds at transplanting of the crop. Data included crop injury scores, level of weed control, effects on yield, influence on internal root color and flavor, and effects on sprouting. Excellent control of germinating annual weeds was obtained with 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben), 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile (dichlobenil). N,N-dimethyl-2,2-diphenylacetamide (diphenamid), and dimethyl 2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalate (DCPA). These herbicides had no adverse effects on yield, quality factors, or growth.
10.2307/4041181|Preemergence herbicides were applied to lawn turf on a loam soil in April, 1963. Polychlorodicyclopentadiene isomers, N-2-mercaptoethyl)benzenesulfonamide (bensulide), calcium arsenate, 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,8a-octachloro-4,7-methano-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydroindane (chlordane), dimethyl 2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalate (DCPA) 0-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-0-methyl isopropylphosphoramidothioate (DMPA) and 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-tolyl-methylcarbamate (terbutol) were included. Soil of the respective plots were sampled from 0 to 2- and 2 to 4-in depths in December. These soils samples were used for planting plugs of mature Merion Kentucky bluegrass. The cultures were grown for 18 days in the greenhouse. Twenty-three in of rain had fallen between the treatment and sampling dates. Yet root growth was seriously reduced in the soil from the 0 to 2-in depth that had received terbutol and bensulide. Several chemicals gave significant reductions in topgrowth. Preemergence herbicide residues had sufficient influence on Kentucky bluegrass type lawn turf to justify specific study of each chemical with regard to this factor before widespread use.
10.2307/4041184|A 4-year field study was conducted to determine losses and gains in alfalfa production and utilization due to direct competition of various densities of Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.) and their control. Regardless of initial Canada thistle density, within 4 years all stands under no control approached one plant/sq ft. Mowing after each grazing period for 4 years almost eliminated Canada thistle. Throughout the study, the rate of alfalfa stand reduction was the same under mowing treatment regardless of Canada thistle density. Mowing increased alfalfa production 6.2 T/A in 4 years over no control in plots having initial Canada thistle stands of two plants/sq ft. The production loss due to Canada thistle stands of two plants/sq ft was 7.4 T of alfalfa for a 4-year period. Alfalfa consumption was reduced 4.5 T/A.
10.2307/4041188|In field experiments, corn (Zea mays var. Dixie 18) and Johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense) seeds were planted in Norfolk sandy loam soil and treated preemergence with 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) at 0, 2, 4, and 16 lb/A. In growth chamber studies, corn seeds were planted in flats of Independence loamy fine sand and treated pereemergence with atrazine at 0, 2, and 4 lb/A. In nutrient culture studies, corn was treated with 0, 2, 4, and 8 ppmw atrazine. Treated plants of all species and rates tested usually were smaller than untreated plants and contained higher nitrogen percentages. Corn and Johnsongrass plants treated with high rates of atrazine always contained less nitrogen (mg/plant) than untreated plants. Atrazine-treated corn plants contained higher percentages of both 80% ethanol soluble and insoluble nitrogen than the checks. Percentage increases in both fractions were proportional to the rate of atrazine treatment. Nitrate percentages also were increased, but free ammonia content was not significantly affected.
10.2307/4041193| Visible symptoms of injury in susceptible oat plants were not apparent until 4 days after initial exposure to 1 ppm 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) solution. However, the herbicide affected normal absorption and translocation over this period of time. The expected translocation and uniform distribution of xylem transported atrazine-C was stopped after 2 days of exposure to atrazine. The reduction in translocation of atrazine-C to the shoot apices in early stages of herbicidal injury was not due to reduced asborption but very likely to some other factor such as reduced transpiration. Reduction in atrazine-C absorption reduced translocation to the shoot apices, but this probably was not an important factor in the early stages of injury. Absorption of atrazine-C by oat plants was not reduced until 3 days of exposure to atrazine. A reduction in carbohydrate concentration, resulting in injury to root tissues, may be responsible for reduction in total atrazine-C absorption. 
10.2307/4041187| Tracer studies employing 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon)-2-C and -Cl were conducted on barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), and three hypostomatous species-zebrina (Zebrina pendula Schnizl.), coleus (Coleus blumei Benth.), and nasturtium (Trapoelum majus L.). Count data and radioautographic evidence showed that greater amounts of dalapon were absorbed and translocated at high (88  3%) than medium (60  5%) or low (28  3%) post-treatment relative humidity (herein called R.H.). Also, greater uptake and translocation of C occurred in bean at 43  1 C than at 26  1 C post-treatment temperature, with constant R.H. and light conditions. Rate of droplet drying, and stomatal distribution and behavior, apparently contributed to the R.H. effect. Droplets dried less rapidly at high than at low R.H., thus prolonging the period of effective absorption. At low R.H., periodic rewetting of the droplet area enhanced absorption and translocation but never to the extent achieved with high ambient R.H. (in growth chambers) or in saturated atmosphere (polyethylene bagging in the greenhouse). High R.H. (95  3%) favored stomatal opening in zebrina, and uptake of dalapon was greater through the abaxial than adaxial surface of leaf disks of zebrina, coleus, and nasturtium. Rewetting of droplets or high ambient R. H., however, promoted uptake through astomatous as well as stomated surfaces. Absorption and translocation were markedly greater in bean plants grown at 95  3% R.H. than at 28  3% R.H., both treated under high R.H. conditions. Thus cuticle hydration and ontogeny also were implicated in the R.H. phenomenon. Several solution additives also were studied in an attempt to substitute for the R.H. effect. At low R.H., a surfactant (X-77) markedly enhanced uptake of dalapon in bean, glycerol (a humectant) and hexadecanol (a filming agent) were less advantageous, and Plyac (a sticker-spreader) decreased penetration. Results of these studies aid in explaining the greater toxicity of dalapon in regions of high R.H. and, conversely, its sometimes erratic performance in drier climates. The results also confirm the distribution and accumulation patterns of dalapon absorbed by plants and the usefulness of an effective spray adjuvant in promoting foliar absorption. 
10.2307/4041195|Experiments were conducted to evaluate the preplant incorporation and preemergence activity of several herbicides for weed control in southern peas (Vigna sinensis (L.) End.). The selectivity of 4,5,7-trichlorobenzthiadiazole-2,1,3 and 4-(methylsulfonyl)-2,6-dinitro-N,N-dipropylaniline has been demonstrated. Eight other chemicals generally gave good weed control but resulted in injury to the peas.
10.2307/4041180|Rhizome differentation in yellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus L.), cultured under 12 1/2, 14, and 15 1/2-hr photoperiods, 21-16, 27-21, and 33-27 C temperatures (day and night, respectively), Hoagland solutions of 1/32, 1/8, and 1/2 strength nitrogen (N), and 0, 10, and 1000 ppm gibberellin (GA), was investigated in controlled-environment chambers. High levels of N, long photoperiods, and high levels of GA at the shortest photoperiods inhibited tuberization whereas high temperatures at the lowest N level favored tuberization. Shoot formation was promoted by high levels of N, long photoperiods, and high temperatures under 12 1/2 and 14-hr photoperiods while GA had a retarding effect. The higher levels of N, temperature, and GA decreased carbohydrate level whereas the longer photoperiods increased it. It may be concluded that tuberization is not only the result of surplus carbohydrates in the plant but is controlled also by some GA-like substances regulated in the plant under specific conditions of photoperiod and temperature.
10.2307/4041177|The toxicity, adsorption, and leaching of four herbicides in different soils were determined by a method based on a sensitive root bio-assay which appeared suitable for herbicides affecting root growth. The rate of leaching of the herbicides was determined by measuring the herbicidal effect of the leachate obtained from three heights of soil columns. The same bio-assay was utilized for testing the extent of inactivation of herbicides due to adsorption by soil. In this case, mixtures of various rates of soil with silica sand were used as cultures for the bio-assay.
10.2307/4041179| To evaluate the effect of different soil moisture levels on the phytotoxicity of soil applications of arsenic trioxide (AsO), water and alcohol extractable soil arsenic (As) data were related to the growth and development of 4-month-old Monterey pine (Pinus radiata D. Don.) in greenhouse soil cultures. Also, various rates of AsO and water were applied to the surface of soil columns to determine the effective penetration of soluble As. Under normal moisture regime, 8000 lb/A of AsO were required for high phytotoxicity on a Chenango silt loam, with excessive moisture resulting in an increase in this phytotoxic effect. With water and alcohol extraction procedures, an adequate range of values was obtained in relation to the total AsO rates and plant responses. Lethal concentrations of As in the soil columns were limited to the surface 3 in depth in the silt loam. 
10.2307/4041192|Preemergence applications of 5-bromo-3-sec-butyl-6-methyl-uracil (bromacil) and mixtures containing bromacil controlled both broadleaf and grass weeds best, and increased seed production and quality in side-oats grama [Bouteloua curtipendula (Michx.) Torr.] fields. Other herbicides significantly reduced broadleaf weeds but did not control grass weeds. The most troublesome grasses were foxtails; bristly foxtail [Setaria verticillata (L.) Beauv.] was the most prominent. Weed competition, in plots where herbicides were ineffective, significantly lowered seed production. Excessive rainfall after treatment was probably responsible for decreased weed control and increased crop damage from some of the herbicides. Applications of 2,3,5-trichloro-4-pyridinol (pyriclor) resulted in early crop chlorosis.
10.2307/4041189|Satisfactory selectivity of 4-chloro-2-butynyl m-chloro-carbanilate (barban) for the control of wild oats (Avena fatua L.) in spring wheat was obtained when it was applied from 4 to 14 days after emergence of wild oats. Following this period, the effectiveness and selectivity declined rapidly. Depending on the season, this period of maximum efficiency represented the following growth stages of wild oats; 1 to 3-leaf stage in 1960, 1 1/2 to 3 1/2-leaf stage in 1961, and 1 1/2 to 2 1/2-leaf stage in 1962. Injury to wheat was most pronounced during a period beginning about 15 days after crop emergence and continuing for several weeks. This pattern of wild oat control and wheat susceptibility was virtually identical over the 3-year period even though growing conditions varied considerably. This suggests that days after emergence may be at least as reliable as leaf stages as an index for the proper timing of barban treatments and would be more easily determined under practical field conditions. If leaf stages are used, then spraying should not be recommended later than 2 1/2-leaf stage, since in some years, wild oats will have reached resistant stages. Furthermore, it may be desirable to apply barban early, perhaps even before all the plants are fully in the 2 1/2-leaf stage. When wild oats reach the 2-leaf stage, it may be too late, at least in years of abundant moisture.
10.2307/4041196| Herbicides which contain primary or secondary amino groups may be detected on thin layers of silica gel G or silica gel H with 1% tert-butyl hypochlorite, followed with an aqueous solution of 1% KI and 1% soluble starch. Detection limits range from approximately 1 g to less than 0.05 g, depending upon the herbicide in question. The technique also appears to be effective for aromatic or aliphatic iodides. 
10.2307/4041182|A series of three experiments was conducted from 1951 to 1963 for the control of western snowberry (Symphoricarpos occidentalis Hook.) in southern Nebraska. Western snowberry was best controlled with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) when sprayed in early full foliage. Timeliness of herbicide application was considered the most important factor in a control program. Excellent control was obtained with 1 to 2 lb/A of the isopropyl ester of 2,4-D in all studies. The triethanol amine salt of 2,4-D was less effective. A 1:1 mixture of 2,4-D + 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) at 1 and 2 lb/A, 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA) at 1 and 2 lb/A, and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole) at 2 and 4 lb/A were not as effective for western snowberry control as 2,4-D. Mowing was an ineffective method of control.
10.2307/4041206|A soil column system for determination of relative movement of herbicides in soils is described. A data presentation system which expresses the results for each herbicide in a given soil as a single number is proposed. Comparisons of mobilities of new herbicides with those known for other older, better understood herbicides should make it possible to predict the behavior of new herbicides in the field. The aromatic acid herbicides were most mobile, and the insoluble toluidines least mobile. Results for 28 herbicides are presented.
10.2307/4041205| Herbicidal residues in water and soil were determined after treating eight ponds with six herbicides. Relatively high concentrations of 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile (dichlobenil), 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid (fenac), and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) were present in the upper 1-in of the hydrosoil following treatments with granular formulations of these herbicides. Fenac and dichlobenil residues persisted in both water and soil for periods exceeding 160 days. Low concentrations of 2,4-D were found in water for 24 days and in the soil for 55 days following treatment. The mono-N,N-dimethylcocoamine salt of 7-oxabicyclo(2.2.1)heptane-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (amine salt of endothall), 1,1-dimethyl-4,4-bipyridinium salt (paraquat), and 6,7-dihydrodipyrido(1,2-a:2,1-c)-pyrazidiinium salt (diquat) were relatively less persistent in water and were no longer found after 24, 8, and 4 days, respectively. However, paraquat and diquat were held by the hydrosoils and persisted in high concentrations for more than 85 and 160 days, respectively. In ponds with dense weed infestations, a large fraction of the herbicide may be held by the plants for some time. 
10.2307/4041213| Three experiments were conducted over a period of 2 years on native grasslands in an attempt to suppress or control the resident vegetation to permit the establishment of alfalfa. Spring applications of 1,1-dimethyl-4,4 bipyridilium salt (paraquat) at 1 lb/A were effective in suppressing the existing grasses and forbs, thereby enhancing alfalfa establishment; however, woody perennials were not effectively controlled. Application of a mixture of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid(butyl ester of 2,4-D) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (iso-octyl ester of 2,4,5-T) (2:1 ratio) at 1 1/2 lb/A prior to paraquat treatments and alfalfa seeding also was ineffective in controlling woody perennials. Alfalfa could not be successfully established when seeded 6 days after the application of phenoxy herbicides. Fall applications of paraquat at rates up to 1.5 lb/A were not effective in suppressing the resident vegetation; thus, alfalfa seeded in the following spring failed to establish an adequate stand. 
10.2307/4041223|Selected clones of field bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis L.) differing in susceptibility to foliage applications of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) were used in testing some of the various mechanisms proposed for the selective action of this chemical. The differences found in external morphology, such as degree of pubescence and number of stomata, showed no relationship to the selective action of 2,4-D. Entry of the chemical into the plant and translocation within the stem also were not critical factors. The most pronounced physiological differences between resistant and susceptible clones of bindweed occurred at the cellular level. When incubated in a nutrient agar containing 2,4-D, excised stem sections of both clones produced callus tissue, but the callus of the susceptible clone, as compared to the resistant, was approximately double in volume, dry weight, and degree of hydration. With increasing age, stem sections of the susceptible clone became even more responsive to 2,4-D; the reverse was true for the resistant. The differential response of the two clones was less pronounced when 2,4-D was applied to the roots than when it was applied to the foliage.
10.2307/4041211|Wet tropical forests have a high diversity of woody species which cause problems in sampling and analysis of data regarding herbicidal effectiveness. Three simplified sampling procedures were tested to determine their reliability in providing an estimate of whole-plot defoliation from broadcast applications. A procedure using a 50-tree sample including all species will provide the most reliable data.
10.2307/4041214|Corn, cotton, peanuts, and soybeans in various rotations received six separate herbicidal treatments in a 5-year rotation from 1959 through 1963. Several of the combination treatments were highly effective in controlling witchweed (Striga spp.). Land heavily infested with witchweed required 3 to 4 years of herbicidal treatments before the competition of witchweed was eliminated and normal corn yields were produced. The most effective treatment for the control of witchweed without crop injury was postemergence applications of 1/2 lb/A 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) as needed in continuous corn. At the end of the 5-year study, all plots were planted to corn, Using corn yields as a criteria, there were no differences in witchweed competition in herbicide treated plots with continuous corn and herbicide treated plots in which corn was rotated with other crops.
10.2307/4041208|A field study was made on the competitive effect of quackgrass (Agropyron repens (L.) Beauv.) on corn for the nutrients N, P, and K during 1962 and 1963. Quackgrass competition drastically reduced corn height and yield and delayed maturity. High levels of fertilization did not overcome the effects of quackgrass competition. The annual uptake by quackgrass during the growing seasons of 1962 and 1963 was 105, 15 and 60 lb/A of N, P, and K, respectively. Quackgrass shoots harvested at maturity in mid-July had taken up 55, 45, and 68% of the total N, P, and K, respectively, that was removed throughout the season by quackgrass shoots plus rhizomes. It appeared that the early season uptake of N and K by quackgrass may have contributed to, but was not solely responsible for, the reduction in corn height and yield and delayed maturity noted later in the season.
10.2307/4041209|The effect of a,a,a-trifluoro-2,6-dinitro-N,N-dipropyl-p-toluidine (trifluralin) on the growth of cotton seedlings was studied under greenhouse conditions as influenced by dosage, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 lb/A, and depth of soil-incorporation, 0 to 6 in in 0.5-in increments; the cotton seed were planted 1.5 in deep and watering was by subirrigation. Trifluralin caused stunting in height of cotton seedlings and prevention of lateral root growth. The dosage of the chemical influenced the degree and persistence of stunting more than did depth of incorporation. Marked stunting occurred at 1 lb/A at all depths of incorporation and persisted for the duration of the experiments, about 1 month; slight to moderate stunting occurred at 0.75 lb/A or less but was of short duration, 1 to 2 weeks. Lateral root growth was affected more by depth of incorporation than by dosage; though the growth of the taproot was essentially unaffected, the growth of lateral roots was completely prevented by even the lowest dosage applied, 0.25 lb/A, incorporated to the greatest depth, 6 in. Root growth was prevented only along that portion of the taproot growing in treated soil; when trifluralin was incorporated above the seed, root development was unaffected. Stunting occurred independently of the effect on root growth.
10.2307/4041210| Soil incorporation and site of uptake of preemergence herbicides was investigated under greenhouse conditions using green foxtail (Setaria viridis (L.) Beauv.) and the herbicides 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine), 2-chloro-N-isopropylacetanilide (hereinafter referred to as CP31393), 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben), 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methoxy-1-methylurea (linuron), ethyl N,N-dipropylthiolcarbamate (EPTC), and ,,-trifluroro-2,6-dinitro-N,N-dipropyl-p-toluidine (trifluralin). As depth of incorporation of most herbicides was increased, control of green foxtail decreased, indicating a dilution effect. Subsurface application of herbicides at a 2-in depth generally was less than half as effective as surface application or shallow incorporation. With three different moisture conditions, shallow incorporation of trifluralin to depth of 1 in was beneficial at all moisture levels. Shallow incorporation of atrazine and EPTC improved effectiveness under conditions analagous to furrow irrigation but not under conditions simulating moderate or high rainfall immediately after application. Shallow incorporation of the ammonium salt of amiben increased effectiveness significantly under high moisture but decreased effectiveness under low moisture. Effectiveness of linuron was reduced by incorporation under moderate and high moisture. Shallow incorporation did not significantly affect results with CP31393 under any moisture condition. For the six herbicides tested, the expression of lethal action on tops of green foxtail was evident when herbicide was placed in the shoot zone but not when placed in the root zone during the 2-week period after seeding. 
10.2307/4041202|Sixteen field tests conducted over 12 years showed that, under the soil and climatic conditions prevailing in the Peace River region of western Canada, application of maximum rates of 20 lb/A of 2, 2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon) combined with tillage did not kill more than 95% of quackgrass (Agropyron repens (L.) Beauv.). Best treatment was to rejuvenate the quackgrass in the spring by thorough tillage, apply the dalapon when the resprouts were 4 to 6 in tall, till thoroughly again about 2 weeks later, and then till at monthly intervals until freeze-up. The type of implement used was not important, providing the quackgrass rhizomes were thoroughly shredded. With rates of dalapon at or below 20 lb/A, no residual effect occurred on cereal crops planted in the spring following the year of treatment.
10.2307/4041216|The depth of leaching of 3(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron) in a Yolo sandy clay loam soil was altered by the various types-anionic, cationic, or nonionic-of surfactants. The effects of surfactants Aliquat 204 and Aliquat 221 on the leaching of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methoxy-1-methylurea (linuron), 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron), 1-butyl-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methylurea (neburon), and diuron may reflect a sorption complex of the substituted urea herbicide, surfactant, and the soil. This sorption appears to be closely associated with the dilauryl portion of the surfactant molecule. Other surfactants of the Aliquat series containing lauryl, dioctyl, and distearyl substitutions had little or no effect on this sorption phenomenon.
10.2307/4041217|Differences in degree of seed dormancy were shown to exist both among and within the four varieties of wild oats (Avena fatua L. spp. fatua (L.) Thell.) occurring in natural infestations throughout southwestern Alberta. Among the varieties, pilosissima was the most dormant, intermedia was more dormant than vilis, and glabrata possessed about the same dormancy as intermedia. Dormancy was overcome more rapidly under dry storage in vilis and glabrata than in intermedia and pilosissima. Seed dormancy of most collections made in 1959 differed from that of collections made at the same locations in 1962, being both higher and lower by as much as 40% in either of the varieties vilis or intermedia. In seeds from plants grown as transplants at three sites, dormancy differed within varieties, but there was no consistent pattern of difference evident among sites.
10.2307/4041222|Plots planted to corn (Zea mays L. var. Mo. 880) were treated with 0, 2.5, 5, and 10 lb/A of 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) or 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) plus 0, 100, or 200 lb/A of nitrogen fertilizer. Yields of corn forage harvested 5 weeks after planting were significantly reduced by herbicidal treatments. Reductions were more pronounced on corn treated with simazine than with atrazine. In a given year, yields of corn forage from each successive harvest were reduced less, percentagewise, than the previous ones. Yields of corn grain generally were unaffected by herbicidal treatments, except when 10 lb/A of simazine were applied. Herbicides caused an increase in percent nitrate in forage approximately 5 weeks after treatment. Percent of nitrogen in corn forage rose sharply, approximately 5 weeks after planting, due to herbicidal treatments, especially on plots not treated with nitrogen fertilizer.
10.2307/4041207|Treatments made at 2-week intervals on guava (Psidium guajava L.) with a 1:1 ratio of butoxyethanol esters of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid:2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D:2,4,5-T) have shown it to be more susceptible when treatments are made during the wet season than during the dry season. Greater susceptibility is related to a plant condition characterized by many new leaves but little or no terminal twig elongation. A similar pattern of defoliation response is caused by 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (dicamba) and 2,3,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram) as by 2,4-D:2,4,5-T, but the period of maximum susceptibility based on defoliation percentages 1 year after treatment occurred later in the season.
10.2307/4041218|Amitrole (3-amino-1,2,4-triazole) is absorbed and actively bound to non-physiological sites in Salmonella typhimurium. Accumulation of amitrole is inhibited by purines; but the effect does not seem to explain adenine protection against growth inhibition by amitrole. Guanine, xanthine, and hypoxanthine cannot replace adenine in growth protection but do inhibit accumulation of amitrole in the bacterial cells.
10.2307/4041219|Subsurface application of liquid or granular formulations of ethyl N,N-dipropylthiocarbamate (EPTC) at planting time effectively controlled annual grass weed species in new seedlings of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.). Control of annual broadleaf weeds by EPTC was incomplete. A postemergence application of 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)butyric acid (2,4-DB) in addition to the EPTC treatment resulted in excellent overall weed control. Benefits of weed control were more evident in birdsfoot trefoil than alfalfa.
10.2307/4041225|Effect of 3,5-dimethyltetrahydro-1,3,5,2H-thiadiazine-2-thione (DMTT) on the growth of Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) seedlings was studied at constant levels of soil moisture maintained by capillary fringes. A high content of water depressed the growth of plants but preserved their normal morphological balance. A low content of water produced succulent seedlings with inferior root systems. The results suggest that DMTT is better adapted to fine-textured soils with restricted aeration. Maintenance of water supply at field capacity of the soil also may improve the balance of nursery stock and its survival potential.
10.2307/4041200|Thiobacillus thioparus, Azotobacter chroococcum, Rhizobium leguminosarum, Aspergillus niger, Paramecium caudatum, Colpidium sp., and a mixed culture of soil ciliates were not adversely influenced nor stimulated by the presence of dimethyl 2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalate (DCPA). Soil from plots treated 7 years at 5.0 ppm showed no accumulation of DCPA. Plate counts of actinomyces, bacteria, and molds from field and laboratory-treated soils showed no adverse effect. A mixed culture of soil algae and fungi grew significantly more in the presence of DCPA.
10.2307/4041201|The selective properties of 5-amino-4-chloro-2-phenyl-3-(2H)-pyridazinone (pyrazon), a new herbicide for the control of weeds in sugar beets, were investigated. Common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.), redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), and green and yellow foxtail (Setaria viridis (L.) Beauv. and S. glauca (L.) Beauv.) represented about 77% of the weeds emerging and developing with beets. The preemergence rate of 4 to 5 lb/A pyrazon satisfactorily controlled the two broadleaf weed species but was marginal in controlling foxtail. At 6 and 7 1/2 lb/A, beet stands were reduced; however, because of the standard practice of overseeding, normal stands were possible and yields of roots and extractable sugar were unaffected. Preemergence applications of aqueous suspensions of pyrazon were more satisfactory than postemergence. The addition of miscible non-phytotoxic oils or adjuvants to aqueous mixtures greatly improved the postemergence activity of pyrazon. In spite of the occasional temporary beet injury, beets in the two to four-leaf stage seemed relatively tolerant to postemergence treatments. Control was excellent when weeds were treated in the seedling stage (i.e. between cotyledon and four true leaves).
10.2307/4041227|A truck sprayer for applying herbicides to brush is described. It consists of a three-section, hydraulically controlled boom capable of spraying about a 22-ft swath on brush up to 12 ft tall. The spraying system is mounted on a 3/4-T truck equipped with additional lights for night spraying. Plots 22 ft wide by 50 to 200 ft long are sprayed.
10.2307/4041212| Postemergence application of isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate (CIPC) killed small seedlings or redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), large crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis L.), and pale smartweed (Polygonum lapathifolium L.). However, the apparent mode of action in redroot pigweed and large crabgrass was different from that in pale smartweed. The first two species showed injury symptoms 1 to 2 days after spraying, while the effect of the herbicide on pale smartweed was slow and no growth inhibition was observed until about 2 weeks after application. Injury symptoms of smartweed were different from those of the other two species. Tolerance of redroot pigweed and large crabgrass to CIPC increased rapidly with age. Studies on respiration, CO fixation, and chlorophyll content showed that the fast action in redroot pigweed and large crabgrass was accompanied by a reduction in photosynthesis, decrease in chlorophyll content, and increase in respiration. In pale smartweed, where slow action of CIPC took place, there was no change in carbon dioxide fixation, chlorophyll content, or oxygen uptake until about 2 weeks after spraying, when symptoms of this type of action were first observed. 
10.2307/4041204|A laboratory assay method was developed for studying pricklypear (Opuntia sp.) responses to herbicides. Herbicidal translocation from one pad to another and lateral translocation across a pad appeared to be very slight. Pads were killed when a butoxy ethanol ester, a propylene glycol butyl ether ester, or a 2-ethylhexyl ester formulation of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) was applied to only one side. Increasing temperatures from 21 to 43 C increased the rate of killing pads. Concentrations of 2,4,5-T at 8 lb aehg of solution usually killed the pad at temperatures above 21 C. Concentrations of 2,4,5-T at 4 lb aehg or less had little effect on the pads. Relative humidity level had little effect on 2,4,5-T activity, but the activity of a propylene glycol butyl ether ester of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) was more effective at the 90 to 95% level than at levels ranging from 30 to 75%. Water, diesel oil, and three diesel oil:water mixtures had little effect on 2,4,5-T toxicity. More toxic effects were shown by 2,4,5-T than 2,4-D. The propylene glycol butyl ether ester, the butoxy ether ester, and the 2-ethylhexyl ester of 2,4,5-T were equally effective on pricklypear at the same concentrations.
10.2307/4041220|Prior to planting of birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.), stony soils were sprayed with ethyl N,N-dipropylthiocarbamate (EPTC) at 0, 2.0, or 4.0 lb/A and were tandem-disked or harrowed 0, 1, 2, or 3 times or rotary-tilled to incorporate the herbicide. Rotary tillage was the best incorporation method where stones were not numerous. Tandem disking was the most practical. Annual grasses were controlled by 2.0 lb/A EPTC and one incorporation. Higher rates of EPTC and more incorporations resulted in better annual broadleaf weed control and increased yields of birdsfoot trefoil.
10.2307/4041221|The herbicides 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T), and 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (dicamba) each labeled in the carboxyl position were sprayed on a pasture consisting of a mixture of silver beardgrass (Andropogon saccharoides Swartz), little bluestem (A. scoparius Michx.), and dallisgrass (Paspalum dilatatum Poir.) and a sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula [Michx.] Torr.) pasture over a 3-year period. Plant samples were harvested at intervals between 1 hr and 16 weeks after treatment and residues determined by radioassay. No important differences were found in the persistence of herbicides or of different formulations of the same herbicide. Rainfall was the most important factor influencing the persistence of the herbicides. The little bluestem-silver beardgrass-dallisgrass samples harvested 1 hr after treatment with the butoxyethyl ester of 2,4,5-T contained both this ester and the acid of 2,4,5-T. One week after treatment, the acid of 2,4,5-T and unknown metabolites were found but no ester.
10.2307/4041203|Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) yields were correlated negatively with weed yields and positively with stover yields, sorghum heads per plant, and sorghum weight per 1000 seeds. Sorghum yields were not different when weeds were removed 1, 2, or 3 weeks after planting and each week thereafter, but a significant yield decrease occurred each week when weeds were not removed for 4, 5, 6, or 8 weeks. Sorghum kept weed-free the first 4 weeks after planting showed little yield loss from weeds emerging later. Weeds left after two cultivations reduced sorghum yields 38% below plots weeded weekly. As weed competition increased, sorghum grain yield, stover yield, sorghum heads per plant, seed weight per head, and weight per 1000 seeds decreased, whereas sorghum seed moisture at harvest increased.
10.2307/4041226|Growth of Oxalis cernua Thunb. was determined in different temperature regimes. Growth occurred in the 55 to 75 F range. Temperature variation promoted growth. Bulbs sprouted more rapidly and uniformly after storage at 35 F than after storage at 95 F. The weed probably is best adapted to areas with winter soil temperatures between 55 and 75 F.
10.2307/4041224|Damping-off of pea (Pisum sativum) seedlings in autoclaved soil subsequently inoculated with Pythium debaryanum ATCC 9998 grown in potato dextrose broth in presence of 75 ppmw O-(2,4-dichlorophenyl) O-methyl isopropylphosphoramidothioate (DMPA) was not different than in soil inoculated with the fungus grown in potato dextrose broth without DMPA. Damping-off of pea seedlings was less in autoclaved soil subsequently inoculated with Pythium debaryanum ATCC 9998 and to which DMPA (100 ppmw) had been added than in inoculated soil with no DMPA present. Damping-off of pea seedlings germinated in soil from plots that had received annual applications of DMPA, 15 lb/A, was nearly as great as that in the control plots.
10.2307/4041215|The potassium salt of 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram) was applied as soil, foliar, and soil plus foliar treatments to defoliated and non-defoliated huisache (Acacia farnesiana (L.) Willd) grown in the greenhouse. Soil applications of 1/8 lb/A were more effective than foliar treatments. However, soil or foliar applications at 1/2 lb/A were lethal on non-defoliated plants. Defoliated plants treated with 1/2 lb/A showed considerable regrowth, indicating that leaves were important for absorption and movement of the herbicide into stem and root tissues. Plants treated with 1/4 lb/A of picloram and defoliated after 0, 4, 10, and 24 hr indicated that 24 hr were necessary to obtain maximum herbicidal effectiveness. Picloram content was determined in the leaves, upper stem, lower stem, and roots by gas chromatographic analysis, 3, 10, and 30 days after treatment. Most of the picloram applied to foliage was found in and on the leaves 30 days after treatment. The upper stem contained several times more picloram than the lower stem. No detectable amounts of picloram were found in the leaves and upper stem 3 and 30 days after soil treatment. The concentration of picloram in roots from soil applications was similar to foliar treatments. Absorption and movement studies showed that a period of 24 hr was required to move lethal amounts of picloram into stem and root tissues of huisache after foliar treatments.
10.2307/4040632|The use of insects in the biological control of weeds necessitates that these insects have very restricted host ranges. Specialized insects boring in stems or living in seed pods have adaptations which obligate them to their host plant. However, the leaf-feeding beetle, Chrysolina quadrigemina Suffrian, imported for the control of St. Johnswort (Klamath weed) (Hypericum perforatum L.) through its feeding habits, tropistic responses and synchronization of its life history to the growth phases of the plant has shown that it is restricted to its preferred host plant.
10.2307/4040631|Bristly thistle (Cirsium horridulum Michx.) is an important perennial weed in Alabama pastures. It may remain vegetative many years before flowering and may regrow from the roots after flowering. A heavily infested pasture produced about 10,000 seedlings per acre per year of which 73% established from January through April. There was an average of 150 achenes per head but many did not contain fully developed seed. Essentially equal numbers of red and yellow flowered types were found. From two to as many as six successive cuttings below the soil surface were necessary to kill thistle plants. Thistles were effectively controlled by 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA).
10.2307/4040642|Marked differences in the response of field bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis L.) to 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) were found among plants grown from seed obtained from 19 states in the U. S. and one province in Canada. These differences were not correlated with the origin nor with plant vigor. Inherent physiological differences seemed to be responsible.
10.2307/4040635|The toxicity of 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) and 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isoproylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) to eight crops was determined. The crops in order of increasing tolerance to these herbicides were Southern Giant Curled mustard (Brassica juncea (L.) Coss.), Missouri 0-205 oats, Straight Eight cucumbers (Cucurbita sativa L.), Knox wheat, Clark soybeans, RS610 grain sorghum, GT-112 inbred corn, and F-6 inbred corn. Inactivation of simazine and atrazine applied at 2 lb/A on field plots, as determined by soybean and oat bioassay, was most rapid when the soil environment was favorable for the growth of microorganisms. Very little inactivation occurred between September, 1960, and June, 1961, following a May, 1960 application. One year after application, 0.16 lb/A of atrazine and 0.31 lb/A of simazine were detected, but neither was detected after 16 months.
10.2307/4040638|2-chloro-4-isopropylamino-6-ethylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) applied at 3 lb/A to wheat stubble shortly after harvest in 1961 and 1962 controlled all vegetation for the remainder of the season. 2-chloro-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (propazine) was nearly as effective as atrazine in 1962. Grain sorghum was planted in the spring of 1962. No preplanting tillage was used, and no weed control measures were needed in sorghum during the growing season on the treated plots, and crop stands, vigor, and grain yields were superior to those on the cultivated checks.
10.2307/4040640|Two lines of corn (Zea mays L.)-one, GT112 RfRf, resistant to 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) and 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine), and the other, GT112, susceptible to both-were used. Both glucose and sucrose, supplied to the treated plant through a severed leaf tip, were found to protect GT112 from the toxic effect of atrazine and simazine. Glucose gave a slightly better protection. Oxygen uptake in excised roots of GT112 treated with atrazine gradually declined with age until death, while leaf discs of treated and untreated lines showed no distinct trend in oxygen uptake. Atrazine decreased root respiration in GT112 but had no effect on that of GT112 RfRf. Root respiration in untreated GT112 was higher than in untreated GT112 RfRf. Atrazine decreased leaf respiration when both lines were considered.
10.2307/4040633| A single-gene homozygous recessive mutant in an S inbred line of corn resulted in an 8- to 10-fold reduction in 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one content. Aqueous suspensions of acetone extracts from low segregates formed little 2-hydroxy-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (hydroxysimazine) when incubated with 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine). Tolerance studies on 3:1 and 1:1 segregating ears indicated that the low segregates were somewhat less tolerant to 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) supplied in solution culture. 
10.2307/4040645|A tractor-mounted experimental plot sprayer for applying herbicides is described.
10.2307/4040639|Seeds of largeseed dodder (Cuscuta indecora, Choisy), field dodder (Cuscuta campestris, Yuncker), and small-seeded dodder (Cuscuta approximata, Bab.) were studied on the basis of (1) germination at different temperatures, and (2) spring emergence of seedlings as related to soil temperature. Small-seeded dodder germinated at 35 to 45 F with maximum germination at 60 F. Largeseed dodder germinated very little and field dodder not at all below 50 F. They germinated best at 60 F and above. Dodder seeds were planted outside at different depths in a sandy loam soil during the autumns of two years. Daily counts on seedling emergence during the spring showed that small-seeded dodder was first to germinate, at a soil temperature of 39 F, largeseed dodder emerged from 7 to 10 days later at a soil temperature of 51 F, and field dodder emerged 2 to 4 days still later. Very few seedlings of the small-seeded dodder emerged after mid-May, but largeseed and field dodders continued to emerge throughout the summer.
10.2307/4040641| Metabolism of C-labeled and unlabeled atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine) was studied in oats, soybeans, and beans (susceptible); cotton and peanuts (intermediate in susceptibility); and Johnsongrass, grain sorghum, and corn (resistant). Atrazine residues were found in all plants 11 days after a preemergence application of 1 lb atrazine/A. Methanol was found to be a better extraction solvent for atrazine and hydroxyatrazine than chloroform. Undegraded atrazine found in plants was roughly correlated with susceptibility, but atrazine absorption was not directly correlated with plant susceptibility. Radioactivity remaining in plant residue after methanol extraction likewise was not completely correlated with susceptibility. All plants converted some atrazine to hydroxyatrazine and the amount of hydroxyatrazine formed was somewhat correlated with resistance. The three resistant species converted at least twice as much atrazine to hydroxyatrazine as did the susceptible soybean and oats. Beans converted considerably larger amounts of atrazine than did other susceptible species. 
10.2307/4040624|Four concentrations of 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron), 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron), 1-n-butyl-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methylurea (neburon) and 3-phenyl-1,1-dimethylurea (fenuron), adsorbed on photometrically uniform filter paper, were irradiated with ultraviolet light 253.7 millimicrons) or sunlight. Marked changes in the absorption spectra after irradiation indicated photodecomposition of the four herbicides was different with the two light sources.
10.2307/4040625|Recrystallized 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine), 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine), and 2-methylmercapto-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (ametryne) were adsorbed on filter paper, and exposed to ultraviolet light (253.7 millimicrons) or sunlight. All underwent photodecomposition, which was different under ultraviolet light and sunlight.
10.2307/4040630|Strains of hoary cress, particularly within the lens-podded species (Cardaria chalepensis (L.) Hand.-Maz.), varied greatly in leaf size and shape, spreading ability, stand density, and reaction to treatment with several herbicides. Without competition, heart-podded hoary cress (C. draba (L.) Desv.) spread farther and produced a denser stand than either lens-podded or globe-podded cress (C. pubescens (K. A. Meyer) Jarm.), and, in general, was more susceptible to 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA) than lens-podded cress. Within 12 strains of lens-podded hoary cress no relationship was found between susceptibility to 2,4-D or 2,3,6-TBA and any other characteristic.
10.2307/4040629|Collections of plants of medusahead, Elymus caputmedusae L., were made from natural infestations in Nez Perce County and Washington County in northern and southern Idaho, respectively. The ash and silica content (dry weight basis) decreased as the plant matured. The total ash of the entire plant contained from 72-89 per cent silica. Similar percentages of silica in ash were obtained in the culms, heads, and seeds of the plant. X-ray diffraction patterns and polarizing microscope examinations showed the mineral form of silica to be opal. Heavy deposition of silica was found in the barbs of awns, in the epidermis of the leaves, culms, glumes and seeds, and in strands beneath the epidermis.
10.2307/4040637|Flat pea (Lathyrus sylvestris L.), previously investigated as a forage plant in the United States, is a perennial legume with undesirable qualities of low palatability, difficulty of establishment, and a toxic principle. Characteristically aggressive and tolerant to a wide range of growth conditions, it is a potentially serious weed in its area of adaptation. A related species, everlasting pea (L. latifolius L.), has similar characteristics. A 2-lb/A rate of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T), 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid (silvex), or 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA) followed by 2-lb/A of silvex a year later gave complete control of established plants and seedlings of flat pea.
10.2307/4040643| A grass seed attachment to a grain drill was modified to apply granular herbicides using positive metering mechanism. Uniformity of granule output was adjusted within  4% maximum error. Speed of travel did not appreciably affect the amount of granules applied per acre. 
10.2307/4040647|Catalase and peroxidase activities were run at several ages on two lines of corn (Zea mays L.)-GT112 RfRf, resistant, and GT112, susceptible to 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine). Atrazine significantly decreased catalase activity in GT112, while in treated GT112 RfRf catalase activity was usually significantly increased. Catalase activity was higher in GT112 RfRf than in GT112 for both treatments at all ages. GT112 RfRf had a higher peroxidase activity than GT112 when both were untreated, but when treated with atrazine there was no overall trend.
10.2307/4040644|The resistance of corn to the herbicides, 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine [simazine] and 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine), may be related to stalk rot and corn borer resistance. Of five inbred lines of corn studied, three with known resistance to stalk rot and corn borer were found to be much more resistant to simazine and atrazine than were two inbreds which were susceptible to stalk rot and corn borer.
10.2307/4040626|Amitrole (3-amino-1,2,4-triazole) and 5-chlorobenzo-1,2,3-triazole were the only compounds tested that inhibited wheat root elongation and growth of carrot explants, produced chlorosis, and depressed catalase activity. Ten other heterocyclic compounds were more effective in inhibiting growth in wheat roots or carrot explants. Overall biological activity was reduced when substituents other than the amino group on the number three position were substituted on the triazole nucleus.
10.2307/4040627|Seven different types of nozzles were compared as to uniformity of spray application, spray drift, and tendency to clog. The wide angle whirl chamber nozzles applied the spray more uniformly than other nozzles. Increasing nozzle height to 1.5 times the recommended height increased uniformity of spray application with most nozzles. Lowering the nozzle height to half the recommended height seriously reduced uniformity of spray application with almost all nozzles except the wide angle whirl chamber nozzles which provided a uniform spray at all 3 heights. The whirl chamber nozzles were least easily clogged of the nozzles studied. Wettable powders normally applied in 30 gallons or more per acre have been satisfactorily applied at rates of less than 1/4 of this amount. Spray drift was reduced to a no crop hazard level, with effective coverage, at rates of application as low as 7 gallons per acre.
10.2307/4040636|The alkanolamine salt of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), the dimethylamine salt of 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA), and the sodium salt of 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid (fenac), were evaluated in controlling witchweed and toxicity to corn on germinating seed in petri dishes, as preplanting, preemergence, and postemergence treatments in the greenhouse and as preplanting, soil-incorporated treatments in the field. Corn roots were affected more than the shoots by each herbicide. Fenac and 2,4-D inhibited root growth of corn seedlings in petri dishes more than 2,3,6-TBA. Fenac was the most effective herbicide for control of witchweed and weedy grasses when applied as a preplanting, soil-incorporated treatment and controlled witchweed at rates which significantly increased corn yields. Applied preplanting, 2,4-D did not control witchweed and 2,3,6-TBA at rates which gave witchweed control equivalent to that obtained with fenac was toxic to corn.
10.2307/4040634| The amount of C-labeled triazine herbicides absorbed by the upper and lower surfaces of peanut (Arachis hypogea) leaves was found to be significant with the exception of 2-methoxy-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (prometone). Almost always a surface active agent increased the absorption of triazine herbicides by the leaves. The surface active agent did not play any role in diffusion of these herbicides. Among the four herbicides tested 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) and 2-methoxy-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (prometone) were found to move both acropetally and basipetally, whereas 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) and 2-chloro-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (propazine) moved only in the acropetal direction. 
10.2307/4040646|Thirteen treatments during a 5-year period with a 1: 1 mixture of the propylene glycol butyl ether esters of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,4-5 trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) were required to eradicate an established stand of kudzu, Pueraria lobata (Willd.) Ohwi.
10.2307/4040628| The rates of decarboxylation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 2-chloro-4-fluorophenoxyacetic acid and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) in excised leaves of blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica Muenchh,) were determined by collecting the CO evolved from carboxyl-labeled herbicides. 2,4,5-T was decarboxylated only in trace amounts. 2,4-D was decarboxylated to a maximum of about 1 per cent and 2-chloro-4-fluorophenoxyacetic acid of about 7 per cent, of the amounts taken up by the leaf. Decarboxylation rates for 2,4-D in June were highest in persimmon (Diospryos virginiana L.) and blackjack oak, and were very low in winged elm (Ulmus alata Michx.), sweet gum (Liquid-ambar styraciflua L.), and green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh.). The rates of decarboxylation of 2,4-D apparently were not correlated with susceptibility to 2,4-D. 
10.2307/4040758| The most promising of 13 herbicides for the control of southern naiad (Najas guadalupensis (Spreng.) Magnus) were acrylaldehyde (acrolein), mono-N,N-dimethylcocoamine and di-N,N-dimethylcocoamine salts of 7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (endothall), 6,7-dihydrodipyrido[1,2-:2,1-c] pyrazidiinium salt (diquat), and 1,1-dimethyl-4,4-bypyridinium salt (paraquat). Acrolein and the 2 alkylamine salts of endothall gave the most rapid kill of southern naiad but retreatment was necessary at the end of 16 weeks. Diquat and paraquat were the 2 most promising materials evaluated. Large scale applications of acrolein, di-N,N-dimethylcocoamine salt of endothall and diquat confirmed these results. Diquat and paraquat were the only herbicides of the 13 that were not toxic to fish. 
10.2307/4040760|Plants of Zebrina pendula L., Phaseolus vulgaris L., Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers., and Chenopodium album L. were sprayed with a solution containing herbicide (sodium 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid or sodium 2,2-dichloropropionic acid), surfactant (sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate), and fluorescent tracer (sodium pyrenetrisulfonate). In most instances plants having stomata relatively open absorbed more tracer (based on UV observation) and more herbicide (based on injury and growth responses) than those with stomata relatively closed. Differences, however, were less than those expected from studies using detached leaves, probably from poorer control of stomatal aperture in intact leaves. There was good agreement between degree of opening and tracer uptake.
10.2307/4040761|Monuron [3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea] and neburon [1-n-butyl-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methylurea] were applied to a sandy loam soil which was planted to several crops in southern California. Monuron at 2, 4, and 8 lb/A and neburon at 2 lb/A were below phytotoxic levels by 12 months. Neburon at 4 lb/A persisted at phytotoxic levels for over 16 months, and at 8 lb/A for over 24 months.
10.2307/4040753|Seeds of winged elm (Ulmus alata Michx.) stored under moist conditions lost viability rapidly. Under dry conditions the seeds lived longer. Winged elm seeds would not germinate at 4 C or 42 C but did at temperatures between these points. Salt concentrations above 20,000 ppm killed the seed; concentrations below this inhibited germination; twelve per cent manitol solutions (16 atmospheres osmotic pressure) prevented germination; pressures lower than this decreasingly affected germination. If the soil moisture level was below 2%, winged elm seeds would not germinate. Removal of the outer husk of the seed did not affect germination. Winged elm seedlings did not emerge if planted at depths below 1/4 inch.
10.2307/4040763|The ribonucleic acid (RNA) content of corn roots and etiolated coleoptiles treated with amitrole (3-amino-1,2,4-triazole) was very similar to that in untreated tissues. Amitrole consistently decreased the acid-soluble nucleotide content of etiolated corn coleoptiles.
10.2307/4040752| The effects of thirteen plant growth regulators and herbicides on glucose absorption, metabolism, and incorporation in pea root tissues were studied. Both indoleacetic acid (IAA) and gibberellic acid (GA) caused no effects, while -naphthaleneacetic acid (-NAA) and -naphthaleneacetic acid (-NAA) caused an increase in catabolic and a decrease in anabolic processes, with the C-1 carbon undergoing the largest change. The absorption of glucose was also inhibited considerably by the synthetic auxins. The carbamates, isopropyl N-phenylcarbamate (IPC), n-Ethyl-N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (EPTC), and 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron) inhibited slightly the glucose absorption. All affected the catabolic process to a certain extent while only IPC caused a change in the anabolic process. Both 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (TBA) and 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) decreased glucose absorption and increased glucose-1-C catabolism. TIBA also affected the anabolic process. Other herbicides, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole), maleic hydrazide (MH), 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine), and 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon) caused varied degrees of inhibition to glucose absorption. Both simazine and dalapon increased C-1 catabolism and exerted no effect on the anabolic process. Only dalapon altered the catabolism of glucose-6-C. Amitrole and MH decreased the over-all catabolic process with no effect on the pathway; both chemicals increased the anabolic process. 
10.2307/4040762|When weeds were controlled in sorghum by handweeding or a herbicide there was no advantage or need for cultivation. Control of weeds in sorghum with preemergence herbicides was feasible, but the combination of cultivation and herbicides gave more dependable weed control than either method used alone. Preemergence applications of 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) were the most effective for controlling weeds and increasing sorghum yields. In decreasing order of effectiveness were 2-chloro-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (propazine), 2-chloro-N,N-diallylacetamide (CDAA) + trichlorobenzyl chloride (TCBC), and postemergence atrazine applications.
10.2307/4040766|If there was no heavy rainfall or surface irrigation before corn emergence, as ethyl-N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (EPTC) at 3 lb/A was incorporated deeper into the soil, more corn plants were injured, the height of plants was reduced, and a loss in weight or yield occurred, although the germination of the corn seed was not affected. Implements used to incorporate EPTC did not produce significantly different amounts of corn injury where used at the same depth.
10.2307/4040748| In short-term studies, diquat (6,7-dihydro-dipyrido(1,2-a:2,1-c) pyrazidiinium salt) and paraquat (1,1-dimethyl-4,4-dipyridinium salt) caused a stimulation in respiration and an inhibition in photosynthesis of duckweed (Lemna minor L.). Atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine) and monuron [3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea] caused inhibition of the Hill reaction at rates lower (10M) than diquat and paraquat (10M), and diquat was considerably more effective than paraquat. The effect of a combination of monuron and diquat on O production was additive. Inhibition of the Hill reaction by these dipyridyliums was directly related to their redox potentials. Autoradiographs of chromatograms and electrochromatograms as well as CO studies indicated that neither diquat nor paraquat was degraded in alligatorweed [Alternanthera philoxeriodes (Mart.) Griseb.] and garden, or snap beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L. var. Black Valentine). 
10.2307/4040747|The nature and mode of action of surfactants is reviewed. Surfactants are useful additives for formulated herbicides because they contribute to wetting, spreading, emulsification, and solubilization of the herbicide. The use of extra surfactant to increase herbicidal activity is a desirable practice. The factors in selecting a suitable agent are discussed in terms of surfactant properties.
10.2307/4040764| The minimum red-light (> 590 m) intensities from fluorescent tubes at which growth or maintenance of original fresh weight were obtained at 20 C in a growth chamber for 28 days were 11-20 foot-candles for waterstargrass (Heteranthera dubia [Jacq.] Mac M.) and 12-45 foot-candles for coontail (Ceratophyllum demersum L.). Duckweed (Lemna minor L.) frond number increased significantly at 45 foot-candles red light, and the fresh weight probably increased at 45 foot-candles. The intensites of 11-45 foot-candles constituted 1.0-3.8 percent of the red portion of full sunlight. 
10.2307/4040751| The fate of the C label in ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiol-carbamate (EPTC) was studied following root uptake by alfalfa plants for periods of 2 and 5 days. The uptake and movement of the C label in alfalfa was demonstrated by means of autoradiographs and measurements of radioactivity with a Geiger-Mller detector. The amount of radioactivity accumulating in plants during the 5-day uptake period was approximately twice the amount accumulating in 2 days. The autoradiographs of plants receiving the 5-day uptake treatment showed an accumulation of C in the youngest tissue. Radioactive CO was liberated by the treated plants and their extracts contained a large number of C labeled compounds. 
10.2307/4040757|All horizontal underground structures were roots and not rhizomes. The small, light-colored feeder roots are short-lived and consist mainly of primary tissue. Only one transition zone per clone was found. This was found in the collet (lower hypocotylary swelling). The transition from exarch, radial stele of the root, to endarch, collateral stele of the upper collet, was complete in approximately 2500 microns. All root primordia examined had endogenous origin from pericycle and pericyclic tissues. Buds arose endogenously in roots but exogenously in the region of the hypocotyl with endarch protoxylem. Primordia were often identified as roots or shoots prior to their emergence from the main axis.
10.2307/4040767|Dimethylarsenic acid (cacodylic acid), 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (dicamba), 2,6-dinitro-N,N-di-n-propyl-alpha-alpha-alpha-trifluoro-p-toluidine (trifluralin), and O-(2-4-dichlorophenyl) O-methyl isopropyl-phosphoramidothioate (DMPA) were tested to determine if they could selectively control nimblewill (Muhlenbergia schreberi J. F. Gmel.) in Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) pasture. DMPA reduced the nimblewill population 95% during the initial year of treament, while other herbicides gave only 61 to 72% reduction. No effect on nimblewill was evident the second year after application. None of the herbicides caused severe or permanent injury to the bluegrass.
10.2307/4040754| Stationary and portable field sampling equipment and techniques are described for the collection of gaseous and aerosol forms of 2,4-D compounds. Air was sampled at the rate of 1 liter per minute through 10 ml of n-decane in a modified midget impinger maintained at approximately 1 C. Field sampling was conducted at two eastern Washington sites for approximately 106 days during the summer of 1963. The presence of isopropyl, butyl, and isooctyl esters of 2,4-D in the atmosphere was established by electron capture gas chromatography. Twenty-four hour average atmospheric concentrations of these esters ranged from undetectable to 3.1 g/m. 
10.2307/4040750|Application of 20 to 40 lb/A dichlobenil made prior to emergence accomplished various degrees of control of pondweeds (Potamogeton diversifolius, P. foliosus, P. pectinatus, P. pusillus) and a slender naiad (Najas flexilis). Coontail (Ceratophyllum demersum) was affected only by the higher dosage. Limited control and growth inhibition was achieved on several forms of algae in early spring applications. However, applications made to rooted submersed aquatic plants and filamentous algae (Cladophora, Pithophora and Chara) at postemergence stage of development had little herbicidal effect. Dichlobenil was not acutely toxic to fish at herbicidal concentrations. The range of median tolerance limits was 10 to 20 ppmw for pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus), bluegill (L. macrochirus), redear sunfish (L. microlophus), and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides).
10.2307/4040759|Saltcedar (Tamarix pentandra Pall.) and Woods rose (Rosa woodsii Lindl. var. ultramontana [Wats.] Jeps.) were sprayed with systemic herbicides at frequent intervals over a 2-year period. Root samples were collected at each spray date and analyzed for "total available carbohydrates." Food reserve levels in the roots and response to herbicides were not correlated.
10.2307/4040749|Selections of wild oats (Avena fatua L.) had varying degrees of resistance to isopropyl N-phenylcarbamate (IPC). Strains with gray glabrous lemmas and non-dormant seed tended to be more resistant to IPC than those with brown pubescent lemmas and dormant seed.
10.2307/4040746|Selected, representative research on surfactants, herbicide penetration, and plant cuticles was reviewed briefly. New evidence was presented that surfactants influence the activity of herbicides in oil sprays as spectacularly as in aqueous sprays. Most of the experimental facts about surfactants were integrated in a blanketing theory for entry of herbicides by separate hydrophilic and lipophilic pathways.
10.2307/4040765|After 10 months, diphenamid residues were found throughout the 0-9 inch soil depth. In silt loam soils under climatic conditions prevailing in and around the bluegrass region of Kentucky, diphenamid residues in soils may be present at phytotoxic levels in the plow layer 10-11 months after application at rates required for weed control in tobacco.
10.2307/4040756|Greenhouse experiments showed that monuron, 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea, uniformly applied to the soil surface immediately after planting, was about twice as toxic to seedling cotton as was diuron, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea. Phytotoxicity was increased when either of these herbicides was applied with either of the systemic insecticides phorate, O,O-diethyl S-(ethylthio) methyl phosphorodithioate or Di-syston, O,O,-diethyl S-[2-(ethylthio) ethyl] phosphorodithioate.
10.2307/4040745|In the last few years the possibility of growing small fruits and several vegetable crops without any soil disturbance has been demonstrated. On many soil types crop yield has been unaffected and has sometimes shown a slight increase compared with traditional cultivation. Advantages of non-cultivation include the possibility of increasing crop uniformity and yield by using closer row spacings and completely new methods of crop production, the avoidance of injury to surface-feeding roots, decreased risk of frost and easier mechanical harvesting of some crops. In small-fruit plantations the weed problem has greatly diminished after about 3 years, because of non-disturbance of seeds lying below the germinating zone and the absence of a "seed-bed". While the surface crust that sometimes forms where the soil is not disturbed may affect plant growth in certain circumstances, no evidence was obtained in recent experiments in Britain that a crust was detrimental to the growth of established plants. However, water infiltration on bare non-cultivated soil was sometimes retarded and increased run-off occurred on sloping sites. Due to the wide diversity of soil types, climatic conditions and crop response it is impossible to generalize about the effect of eliminating cultivation. Nevertheless, as some of the advantages are considerable while the disadvantages can often be overcome it seems likely that non-cultivation practice will extend to many horticultural crops in the future.
10.2307/4040755|Seed of common cattail (Typha latifolia L.) germinated 100 percent when the blunt ends of the seed coats were ruptured. Seedlings developed primarily while submersed in water. Growth of the seedlings was rapid. A single plant in 6 months developed a network of rhizomes covering an area 10 feet in diameter. Pistillate spikes 7 inches long produced an average of over 222,000 seeds.
10.2307/4040614|Band applications of residual preemergence herbicides were equal to timely shallow cultivations for the control of annual weeds in corn, and were superior when wet weather delayed or interfered with early shallow cultivations. The average corn yield reduction of 7.4 bushels per acre from weed competition observed over a 13 year period, suggested that under average conditions the net cost of herbicide treatment would be less than the value of corn lost through failure to control weeds.
10.2307/4040604|Preemergence herbicides for the control of crabgrass, (Digitaria ischaemum (Schreb.) Muhl. and D. sanguinalis (L.) Scop.) were applied on bluegrass sod at three different rates for three years to determine residual effects on the stand and vigor of perennial ryegrass, red fescue, tall fescue, and Merion and common Kentucky bluegrass seedlings. With few exceptions, the herbicides retarded stand and vigor of these turfgrasses seeded in turf killed with methyl bromide. Chlordane was least and a commercial arsenic complex plus 7% N most toxic to young seedlings. Seedlings of Merion Kentucky bluegrass were most resistant to herbicide injury. No appreciable decrease in original turf density was noted except for the arsenic complex material which severely injured bluegrass turf at the two heavier rates. Germination of the same turfgrasses seeded in flats of sterilized soil in the greenhouse 1 day, 41 days, and 93 days after the application of preemergence crabgrass herbicides, showed the most reduction in emergence from treatments with DMPA [O-(2,4-dichlorophenyl) O-methyl isopropylphosphoramidoate], trifluralin (2,6-dinitro-N,N-di-n-propyl-alpha-alpha-alpha-trifluro-p-toluidine), DCPA (2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalic acid), and dipropalin (N,N-di-n-propyl-2,6-dinitro-p-toluidine). Lead arsenate was least injurious to germinating seedlings. Tall and red fescue were more tolerant to herbicides than the other grasses studied.
10.2307/4040611| The adsorption of herbicides from aqueous solution by muck (organic soil), bentonite, an anion exchanger, and a cation exchanger was studied. The nature of the adsorbent, pH, and temperature all influenced adsorption, and different herbicides responded differently to changes in these factors. Lowering of the pH resulted in increased adsorption by bentonite of all of the herbicides studied, except 6,7-dihydrodipyrido (1,2-a: 2, 1-c) pyrazidiinium salt (diquat) which was completely adsorbed at both a high and a low pH. The influence of pH was greatest for 4,6-dinitro-o-sec-butylphenol (DNBP) and 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine). The DNBP was adsorbed by an anion exchanger, but not by a cation exchanger, while isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamate (CIPC), 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron), and atrazine were adsorbed by both. Diquat was completely adsorbed by the cation exchanger and only slightly by the anion exchanger. All were adsorbed by muck but to verying extents as follows: diquat > CIPC > DNBP > monuron > atrazine. No relationship was found between water solubility and adsorption. Adsorption by bentonite (pH 8.5) was much greater at 0C than at 50C, but adsorption by muck was the same at both temperatures. Desorption studies were conducted using C-labeled atrazine, monuron, 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine), 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben), and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). Repeated extractions with distilled water desorbed these herbicides from bentonite and muck and their desorption was more readily accomplished from bentonite than from muck. 
10.2307/4040613| Results of studies with microorganisms suggest that 5-bromo-3-isopropyl-6-methyluracil (isocil) does not interfere appreciably with pyrimidine metabolism. Instead the uracil herbicides studied appear to act in higher plants as inhibitors of photosynthesis. Strong inhibition of the Hill reaction of isolated chloroplasts by substituted uracils was noted I of 2.7  10 M for isocil). Exogenously supplied carbohydrates partially nullified toxicity symptoms in intact barley plants growing in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of isocil. 
10.2307/4040597| Derivative of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), type of bottom sorbent, and application concentration affected the rate and quantity of 2,4-D released into water from attapulgite granules. All three factors were temperature dependent. Temperature, granule size, and solution pH affected the rate during short exposure periods, but not the total quantity of release of herbicide during 256 hours. Generally, decrease in temperature was associated with a decrease in rate of release of 2,4-D. Decrease in granule size slightly increased the rate of release. Increased acidity reduced the rate of release of 2,4-D acid. Types of attapulgite granules were not significantly different. Rates of subaqueous release of eleven granular herbicides were measured at concentrations of 10, 15, and 20 g ai/ml. Compounds tested were 2,4-D and its butoxyethanol ester (BE), propylene glycol butyl ether ester (PGBE), and isooctyl ester (IOE) derivatives, tris-(2,4-dichlorophenoxyethyl)phosphite, the IOE of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, the BE, PGBE, and potassium salt of 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid (silvex), the sodium salt of 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid, and 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid (fenac). The rate of release of herbicides from granules varied from complete release of silvex potassium salt in 4 hours to less than 10 per cent release of 2,4-D IOE in 256 hours. 
10.2307/4040610|Volunteer wheat and downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.) were consistently controlled by aerial applications of granular 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) without supplemental tillage. Injury to winter wheat seeded in the fall 13 and 14 months after application of atrazine has occurred. Plots aerially treated with 2 lb/A atrazine produced yields comparable to the check but plots treated with 4 lb/A atrazine produced no wheat. Use of persistent herbicides for chemical fallow must be restricted until further knowledge is obtained.
10.2307/4040600| Volatilities of 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine [simazine], 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine [atrazine], 2-chloro-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine [propazine], 2-methoxy-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine [prometone], 2-ethylamino-4-isopropylamino-6-methylmercapto-s-triazine [ametryne], 2,4-bis-(isopropylamino)-6-methylmercapto-s-triazine [prometryne], and 2-chloro-4-diethylamino-6-ethylamino-s-triazine [trietazine] were studied at different temperatures. In descending order at 25 C the relative volatilities of the herbicides from nickel-plated planchets were prometone  trietazine > atrazine  ametryne  prometryne >propazine  simazine. Prometone losses from five soils appeared to be directly related to per cent sand and inversely related to per cent clay and organic matter. Atrazine and simazine losses from the same soils appeared to be less influenced by soil properties than prometone. All seven s-triazines were examined at one temperature on wet and dry Tifton loamy sand. Moisture level affected both the amount of compound lost and the relative order of loss among compounds. Conversion of atrazine and prometone to their corresponding hydroxy analogues was a practical method for preventing vapor losses from planchets. 
10.2307/4040606| Relative vaporization losses of five C ring-labeled 2-chloro-4,6-alkylamino-s-triazines were studied at 25 and 60 C. Herbicide solutions in 95% ethanol were deposited on metal planchets, dried and counted at intervals. The herbicides, ranked in order of decreasing volatility, were: trietazine (2-chloro-4-diethylamino-6-ethylamino-s-triazine), ipazine (2-chloro-4-diethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine), atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine), propazine (2-chloro-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine) and simazine (2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine). Prometone (2-methoxy-4,6-bis (isopropylamino)-s-triazine) and the 2-hydroxy analogues of simazine and propazine, dissolved in water at pH 2-3 (HCl) before plating, showed no detectible loss in 25 hours at 60 C. Foliar penetration and acute toxicity following drop application of the five 2-chloro-triazines and prometone to corn, soybean, tomato, cotton, oat and sorghum appeared to be correlated with their water solubilities. A surfactant tended to enhance activity. Important differences were noted among species, although apparently not related to inherent herbicidal tolerance or susceptibility. Tomato was most sensitive to acute toxicity; soybean cotyledons were least permeable. Basipetal translocation was negligible under all conditions (e.g. 6 herbicides, 6 species, 2 solvents, with or without a surfactant). The 2-hydroxy analogues tended to translocate downward but appeared restricted by acute, acid (pH 2-3) destruction of the transport mechanism. Acropetal (apoplastic) movement of all compounds occurred readily with transpiration, reflecting the vasculature of the species. All 2-chlorotriazines and prometone (but not the two 2-hydroxy compounds) showed pronounced accumulation of C in the lysigenous glands of cotton. Root uptake and distribution of C within the plant body occurred generally for all compounds and species. 
10.2307/4040598|Mixtures of CDAA + atrazine or propazine applied preemergence gave excellent grass and non-grass weed control and no sorghum injury. Such mixtures offer promise of more consistent weed control than either component alone and less soil residue than a higher rate of atrazine or propazine alone. CDAA + trichlorobenzyl chloride preemergence was a less effective mixture but gave better grass weed control and poorer non-grass control than propazine or atrazine pre- or postemergence. Atrazine or propazine postemergence following CDAA preemergence gave excellent results. The best time to spray sorghum with atrazine or propazine between planting and the 11-leaf stage was when the weeds were in the very early postemergence stage. Sorghum was tolerant at all times of application. Atrazine over all trials averaged superior to propazine as an herbicide for grain sorghum.
10.2307/4040612|Yield reductions from the heaviest stand of smooth pigweed (Amaranthus hybridus L.) averaged 39% for corn and 55% for soybeans. For corn the increase in pigweed dry matter about equalled the decrease in the dry matter from the crop; the total dry matter yield was relatively constant. Pigweed grew taller than soybeans, and the dry weight of crop plus pigweeds was 1 1/3 times that of weed-free soybeans. As stand of pigweed was increased, there was a decrease in yield of grain, cobs and stalks or straw, diameter of cornstalks, height of crop, and soybean pods per plant. Yield reductions obtained emphasize the importance of both chemical and cultural measures for reducing competition between row crops and weeds.
10.2307/4040605|When applied in enough water to wet tubes of dry Pullman silty clay loam top soil to a depth of 22 inches, dimethylamine salts of 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA) and polychlorobenzoic acid (PBA) were leached to about 20 inches; an amine salt of 2,4-dichlorophenozyacetic acid (2,4-D) and the sodium salt of 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid (fenac) leached to 15 inches; esters of fenac, 3-phenyl-1,1-dimethylurea (fenuron), 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron) and amine salts of 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyl)propionic acid (silvex) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) leached to approximately 9 inches. Esters of silvex, 2,4,5-T, and 2,4-D remained in the top 3 inches of soil. The leaching with additional water was in the same general order as just given.
10.2307/4040603|Complete control of established plants of absinth wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) was obtained with a single application of borax derivatives at 650 lb/A or less. Of several phenoxyacetic, benzoic, and borax compounds which were tested, the most effective, economical treatment was 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). Competition from perennial grasses was beneficial. Fall tillage prevented the establishment of absinth seedlings, and intensive tillage during the summerfallow year eradicated established plants.
10.2307/4040608|Movement of 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (dicamba) and N,N-dimethyl-2,2-diphenylacetamide (diphenamid) in Hagerstown silty clay was greater with either 5 or 10 surface inches of water when the water was applied in 0.25-inch increments rather than 1-inch. Upward movement of these herbicides occurred under sub-irrigation and when surface-applied water was allowed to evaporate freely from the soil surface. Dicamba always moved more readily than diphenamid. The results indicate that weather patterns may be important in addition to total rainfall in determining the movement of herbicides in soil.
10.2307/4040602|The persistence of soil-surface applied ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate [EPTC] was studied at air velocities of 3/4 to 4 mph in special air-flow equipment. Persistence was inversely related to velocity though the effect was quantitatively changed by soil composition and the materials used in formulating the EPTC spray.
10.2307/4040619|Birdsfoot trefoil, timothy, and sterile pea plants treated with 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy) butyric acid [4-(2,4-DB)], formed 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) to about the same extent. Apparently the enzymatic ability for beta oxidation can reside in the plant as well as in microorganisms.
10.2307/4040620|Black henbane (Hyoscyamus niger L.) has invaded cultivated land, pastures, and disturbed areas in east central Saskatchewan. This species flourishes during cycles of abundant moisture and disappears during dry cycles, surviving in Saskatchewan only in moist depressions or disturbed areas. Summerfallow, fall tillage, and competition from vigorous perennial grasses provide effective control of the weed. Black henbane is not likely to become a serious deterrent to crop production in Saskatchewan.
10.2307/4040615| This investigation studied simazine (2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine), atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine), propazine (2-chloro-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine), and prometone (2-methoxy-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine). Preemergence applications of granular formulations of simazine on attaclay or calcium sulfate of simazine at 1 to 2 ppmw controlled Potamogeton, Najas, Ceratophyllum, Heteranthera and Zannichellia. Higher rates were required to control filamentous algae (Cladophora and Pithophora) and chara (Chara vulgaris). Early postemergence applications of wettable powder to submersed aquatics and filamentous algae were often effective. Atrazine gave similar results. Concentrations of 0.5 to 1.0 were effective in controlling Cladophora and Pithophora and three species of Potamogeton in pond applications. Spray applications, generally, were more effective than broadcasting granular atrazine. Propazine and prometone did not control submersed species in concentrations up to 3 ppmw. Simazine had a relatively high margin of safety with respect to acute toxicity to fish. It was less toxic than propazine, prometone or atrazine. Granular forms were less toxic than wettable powder or emulsifiable concentrates. Laboratory tests on bottom organisms gave an acute LD toxic dosage of 28 ppmw. Field observations did not demonstrate a serious reduction in the production of bottom organisms. However, the control of aquatic vegetation brought about ecological changes affecting bottom dwelling and weed clinging organisms. These changes would affect certain fishes with special food habits. 
10.2307/4040609|The postemergence herbicidal activity and specificity of 16 s-triazines on 8 test species were determined at 3 application rates and the influence of various substitutions discussed.
10.2307/4040607|Ford soybean yields and weed yields were studied under combinations of tillage treatments, 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben) applications, hand weedings, and row spacings on irrigated and non-irrigated locations in Nebraska during 1961 and 1962. Soybean yields increased and weed yields decreased with tillage, amiben applications, hand weedings, and narrow-row spacing of soybeans. Combinations of these weed control treatments gave more dependable results than any one alone. Each 86 lb/A of weeds present produced an average soybean yield reduction of 1 bu/A. Advantages of growing soybeans with amiben applications in 10-inch rows as compared to 40-inch rows are: (a) an average soybean yield increase of 39%, (b) elimination or reduction of tillage (c) a 50 to 75% reduction in amiben application rate, and (d) little or no soybean injury from the lower rates of amiben required in the 10-inch rows.
10.2307/4040617|Absorption and translocation in both leaves and roots is less under low temperatures. Seasonal response of wheat to 2,4-D is conditioned by the stage of growth as well as environment. The response of wheat and downy bromegrass to triazine herbicides is seasonal, whereas the response to carbamate herbicides appears to be influenced by local environmental conditions at time of spraying. Physiological condition of fiddleneck is more important than age, i.e., plants in the rosette stage were always far more sensitive than bolting plants of the same age. Sensitivity to 2,4-D was greater at 26 C than at 10 C or 5 C at all stages of growth. Applications of certain metabolites, especially thiamin, increased the sensitivity of fiddleneck to 2,4-D at low temperatures.
10.2307/4040616|Alligator juniper (Juniperus deppeana Steud.) is a weed tree of Arizona and New Mexico. It sprouts from stems, roots, or especially from buds on the crown, whenever the top is destroyed. Adequate mechanical control requires that the root crown be removed from the soil. Treatment of stumps with pelleted 3-phenyl-1,1-dimethylurea (fenuron) on the soil or polychlorobenzoic acid (PBA) sprayed on the stumps are promising means of preventing sprouting.
10.2307/4040599| An effective technique was developed for partitioning the environment of intact submersed aquatic plants. The technique facilitates absorption and translocation studies by permitting application of radioactive herbicides to selected portions of the plants. Root and shoot treatments of Potamogeton pectinatus L. for 24 to 96 hours with C-labeled 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid (fenac) showed no leakage across the partitioned system. Little or no basipetal translocation of the herbicide was observed. Limited acropetal translocation occurred and this was reduced by removal of tubers prior to herbicide application. Accumulation of activity in nodal regions of the stem was noted. 
10.2307/4040618|B. verticillata Meyer was killed by selective rates of 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid (fenac), but not by selective rates of nine of the most common phenoxy herbicides. It was also killed by soil-sterilant rates of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron) and 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA) but not by soil-sterilant rates of three s-triazine compounds. With all herbicides, treatments made in the wet season gave better results than those made in the dry season.
10.2307/4040601|Experiments were conducted in 200-gal concrete tanks to evaluate a large fresh-water snail, Marisa cornuarietis, as a biological aquatic weed control agent. Adult Marisa snails were collected from a canal near Miami, Florida, where a colony had recently become established. These snails are of South American origin and appear identical to those being used in Puerto Rico for biological control of schistosomiasis. The snails controlled Ceratophyllum demersum, Najas guadalupensis, and Potamogeton illinoensis completely and Pistia stratiotes and Alternanthera philoxeroides partially. Eichhornia crassipes was not completely eaten, but its growth and flowering were greatly retarded by the root-pruning action of the snails. Marisa preferred submersed weeds to floating or emersed weeds, but the floating weed Salvinia rotundifolia was eaten nearly as readily as submersed weeds. Little damage was done by Marisa to 4- and 5-week-old rice plants, but younger rice was killed when the snails had no other source of food. A common snail-eating bird, Cassidix mexicanus, was found to be a predator of Marisa in Florida. Except for its possible deletarious effects in rice-growing areas, Marisa was regarded as very promising for control of aquatic weeds at least in confined bodies of water.
10.2307/4040735|When crop plants were competing with well-established quackgrass (Agropyron repens) for the same nutrient supply, chlorosis and stunting of crop plants occurred. Apparently this was due to the greater ability of quackgrass to withdraw available nutrients, especially nitrogen, and to a lesser extent phosphorus and potassium, from the nutrient solution. No evidence was obtained for a phytotoxic substance from living quackgrass roots or rhizomes that could inhibit germination or growth of alfalfa and oats. Quackgrass residues in large amounts caused chlorosis and stunting in alfalfa and oats when added to soil. The evidence obtained linked this behavior to the high C:N ratio with consequent temporary deficiency of available nitrogen. Water extracts of quackgrass leaves or rhizomes were not phytotoxic unless subjected to high temperatures during or subsequent to extraction. If soils contained decomposing quackgrass or crop plant residues, extremely phytotoxic extracts of such soils were obtained, but only when soils were saturated and decomposition was anaerobic.
10.2307/4040740|In a closed system the vapors from the potassium salt of 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid caused severe damage and death of Pinto beans. Vapors from the potassium salt of 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid caused more injury to Pinto beans than vapors from the same application rates of the propylene glycol butyl ether esters of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid or the dimethylamine salt of 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid.
10.2307/4040738|Soil-surface applications of isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamate (CIPC), 2-chloroallyl diethyldithiocarbamate (CDEC), ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (EPTC), sodium 2,4-dichlorophenoxyethyl sulfate (sesone), and N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) were made on a Willacy fine sandy loam just before and after a 24-to-32 mph windstorm, which moved significant amounts of treated soil. All treatments were overhead-irrigated after the storm. All herbicides performed less efficiently after the wind. CIPC was found below the surface of soil only when applications were undisturbed by the wind.
10.2307/4040722|As the seeds of leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.) increase in age after fertilization, their color changes from yellow to yellow with brown tips, to brown ends with a narrow yellow band, to brown with an orange band, and to a reddish-brown seed, followed in order by brown, gray-brown, gray, and finally, mottled. The last four are viable; the others are not. Mowing of leafy spurge to prevent viable seed production must be done before seeds have turned brown. Brown seeds appeared 10 to 13 days after fertilization depending upon seasonal conditions.
10.2307/4040732|Experiments were conducted at Lincoln, North Platte, and Alliance, Nebraska, during 1961 and 1962 to determine the effect of tillage, atrazine, hand-weeding, and row spacings on RS 501 sorghum and weed yields. Combinations of tillage, narrow row spacings, and preemergence 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isoproplyamino-s-triazine (atrazine) treatments gave more dependable weed control than any one alone. Sorghum yields increased and weed yields decreased with tillage and atrazine treatments. Preemergence atrazine applications as low as 1 lb/A gave higher sorghum yields and lower weed yields than postemergence atrazine applications of 2 to 4 lb/A. Preemergence atrazine applications should be reduced on lighter soils because atrazine gives more effective weed control and increased sorghum injury on such soils. There was a 1 bu/A decrease in sorghum yield for each 50 lb/A of weeds present.
10.2307/4040724| Jimsonweed (Datura stromonium) was treated with carboxyl-labeled C 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D*); autoradiographs and extraction of radioactive materials were used to determine the movement and form of the herbicide. Activity rapidly decreased in the leafy tissue. There was an accumulation of activity in the stem, but very little accumulation in the roots. With the exception of the stem tissue where minor alteration of the herbicide occurred, 2,4-D* was the only radioactive material recovered from jimsonweed. A loss of radioactivity from the root systems indicated a possible detoxification mechanism for jimsonweed. Up to 25% of the 2,4-D* applied to jimsonweed was expelled from the roots in six weeks. 
10.2307/4040739|Internal dormancy was shown to occur in western ironweed (Vernonia baldwinni Torr.) and leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.) in late summer and fall. Time required for emergence and extent of growth were important indicators of dormancy. Dormancy is apparently broken naturally in the field by low soil temperatures.
10.2307/4040727| Paraquat (1,1-dimethyl-4,4-dipyridylium cation) removed weedy annual grasses from seedings of rose clover (Trifolium hirtum All.) and subclover (T. subterraneum L.) with only temporary damage to the clovers when applied at early growth stages. Paraquat applied under weed-free conditions reduced herbage yields of Lana woollypod vetch (Vicia dasycarpa Ten.) and Wimmera ryegrass (Lolium rigidum Gaud.) at three dates of application; neither herbage nor seed yield of rose or subclover was reduced. 
10.2307/4040718|Weed Science-a new scientific discipline, has evolved and caused a revolution in agricultural technology. Weeds and their control are basically ecological and economic problems. The losses caused by weeds and the cost of their control, now estimated to exceed $4 1/2 billion annually, are motivating forces in the revolution. The technological revolution in Weed Science is characterized by the rapid and extensive acceptance and use of chemical weed control methods, expanded scope and diversity of weed research, advances in Weed Science technology, needs and challenges for advances in future technology, impact of chemical weed control on farm management practices, and its effect on the objectives and direction of agricultural research and educational programs. Chemical methods of weed control greatly reduce energy requirements on farms. Herbicides reduce the manpower, machine hours, and machine horsepower requirements in crop production. Thus, herbicides provide a new dimension for improving farming efficiency and lowering production costs. In 1962, chemical methods of weed control were used on more than 70 million acres of agricultural land at a cost of more than $272 million, as compared to approximately 53 million acres treated in 1959 at a cost of $128 million, a 33 percent increase in the acreage treated in 1962. The acreage treated in 1962 was equivalent to about 25 percent of the national crop acreage. These use data do not include chemical weed control on industrial sites and other non-agricultural lands. Chemical weed control is having a far-reaching impact on all phases of crop production. New chemical methods of weed control will affect choice of crop and variety; seedbed preparation; method of seeding; seeding rates; row spacing; plant spacing in the row; plant populations; fertilizer practices including type, time of application, and placement; cultivation; irrigation practices; harvesting; seed-cleaning operations; erosion control; fallow practices for weed control; disease and insect control practices; pasture renovation; pasture and range management; clearing new lands for crops or pasture; forest management; utilization of farm water resources for irrigation and recreation; and maintenance of drainage ditches, ditchbanks, irrigation canals, and farm roadsides. Agriculture is on the horizon of a second-generation breakthrough in production efficiency because of the revolution in Weed Science. Already the accomplishments made possible by this revolution have established the necessity for a new research cycle in crop production that can result in new plateaus of crop yields, crop quality, and production and harvesting efficiency.
10.2307/4040733|In one study, twelve treatments consisting of 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine), 2-chloro-4,6-bis-(ethylamino)-6-isoproplyamino-s-triazine (simazine), 3-(p-chloro-phenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron) and 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron) applied alternately in a program pre- and postemergence to the weeds were evaluated on ten sugar cane plantations. Averaged data indicated that combinations including atrazine outperformed simazine in every instance and diuron was better than monuron on all plantations but one. Diuron was most effective on grasses, e.g., Digitaria spp. whereas atrazine was outstanding against Commelina diffusa Burm. In a second study on the same plantations, the initial treatment of 5 lb/A of atrazine followed by 3 lb/A of diuron gave outstanding weed control on five plantations. Using 3 lb/A of each material applied simultaneously had merit at times but some plantations required only a single application of either material. Net days of weed control obtained by diuron were inversely dependent on the amount of chemical adsorbed by the soil in both studies and total days control appeared to be dependent on ample rainfall in the second.
10.2307/4040723|Livestock losses, mainly to cattle, from Astragalus miser Dougl. ex Hook. (timber milkvetch) have been reported since 1927. The species is found in the northwestern United States and also in Alberta and British Columbia. Recent taxonomic treatment distinguishes eight varieties. The most northern variety (A. miser var. serotinus (Gray) Barneby) and the most southern variety (A. miser var. oblongifolius (Rydb.) Cronq.) are the only two varieties known to cause livestock losses, but all varieties should be regarded as poisonous until it is known they are not. A. miser var. oblongifolius was controlled with 2 lb/A of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) or 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxypropionic acid (silvex). Removal of A. miser increased both cover and frequency of grass species.
10.2307/4040730|In two experiments beans were kept weed-free for various periods early in the season, and in a third, weeds were allowed to grow with beans for various periods before being removed. Weeds which emerged soon after planting caused extensive reductions in bean yields, but the actual yield-reducing competition occurred considerably later in the season. For 5 to 7 weeks after planting, the grower must control weeds by chemical or other means; for the remainder of the season, bean competition provides weed control.
10.2307/4040737|A system involving resting cells of Euglena gracilis provides a rapid and convenient test system for screening potential herbicides which act as inhibitors of chlorophyll synthesis. The system appears to distinguish between inhibitors of chloroplast formation, such as 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, and inhibitors of chlorophyll formation per se, such as ethionine.
10.2307/4040728|Direction and rate of translocation of sucrose* from urea* 2,4-D* (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) and amitrole* (3-amino-1,2,4-triazole) were toward regions of active growth. In oak seedlings translocation was slower than in cotton seedlings. In oak seedlings growing leaves and shoots constitute active sinks toward which tracers move. Sucrose* from urea* translocates freely; 2,4-D* moves less freely because of accumulation enroute; amitrole* is intermediate between these. High humidity induces rapid and extensive uptake of tracers by oak seedlings; the increase over normal transport is mainly in the xylem.
10.2307/4040726|Swainsona salsula is an unpalatable legume of Asiatic origin which spreads by seed and lateral roots and has become a problem in some poorly drained, marshy, or saline areas of several western states. Its growth characteristics indicate a high potential for establishment along stream banks, irrigation canals, wasteways, pastures, and meadows with high water tables and other poorly drained areas. Its aggressiveness results in its dominance on such areas. 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid (silvex), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, (2,4-D), or 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) applied at 2 lb/A for 2 or more years in succession controlled swainsonpea satisfactorily on cropped land. 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA) was also effective.
10.2307/4040734|Five strains of Johnsongrass [Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers.] in selected and random plantings received repeated foliar applications of 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon). For three characters studied, the residual variance was less with selected plantings than with random plantings. Johnsongrass strains differed in their response to dalapon.
10.2307/4040729|A metabolite of swep [methyl N-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-carbamate] was detected in the straw, hulls and bran layer of rice but not in the polished rice grain (endosperm) or bran oil, using microcoulometric gas chromatography (MCGC). This metabolite was identified as a swep-lignin complex which is quite stable and not extractable from plant tissues by common organic solvents. Upon extraction with HCl-dioxane, a portion of this complex is hydrolyzed to swep and soluble products of lignin. The swep was purified by adsorption chromatography and identified by infrared spectroscopy and microcoulometric gas chromatography retention times. The mechanism of swep-lignin complex formation is considered to be an example of a common detoxification mechanism by plants through immobilization.
10.2307/4040720|Root sections of Canada thistles (Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.) from 10 locations in Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Wyoming were planted at Bozeman, Montana. Leaf margins varied from deeply ruffled and lobed with numerous spines, to entire margins essentially without spines. Flowers varied in color from shades of purple to pale blue and white. Seed size ranged from 300,000 to 673,000 seeds per pound. The earliest ecotype emerged about 2 weeks before the latest and shoot and flower development and height of plants were varied.
10.2307/4040725|Naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino s-triazine (atrazine) were applied to Chlorella pyrenoidosa in an attempt to characterize mathematically the growth inhibition responses obtained. (Chlorella was found to serve well as a test organism.) Inhibition results induced by NAA and 2,4-D satisfactorily supported the hypothesis inherent in the kinetic interpretation. Results with atrazine were most satisfactorily interpreted by a probit analysis which showed large differences in rate of toxicity between high and low concentrations. This difference is thought to be responsible for the poor fit to a straight line in the reciprocal plots of the kinetic analysis. It is assumed that growth inhibition by atrazine resulted from a blocking of the photosynthetic process.
10.2307/4040736|Bioassay methods are described for determining the concentration of 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid in solutions and in soil. These methods are suitable for determining the concentration of the herbicide in the presence of other herbicides. These test methods can detect considerably less than one microgram of herbicide.
10.2307/4040721|Seed dormancy in velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medic.) was due primarily to an impermeable seed coat. Embryo dormancy was not a factor in the occurrence or maintenance of seed dormancy. The presence of germination inhibitors was indicated, but their role in seed dormancy appeared limited. The termination of dormancy under field conditions was considered to result from naturally occurring fractures in the seed coat. The point of fracture was always in the region of the chalazal slit and was considered to follow intense drying under natural conditions. Drying seed in laboratory experiments produced the same fractures in seed coats.
10.2307/4040731|Sorghum grain yield losses in Northwest and Central Texas caused by uncontrolled weed growth varied from 8 to 41%. Under high moisture conditions, sorghum competed best with weeds when planted thickly in narrow rows. With less moisture, seeding in wide rows resulted in more effective competition. If rains produced weed germination immediately after planting, competition with the sorghum was more severe than when weeds germinated 1 or 2 months after sorghum planting. Several mechanical weed control methods were very successful.
10.2307/4041096|Recrystallized 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron), 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron), 3-phenyl-1,1-dimethyl-urea (fenuron), 1-n-butyl-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methylurea (neburon), 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine), 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine), 5-bromo-3-isopropyl-6-methyluracil (isocil), and 5-bromo-3-sec-butyl-6-methyluracil (bromacil) were deposited in thin layers on aluminum planchets, irradiated with far, middle, and near ultraviolet light and collected in ethanol. Spectral changes in the ultraviolet region and losses were determined spectrophotometrically. The greatest changes and losses occurred with far ultraviolet and the least with near ultraviolet irradiation. Little or no spectral changes occurred in the dark, but there was some loss of each herbicide.
10.2307/4041090| It was shown that less sprouting of blue oak (Quercus douglasii) and California black oak (Q. kelloggii) occurred when treated stumps were (a) cut 30 cm rather than 90 cm high, (b) treated at once after cutting rather than after 7 days, (c) treated with 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) amine rather than with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) amine, and (d) left uncovered rather than covered. The differences between treatments eventually disappeared because of the death of the sprouts, possibly due to the levels of herbicide used in making the treatments. The downward movement of carboxyl C-labeled 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole-5-C, and C-labeled urea in interior live oak (Q. wislizenii) stumps was studied. Rainfall, level of 2,4-D applied, and time interval all appeared to influence downward movement. 
10.2307/4041091|Dicamba (dimethylamine salt of 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid) followed slightly behind the forward penetration of added water in both loam and sandy loam soils. Dicamba persisted longer than 2,4-D butyl ester in autoclaved and not-autoclaved loam and sandy loam soils. Tartary buckwheat, Fagopyrum tataricum (L.) Gaertn. planted at intervals in the autoclaved soils showed no injury from the 2,4-D at 16 oz/A after 4 weeks but was completely killed by dicamba at 8 oz/A after 12 weeks of incubation. In the not-autoclaved soils there was no visible effect on the buck-wheat plants from 2,4-D after 2 weeks but nearly all of the plants were killed by dicamba after 12 weeks of incubation. Oxygen consumption in the loam soil was greatly reduced by dicamba at concentrations of 10,000 ppm or higher. Similar concentrations of 2,4-D butyl ester had only a slight and sometimes no effect on oxygen uptake. These concentrations are well in excess of those suggested for selective weed control in grain crops.
10.2307/4041087|The following surfactants were prepared at various concentrations in distilled water, with and without 3% W/V technical or formulated 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon): anionic-Vatsol OT (sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate), sodium lauryl sulfate; nonionic-Dynawet (chemistry undisclosed), X-77 (alkylarylpolyoxyethylene glycols, free fatty acids and isopropanol), Tween 20 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate), Tween 80 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate), T-1947 (polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene polyols). Contact angles on paraffin coated plexiglas and corn leaf surfaces correlated well with surface tension measurements. With solutions having surface tensions of 31 dynes/cm or less, leaf wetting was complete. Although surfactants differed considerably in their influence on surface tension and wetting, all markedly enhanced herbicidal activity, increasingly with rate. The superiority of Vatsol OT as a surface tension reducer and wetting agent was confirmed. Vatsol OT alone was toxic to corn at 0.5% concentration and higher; T-1947 and sodium lauryl sulfate produced early injury symptoms at 5.0% but caused no lasting effect; all other surfactants were nontoxic at all concentrations used. Minimum surface tensions and contact angles occurred at 0.1-0.5% concentration for all surfactants. However, maximum herbicidal activity was observed at ten times these levels or greater. Thus above 0.1-0.5% surfactant concentration herbicidal enhancement was not correlated with surface tension lowering, contact angle, observed wettability or initial toxicity of the surfactants. This confirms the view that herbicide-surfactant-plant surface interactions, more specific than mere increased wetting, are a part of total surfactant action.
10.2307/4041093|Nemaha oats and 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben) were effective in reducing weed growth during sweetclover establishment. Hubam and Madrid sweetclover, as well as Nemaha oats, were tolerant of amiben rates necessary for annual weed control. Second-year Madrid sweetclover hay yields were increased from amiben applications the previous year.
10.2307/4041095|Giant foxtail (Setaria faberii Herrm.) was grown from seed in controlled climate rooms at temperatures of 50, 60, 70, and 80 F and photoperiods of 8, 12, 16, and 20 hours. An inherently poor primary root system resulted in slow and uniform growth during the first few weeks under all environmental conditions. Giant foxtail produced the most dry matter at the highest temperatures and longest photoperiods. No photoperiod inhibited flowering but photoperiod produced differences in development of inflorescences. Within any temperature, the longer the photoperiod the greater the size of panicle and number of seeds produced. Seed viability was high at 80 and 70 F, low at 60 F and zero at 50 F within all photoperiods.
10.2307/4041100|Giant foxtail (Setaria faberii Herrm.) germinated, emerged, and produced panicles containing viable seeds when sown during the greater part of the growing season. The height of the plant, size of panicle, and number of seeds produced depended on date of planting. Cutting to 2 inches at various stages of growth did not prevent further growth and reflowering but reduced the size of the panicle and the number of seeds. Mowing in May and June allowed giant foxtail to produce two crops of viable seeds.
10.2307/4041097| The extent of adsorption of five C-labeled s-triazines, 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine), 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine), 2-chloro-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (propazine), 2-methoxy-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (prometone), and 2,4-bis(isopropylamino)-6-methylmercapto-s-triazine (prometryne) from aqueous solutions by soil constituents was expressed as a distribution coefficient (Kd), which is the ratio of the amount of herbicide adsorbed to the amount in the equilibrium solution. The Kd value for a given s-triazine and exchanger remained relatively constant over a range of concentrations. The adsorption reaction was essentially at equilibrium within 1 hour. Increasing the temperature and pH resulted in decreased adsorption of simazine and atrazine. The order of increasing adsorption of these compounds by soils was propazine, atrazine, simazine, prometone and prometryne. Increased amounts of organic matter and/or clay in a soil generally were associated with increased adsorption of these s-triazines. No adsorption of simazine or atrazine was detected with kaolinite. Putnam clay, illite, and montmorillonite were increasingly adsorptive in that order. The organic materials were generally much more adsorptive than the clays. The adsorption reaction was reversible by increasing temperatures, water elution, and elution with various organic solvents. Fifty percent ethanol plus heat was very effective in eluting the chloro-s-triazines from soil. 
10.2307/4041094|Some seeds of Cicuta douglasii (DC.) Coult. & Rose (western waterhemlock), Cuscuta planiflora Tenore (smallseed dodder), Cuscuta indecora Choisy (largeseed dodder), Linaria dalmatica Mill. (Dalmatian toadflax), Asclepias speciosa Torr. (showy milkweed), and Halogeton glomeratus (M. Bieb.) C. A. Mey (halogeton) (brown seeds) still germinated after 12 months of submergence at 12- and 48-inch depths in canal water. Black seeds of halogeton were not viable after 6 months. In another test, 35 percent of the seeds of Polygonum persicaria L. (ladysthumb) remained firm and 24 percent germinated after 5 years. Seeds of Cichorium intybus L. (chicory) and Swainsona salsula (Pall.) Taub. (swainsonpea) were not decomposed and devitalized in toto until after 5 years. No seeds of Avena fatua L. (wild oat), Bassia hyssopifolia (Pall.) Kuntze (fivehook bassia), and Rumex crispus L. (curly dock) sprouted after 6, 18, and 42 months, respectively. No seeds of Salsola kali L. var. tenuifolia Tausch (Russian thistle) and few seeds of Sonchus arvensis L. (perennial sowthistle) germinated after 3 months.
10.2307/4041102|Silvex, [2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid], impregnated (20% ae) on clay granules, applied at a rate as low as 20 lb/A ae gave excellent control of well-rooted alligatorweed [Alternanthera philoxeroides (Mart.) Grieb] growing in less than 18 inches of water. The 2-ethylhexyl ester of silvex was more effective than the potassium salt. Silvex was not effective on floating-mat alligatorweed or in water over 18 inches deep.
10.2307/4041088|Herbicidal rates (5 to 9 lb/A) of 2-chloroallyl diethyldithiocarbamate (CDEC) retarded emergence of head lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) reduced both pre- and postthinning plant populations, caused injury symptoms in young plants, affected the subsequent rate of growth, date of maturity, weight of marketable heads, and yield. Decreased yields were attributed to a reduction in plant population, poor head solidity, and small head development. Reductions in yield were in proportion to dosage and of economic importance.
10.2307/4041104| Diquat (6,7-dihydropyrido[1,2-a:2,1-c] pyrazidiinium salt) was applied to several emergent, submersed, floating-leaved, and free-floating aquatic plants common in Central Illinois ponds. At relatively low rates, it was effective in controlling several submersed aquatic plants but not American pondweed, Potamogeton nodosus, and cabomba, Cabomba caroliniana. This herbicide also was effective on several common emergent species. 
10.2307/4041098|During a 2-year study corn exhibited relatively good tolerance to flaming at a speed of 4 mph. Soybeans were more susceptible to injury by flaming at early growth stages than was corn. For weed control conventional cultivation and preemergence herbicides were superior to flaming. Damage to crop or weeds was influenced by morphology of the plant, size of plant, adjustment of equipment, number of flamings, and speed or length of exposure. This study suggests that flame cultivation would not be very competitive in areas where preemergence herbicides and conventional cultivation give satisfactory control of weeds. Although cost of gas would be about equal to cost of herbicide, cost of flame cultivation equipment is about five times greater, and flame cultivation would require 2 to 4 more trips over the field. Flame cultivation may have more potential in the drier areas where preemergence herbicides have been less effective.
10.2307/4041084|The effects of various rates of 7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (endothall), isopropyl N-phenylcarbamate (IPC), and 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (dicamba) on Bromus tectorum L. (downy brome) on four soils with surface litter and incorporated organic matter treatments were studied. Significant differences were found in reaction of downy brome seedlings to the herbicides in the four soils. The soil with the highest organic matter content generally inhibited herbicide action to the greatest extent. Straw mulch alone caused a significant decrease in growth of downy brome seedlings. Action of IPC was most inhibited by straw, and endothall the least.
10.2307/4041082|A 7-year ecological study of natural infestations of globe-podded (Cardaria pubescens) and lens-podded (C. chalapensis) hoary cresses was conducted under conditions of irrigation and dry land farming in southern Saskatchewan. Density and area measurements were compared annually in competition with grasses, forbs and shrubs in several environments. The hoary cresses are well adapted to moist situations but are not particularly vigorous in dry, semi-arid environments. Globe-podded hoary cress was better able to survive a period of drought than the lens-podded species. Native roses (Rosa spp.), western snowberry (Symphoricarpos occidentalis) and Russian knapweed (Centaurea repens) were the most effective competitors of the hoary cresses. Alfalfa and to a lesser degree, bromegrass were also effective. As these infestations of hoary cress are situated upstream from the Saskatchewan River Irrigation Project, they constitute a serious threat to many acres of irrigable farmland. Control by cultural means is shown to be feasible.
10.2307/4041086|Germination of dormant crabgrass seed, Digitaria ischaemum (Schreb.) Muhl. and D. sanguinalis L., was increased by treatment with the nematocides 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane and ethylene dibromide.
10.2307/4041106| A chromatographic method with silver nitrate reagent detected dalapon extracted from quackgrass (Agropyron repens (L.) Beauv.) rhizomes. Minimum detectable quantity was 210 grams. Following field applications of dalapon, the amounts recovered 1 hour after spraying were low for plots receiving 4 lb/A while relatively high amounts were found initially from 8 lb and 12 lb/A treatments, but several days later, these relations were reversed. 
10.2307/4041083|Early spring or late fall treatments of 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile (dichlobenil) were effective for the control of several annual and perennial sedges, grasses, and broadleaf weeds in cranberry bogs. Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate (CIPC) 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2,4-D and 2-chloro-4,6-bis (ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) as spring applications were less effective than dichlobenil for the wide spectrum of weeds encountered. Single spring applications of as much as 4 lb/A of dichlobenil, 6 lb/A of 2,4-D, 24 lb/A of CIPC, and 2 lb/A of simazine were tolerated by the cranberry vines. Dichlobenil at 4 and 6 lb/A caused reductions in upright growth and fruit size. Keeping quality of mature fruit was not adversely affected by herbicidal rates of any of the materials.
10.2307/4041092|A study was conducted to determine the effects of five densities each of rough pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), green foxtail (Setaria viridis (L.) Beauv.), and combinations of the two upon sugar beet yields, top weights, percent sucrose, and total vegetation weights. Green foxtail was less competitive per plant than rough pigweed. Foxtail densities of less than one plant per beet did not reduce beet yields significantly. Rough pigweed alone or combined with green foxtail reduced the beet root yields significantly at all densities in this study. Root yields were reduced 80 percent by two pigweeds and two foxtails per sugar beet. Beet top weights were consistently higher than those of the roots and were reduced approximately in proportion to those of the roots by the various weed densities. The diameter and length of the sugar beets were significantly reduced by competition, the diameter being more affected than the length. The percent sucrose of sugar beets was not affected by weed competition.
10.2307/4041099|The phytotoxicities of three phenylurea herbicides applied annually to cotton at rates used for selective weed control were studied in irrigated soils of the southwestern United States. Yields of seed cotton were generally not affected by annual applications of 3-(p-chlorophenyl-1)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron) and 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron). Annual applications of 3-phenyl-1,1-dimethylurea (fenuron) often reduced seed cotton yields. Mild chlorosis of foliage of cotton seedlings was occasionally observed when monuron was used annually. Although diuron affected the growth of oats and barley 6 to 12 months after application, it caused no adverse effect on cotton seedlings. Monuron residues affected barley and oats more severely than did diuron residues. Accumulation of diuron and monuron from annual applications at rates used for selective weed control in cotton appears unlikely.
10.2307/4041107|The acid and amine formulations of 2,4-dichorophenoxy-acetic acid (2,4-D) can be extracted from soybean seed simultaneously or separately. The method consists of partitioning first between ethyl ether and citrate-phosphate buffer and then between carbon tetrachloride and citrate-phosphate buffer. Quantitative determination of the 2,4-D can be made by means of chromatography.
10.2307/4041089| Metabolic incorporation of adenine-2- by Saccharomyces cerevisiae was examined for alterations produced by 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole) and histidine. The radioactivity recovered from cells after a 4-hour incubation was found predominantly in ethanol-insoluble components (nucleic acids and proteins) of untreated cultures. Amitrole inhibited incorporation of C into insoluble components. Carbon-labeled imidazoleglycerol phosphate, a precursor of histidine, and labeled imidazoleglycerol accumulated in the ethanol-soluble fraction of amitrole treated cells. Imidazoleglycerol accumulated in the external medium. Histidine prevented C incorporation into the hot trichloroacetic acid-insoluble residue (protein), prevented amitrole-induced imidazoleglycerol and imidazoleglycerol phosphate accumulation, and circumvented amitrole inhibition of C incorporation into the hot trichloroacetic acid-soluble (nucleic acids) fraction. 
10.2307/4041105|3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben) and N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) were applied to soybeans and 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) and 2-chloro-N, N-diallylacetamide (CDAA) to corn as sprays and as granules. Except where excellent weed control was established by the herbicides, rotary hoeing 2 weeks after application of the herbicides usually improved the degree of weed control without any detrimental effect on performance of the herbicides.
10.2307/4041101| Methionine-methyl-C administered to seedling tissue produces radioactive polymers consisting primarily of protein. Formation of polymer was inhibited within half an hour in susceptible species by 1, 10, and 50 ppm concentrations of isopropyl N-phenylcarbamate (IPC), isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamate (CIPC), methyl N-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)carbamate (swep), and 4-chloro-2-butynyl N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamate (barban). Resistance to inhibition varied with plant species, and was in accord with previously observed responses in field work. Inhibition of amino acid utilization may be a fundamental cause of carbamate phytotoxicity. Formation of material tentatively described as lignin is also inhibited. 
10.2307/4041103| Cotton plants were treated with C-ring-labeled 2-methylmercapto-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (prometryne) which was soil-incorporated or placed in solution cultures. C-labeled material accumulated in the lysigenous glands of roots, stems and leaves. No evolution of C-carbon dioxide could be detected. Unaltered C-prometryne was present in stems and leaves 23 weeks after treatment, but no radioactive materials could be detected in the seed. Small amounts of hydroxypropazine were isolated from the stems and leaves of plants grown in soil, but none was detected in plants grown in solution culture. Both water-soluble and acetone-insoluble radioactive materials accumulated in the leaves, stems and roots of all treated plants. 
10.2307/4041085|The growth and development of newly-planted red tart cherry trees on a silt loam soil were satisfactory following six annual treatments of 2.5, 5, and 10 lb/A of 2-chloro-4,6-bis (ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) or 2.5 lb/A of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1, 1-dimethylurea (diuron). Measurements of tree diameter and leaf area gave no evidence of injury. The control of annual and perennial weeds was excellent. In survey experiments, trees which received 80 lb/A of simazine in 4 years were not injured, but 160 lb/A in 4 years produced leaf injury in the fourth and fifth years.
10.2307/4040898|Greenhouse evaluation of 13 herbicides indicated that several were suitable for preemergence weed control in sesame. CIPC appeared best and was field evaluated for 2 years. This herbicide provided adequate to excellent annual weed control without plant injury or reductions in yield.
10.2307/4040882|Watering with 1 surface cm or more following spray treatment with dicamba (2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid) and picloram (4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid) markedly increased inhibition of shoot growth from rhizome sections of quackgrass (Agropyron repens (L.) Beauv.) and bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss). Shoots were most sensitive to the herbicides at early stages of development. Bromegrass and quackgrass were about equally susceptible to the two herbicides. Uptake through roots or rhizomes was more effective than foliar uptake. Kentucky bluegrass in established sod was not injured by dosages of the two herbicides that killed or controlled quackgrass. Young stands of Kentucky bluegrass were more sensitive.
10.2307/4040879|The substituted urea herbicides were rated according to their effectiveness as aquatic herbicides in this order: diuron [3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea], monuron [3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea], neburon [1-butyl-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methlyurea] and TCA (trichloroacetic acid) mixtures with them. They showed greatest potential in controlling certain aquatic plants in preemergence and early postemergence applications. However, relatively high concentrations were required to control filamentous algae (Cladophora, Pithophora and Spirogyra), chara (Chara), coontail (Ceratophyllum), naiad (Najas), and pondweeds (Potamogeton) for periods of time exceeding three months and up to three years. Granular formulations achieved better distribution of herbicides for control of rooted aquatic plants along the margins of lakes and ponds. Wettable powder and liquid emulsifiable concentrates were superior to granular formulations for the control of algae and emergent or floating aquatic plants. Monuron and fenuron were less toxic to fish than were diuron and neburon. The TCA mixtures were somewhat more toxic than the simple ureas. Some species of fish were more sensitive than others and fingerlings more sensitive than adults of the same species. Fish-food organisms were reduced appreciably in plastic enclosures at herbicidal concentrations.
10.2307/4040893| (Arbutus menziesii Pursh.) trees in the field (15-20 cm diameter) xyacetic acid (2,4-D*) and 2,4-5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T*) in blue oak (Quercus douglasii H. & A.) seedlings occurred following application of these herbicides to cuts made through the bark into the wood of stems. Downward transport was limited. C-labeled 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole*), maleic hydrazide (MH*), urea*, and P-labeled phosphate translocated extensively into the roots as well as upward into the shoots. High humidity had little effect on translocation of 2,4-D* and 2,4,5-T* into the roots, but had marked effect on translocation of amitrole*, MH*, and urea*. The addition of herbicidal amounts of unlabeled 2,4-D or 2,4,5-T reduced translocation of labeled compounds into the roots. Unlabeled 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram) or 2,4-D applied to cuts prevented translocation into the roots of all but traces of MH* applied to the same cuts. Treatment of blue oak or madrone (Arbutus menziesii Pursh.) trees in the field (15-20 cm diameter) with herbicidal doses of 2,4-D or picloram largely inhibited the downward movement of PO applied to the same cuts at all stages of growth; such interference was less pronounced in madrone than in blue oak. 
10.2307/4040880|In greenhouse studies, Johnsongrass [Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers.] seedlings were killed when the first internode passed through treated soil. Shoots from rhizomes were not killed, but lateral root development was inhibited on that stem portion in contact with treated soil. Trifluralin may control Johnsongrass seedlings, but it is not likely that it will be useful in the control of established stands.
10.2307/4040878| Seedbed preparation was completed about October 15, just before the fall rains. Four herbicide treatments, 1,1-dimethyl-4,4-bipyridinium salt (paraquat), 6,7-dihydrodipyrido(1,2-a:2,1-c)pyrazidiinium salt (diquat), isopropyl N-phenylcarbamate (IPC) + butoxyethanol ester of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole + ammonium thiocyanate (amitrole-T) were successfully applied before Janaury 15 for control of weeds and volunteer crop plants. Grasses for seed production were sown in March without disturbing the soil. An application of paraquat at seeding greatly increased subsequent seed yields. Little additional germination of contaminating weed grasses occurred after the grasses were planted and they became established rapidly. By the following October most species could be treated with 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron) to control winter annual weeds. Where weeds were thus effectively controlled during the establishment period, excellent stands resulted which produced high yields of weed-free seed in the first year of seed production. 
10.2307/4040902|Potato fields were surveyed semi-monthly. Seedlings of barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crusgalli (L.) Beauv.) began to emerge as soon as the potatoes or shortly after. Emergence continued throughout the growing season. Barnyardgrass plants were most noticeable in the field in August and September when the potato vines started to lodge and much of the grass was headed.
10.2307/4040890|Tissue abnormalities in colonial bentgrass (Agrostis tenuis Sibth.) were observed after foliage applications at normal doses of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 2-(2, 4, 5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid (silvex), or 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-butyric acid [4-(2,4-DB)]. They included proliferations of the pericycle, hypertrophic cortical cells, and massed lateral root and root hair formations. The abnormalities usually resulting from phenoxy rates of 1, 1-1/2, or 3 pounds active per acre were often followed by death of the bentgrass within 20 days after treatment.
10.2307/4040891|Studies in New Mexico showed basal and stump applications of ester and oil-soluble amine formulations of 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid (silvex) to be effective for control of saltcedar (Tamarix pentandra Pall.). Trees with trunks 2 inches or larger in diameter were harder to kill than smaller trees and retreatment was often needed. Spraying the lower 2 feet was no more effective than spraying the lower foot. Cutting the larger trees and spraying the stump increased effectiveness.
10.2307/4040883| P was injected into the soil at specific locations to allow determination of the phosphorus uptake pattern of Phaseolus vulgaris (snap bean), Amaranthus retroflexus (pigweed), and Setaria viridis (green foxtail). All species absorbed phosphorus primarily from the top 6 inches of soil. Bean absorbed phosphorus from a zone of relatively small volume. Pigweed roots showed the greatest amount of lateral spread and foxtail roots the deepest soil penetration. One, two, three, or four plants of each of the above-mentioned species were grown 6 inches from a test bean plant to evaluate the effects of associated plants on the phosphorus uptake of the test bean. The effects observed were quite different for the three species studied. 
10.2307/4040895| Mature yellow foxtail [Setaria glauca (L.) Beauv.] infestations, growing in rows of corn, were harvested in 3 foot segments from paired 30 foot rows of corn. Basic analyses of variance were calculated so that the variances of plot sizes involving multiples of 3 feet could be determined and compared. Precision indices were calculated for harvesting various fractions of the plot area. Loss of precision did not exceed 25 percent when only 40 percent of the total area was harvested in random samples of 1-row  3 feet, or in multiples of this basic unit. Practical implications of the findings are related to estimates of weed yields in crop-weed ecology studies and herbicide evaluation tests. 
10.2307/4040901|Whenever moisture and temperature were favorable for germination, new seedlings of field dodder (Cuscuta campestris Yunck.) emerged each week for two years after seeding in the field or greenhouse. Many viable seeds probably remained in the soil, because 10% or less of the seeds produced seedlings.
10.2307/4040876|Combinations of row spacings, tillage, and herbicides were evaluated on Clark soybeans grown on Mexico silt loam. Weeds were not always completely controlled with 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben) or sodium pentachlorophenate (PCP). When herbicides were used, soybeans in 20- and 24-inch rows usually needed no more than one cultivation, while those in 32- and 40-inch rows usually needed at least one and sometimes two cultivations for good weed control and high soybean yields. Soybeans in narrow rows always equalled and sometimes produced higher yields than those in wide rows. The soybean canopy covered the ground more rapidly in narrow rows than in wide rows so that when herbicides suppressed early weed growth, less weeds were produced in narrow rows than in wide rows. In some situations, cultivations increased soybean yields when few or no weeds were present.
10.2307/4040888|Giant foxtail (Setaria faberii Herrm.) was seeded the day the crop was planted and 3, 6, 9, and 12 weeks later. Foxtail that began growing with the crop and was left to maturity reduced corn yields 13% and soybean yields 27%. Foxtail seeded 3 weeks or later after the crop was planted did not cause yield reductions in corn or soybeans. Although not competitive, foxtail seeded 3 weeks after corn was planted produced 500 pounds of dry matter per acre, and all seedlings in corn produced seed. Soybeans produced more shade than corn, and foxtail from the 3-week or later seedings in soybeans produced little or no dry matter or seed.
10.2307/4040903| Treatment of little barley (Hordeum pusillum Nutt.) at early-tillering stages with 0.25 to 0.5 lb/A of 1,1-dimethyl-4,4-dipyridylium cation paraquat, surfactant gave satisfactory to complete control of little barley and other annual weed species. Except under unfavorable seasonal conditions, atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine) also gave good control of little barley but was ineffective against other established weed species. Coastal bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L) Pers.] was not injured by atrazine and only temporarily by paraquat. 
10.2307/4040887| Exposures of trifluralin, , -trifluoro-2,6-dinitro-N,N-dipropyl-p-toluidine, coated on glass and soil surfaces were made to sunlight and to artificial light from a mercury-vapor source having a wavelength range of 300-700 millimicrons. Ultraviolet absorption spectra of irradiated samples exhibited progressive change with time and intensity of exposure. Exposures on a glass surface to sunlight for four to six hours resulted in a decrease in the plant growth inhibitory activity of trifluralin. Exposures on soil surfaces also indicated that photodegradation occurs, but at a much reduced rate. 
10.2307/4040897|Factors influencing injury to oats from 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) and 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) residues in the soil were studied over a period of five years. Initial rate of triazine application was highly important with significant injury in about one-half of the trials on plots treated with 2 lb/A the year prior to planting oats, and on all plots treated at 4 lb/A. No material difference was found on plots treated with equivalent rates of atrazine and simazine. Granular preparations of atrazine left a residue that was more injurious than wettable powders. Disking the seedbed for oats, rather than plowing, resulted in greater injury. Cultivation of the corn between the rows after treatment did not influence the injury the following year. Soil type did not have a marked effect on injury in this study. Above-normal average mean air temperatures appeared to reduce injury the following year in some instances. Experiments initiated in years of abundant rainfall during April to October tended to have less injury the next year than experiments initiated in years when rainfall was limited.
10.2307/4040889|There were usually no significant differences in weed and crop yields between plots receiving aerial and ground applications of herbicides. Where differences were found, aerial application was the more effective.
10.2307/4040881| The preemergence herbicide N, N-dimethyl-2, 2-diphenylacetamide (diphenamid) alone and in combination with the contact herbicides 1,1-dimethyl-4, 4-bipyridinium salt (paraquat) and 3, 4-dichloropropionanilide (propanil) was studied over three years. Application at planting and crop emergence (delayed preemergence) were compared. Weed control and crop tolerance were equally effective at either stage in tomatoes. Delayed preemergence applications of contact materials alone were erratic as herbicides but were more effective in peppers than in tomatoes. At emergence, combinations were more effective. Selectivity of propanil lessened when the cotyledons of tomato expanded fully. 
10.2307/4040899|Six herbicides were applied to young stands of Kentucky bluegrass at weekly intervals in treatments beginning 5, 7, 9 and 11 weeks after seeding bluegrass. In both years the arsenical containing herbicides were effective when applications were started 7, 9 or 11 weeks after seeding. Applications started five weeks after seeding were unsuccessful in 1962 but gave excellent control in 1963. Reduced stands of Kentucky bluegrass and generally poorer crabgrass control were obtained with phenyl mercuric acetate than with the arsenicals.
10.2307/4040900|Dodder seedlings become attached to another plant by first twining about some part of the host. Twining is dependent on action of light. Chlorophyll also forms after exposure to light. Diuron [3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea] was applied to dodder seedlings to determine the nature of light action in twining. Diuron had no effect on twining but blocked photosynthesis.
10.2307/4040892|In 1:1 slurry, adsorption of 2-chloro-4,6-bis (ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) by acid soils from saturated solution varied from 13 to 90%. Percent of adsorption from more dilute solutions was approximately that from the saturated solution. The adsorption of simazine by 18 soils was not correlated significantly with soil pH, but was correlated significantly with percent clay and highly significantly with organic matter and titratable acidity. Simazine was considered to be adsorbed by soils by proton association. Using titratable acidity as a measure of H-soil, equilibrium constants were calculated which did not vary greatly as a result of changes in acidity up to pH 8.5, or as a result of concentration of simazine in the added solution. Leon, the most adsorptive of the tested soils, gave values for the equilibrium constant that were somewhat higher than for four other soils. Simazine penetrated more deeply into limed soil than into unlimed soil. Liming reduced the decomposition of simazine as did intermittent drying. Recovery decreased with time.
10.2307/4040886| The atomization of jet streams from circular orifices, 279, 483, and 1016 microns in diameter, was measured under operating pressures less than 5 psi. The jet streams disintegrated into uniform large drops approximately twice the diameter of the jet orifice, and small drops making up less than 1% of the liquid volume from the small jet. About 80% of the spray from a jet discharging horizontally was deposited in a band 2 inches wide. The distribution pattern of horizontal jet streams positioned on a 2 inch spacing was improved by angling the jet streams 10-15 from the direction of travel. 
10.2307/4040896| Linuron (3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methoxy-1-methylurea) and diphenamid (N,N-dimethyl-2,2-diphenylacetamide) were applied at 5 and 25 lb/A to 13-  3-inch columns of Wheeling sandy loam and Maury silt loam soils and leached with 1, 2, 4, and 8 inches of water. Linuron remained at or near the soil surface; diphenamid was leached more readily. 
10.2307/4040884|A 4-year study was made at Huntley, Montana. When the seed coats were ruptured, 100% germination of sago pondweed (Potomogeton pectinatus L.) seeds occurred. Tubers grow in soil to a depth of 18 inches. Formation of tubers was greatest in August. Single plants of sago pondweed, grown from a tuber and a seed, in 6 months developed over 36,000 tubers and 63,000 seeds, respectively. Tubers survived winter temperatures well when buried in the soil. When dipped in paraffin tubers survived up to four years in storage.
10.2307/4040877|Maximum castorbean (Ricinus communis L.) yields were obtained from combinations of chemical and mechanical treatments. The rotary hoe controlled weeds when used preemergence and during the early stages of crop growth. The flame cultivator gave preemergence weed control and was selective on weeds less than four to five inches tall after castorbeans had attained a height of 12 to 14 inches. The cultivator controlled weeds between castorbean rows, but weeds were occasionally found within the row. 2-Chloroallyl diethyldithiocarbamate gave unsatisfactory preemergence weed control. Ethyl N,N-dipropylthiolcarbamate (EPTC) gave excellent weed control, injured castorbeans at 3 lb/A, but not at 2 lb/A. N-1-naphthylpthalamic acid at 4 lb/A gave good early weed control.
10.2307/4040885| On three soils, 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben) at 1.5 and 15 ppmw did not inhibit the nitrifying microflora, but 150 and 1500 ppmw significantly reduced the nitrate nitrogen produced by the soil microflora. No breakdown of amiben in liquid media was detected during 70 days. Amiben had a net minus charge in solution, and traveled at about the same rate on paper strips in electrophoresis as the dye brilliant blue. The organic matter content of soil was the property most closely associated with adsorption of C-labeled amiben. Only kaolinite, of four clays studied, adsorbed amiben significantly. There was no volatilization of amiben from stainless steel planchets stored at temperatures of 15, 25 or 35 C and relative humidities of 0, 33, 66, or 100 per cent. 
10.2307/4040894|The control of blue oak (Quercus douglasii H. & A.) was investigated by cut surface applications of water-soluble amine formulations of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T), 2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)propionic acid (2,4-DP), 2-(2,4-5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid (silvex); ester formulations of 2,4,5-T and silvex; potassium salt of 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram); and ammonium sulfamate. All phenoxy herbicides were relatively effective in controlling blue oak; the least favorable results were obtained with undiluted ester forms of 2,4,5-T and silvex, and ammonium sulfamate. Picloram was more effective than the water-soluble amine salts of 2,4-D on both blue oak and madrone (Arbutus mensiesii Pursh). Relatively favorable results were obtained on madrone by single-point applications to stems with picloram. Applications to holes 1 inch deep were more effective than when applied in deeper or shallower holes. Diluting alkanolamine salts of 2,4-D with water and butoxyethanol ester of 2,4,5-T with diesel oil had a generally depressing effect on kill (except for the first dilution of the ester). Plant kill decreased as the diameters of the trees increased. Rainwater analyses did not furnish an explanation for the marked increase in growth of the grass beneath the treated trees.
10.2307/4041155|An apparatus for trapping the vapors of ethyl N,N-dipropylthiolcarbamate (EPTC) and other herbicides froms soils under field conditions is described. The herbicide vapors were collected in cooled traps along with ice crystals, identified by gas chromatography and determined quantitatively. The amount of EPTC lost and trapped in 30 minutes ranged from 22 to 38% of that applied to the surface of six different types of wet soils. The amount lost from dry soils was much less than from moist soils. Letting the surface of six different types of wet soils. The amount lost from dry soils was much less than from moist soils. Letting the surface of freshly worked moist soil dry out to depth of 1/2 inch before spraying with EPTC, greatly reduced the loss by vaporization. Immediate incorporation prevented any loss of EPTC from dry soil and greatly reduced the loss from moist soils. After spraying EPTC on dry soil, sprinkling with small amounts of water increased the loss. Comparison of several thiolcarbamate herbicides showed that n-propyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (R-1607) and n-propyl ethyl-n-butylthiolcarbamate (PEBC) were lost by vaporization at a slower rate than EPTC, and S-ethyl hexahydro-l-Hazepine-l-carbothioate (R-4572) was lost at a much slower rate than the other herbicides tested.
10.2307/4041156|The disappearance of EPTC (ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate) from soils was studied by steam distilling the remaining EPTC from the soil samples and analyzing the distillates. The most important factor affecting the loss of EPTC from soil was the amount of moisture in the soil. During the first 15 minutes after spraying on the soil surface, 20% of the applied EPTC disappeared from dry soil, 27% from moist soil and 44% from wet soil. The loss was 23, 49, and 69% after one day and 44, 68, and 90% after six days on dry, moist, and wet soils, respectively. No significant loss of EPTC occurred the first few hours after applying granular EPTC to dry soil or soil containing 4 to 6% moisture, but on soil at 15% moisture the loss from granules was 60% in two hours. There appeared to be a critical moisture level for each soil, above which large losses of EPTC occurred after application to the surface or after shallow incorporation. Depth of incorporation was the second most important factor in EPTC loss from soils. Incorporation to at least 2 to 3 inches was necessary to prevent large losses of EPTC when light rain or sprinkler irrigation followed treatment. EPTC was lost at a faster rate on sunny days than cloudy days. Increasing the temperature from 32 to 60 F, increased the rate of EPTC vaporization from moist soil but had no effect on the loss from dry soil.
10.2307/4041145|Root moisture extraction profiles varied from 20 square feet for Kochia scoparia (L.) Schrad, (kochia to 44 square feet for Xanthium pennsylvanicum Wallr. (cocklebur). Weeds within the extremes with increasing root moisture extraction profiles were Eragrostis pectinacea (Michx) Ness (tufted lovegrass), Solanum rostratum Dunal. (buffalobur), Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop. (large crabgrass), Tribulus terrestris L. (puncturevine), Salsola kali L., var. tenuifolia Tausch (Russian thistle), Amaranthus palmeri S. Wats. (Palmer amaranth) and sorghum.
10.2307/4041151|Anionic and cationic surfactants differentially enhanced the phytotoxicities of four herbicides to corn and soybeans in relation to variations in their structure. Thirteen ionic and two related nonionic surfactants were studied in sprays containing water-soluble forms of 2,2-dichloropropionic acid [dalapon], 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid [2,4-D], 4,6-dinitro-o-sec-butylphenol [DNBP], and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole [amitrole]. Effects of surfactant structure, type, and concentration on two other spray properties-surface tension and specific conductivity-were measured at three pH conditions. Appreciable enhancement of herbicide toxicities occurred only at the highest concentration, 1.0 g per 100 ml (1.0 percent). With straight-chain isomers of an alkylbenzenesulfonate (ABS) anionic surfactant, enhancement of all herbicides increased as the position of the benzene ring was moved to the mid-chain (C5 and C6) carbons of an n-dodecyl alkyl group. DNBP toxicity to both species and surfactant toxicities to soybeans were increased progressively in separate odd- and even-carbon series, i.e. a C1,3,5-series and a C2,4,6-series. Other ABS variations which provided marked enhancement were use of a highly-branched dodecyl alkyl and substitution of an ester oxygen atom for the benzene ring. Among ethoxylated alkylamine cationic surfactants, variations in alkyl structure affected differentially the toxicities of the various herbicides at alkaline, neutral, and acid pH. Surfactants caused marked modification of physical-chemical properties of sprays in relation to their structure and concentration. However, no one of the properties studied could be correlated consistently with the herbicidal effectiveness of a spray. Results suggested that spray performance of herbicide formulations can be improved by using more effective surfactants to achieve other desired formulation characteristics. The increased toxicity of 2,4-D in certain alkaline sprays also suggested that the conditions necessary for absorption of 2,4-D should be examined more critically.
10.2307/4041150|In greenhouse experiments high levels of phosphorus tended to suppress growth of soybeans, oats, and foxtail in the presence of 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) as compared to controls containing no simazine. However, this relationship was not significant, varying with the soil used in the experiment. Emergence of the seedling was delayed and the concentration of ions in solution increased as phosphorus applications were increased. Mineral uptake by soybean shoots was unaffected by phosphorus or simazine alone, but markedly disrupted in the presence of both simazine and phosphorus. Changes in mineral uptake were typical of effects produced by phosphorus toxicity, indicating that simazine reduced the amount of phosphorus required to produce salt injury.
10.2307/4041161|The morphological symptoms of 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) and 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron) toxicity were expressed in the light but not in the dark. Various wavelengths of narrow band light were produced by the use of colored plastic filters. Oats, var Kanota, and red kidney beans were used. The degree of injury was a function of light intensity, the higher the light intensity the greater the injury. The action spectrum indicated that chlorophyll was the principal absorbing pigment involved in this injury.
10.2307/4041164|A plastic envelope device is described which allows separate exposure of seeds, roots, and coleoptiles of emerging grass seedlings to soil-incorporated herbicides.
10.2307/4041154| Soybeans treated preemergence with carboxyl-labeled C amiben (3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid) were harvested at 7-day intervals. The C activity per gram of dry plant matter decreased with later harvest dates but the activity per plant increased over the period. The cotyledons had considerable radioactivity. Both rates contained the same amount of C amiben but the soybeans exposed to 6 lb/A contained a significantly higher C count than did those exposed to 3 lb/A. All of the identifiable C components were amiben. Most of the activity in soybeans from seed imbibed with C amiben remained in the cotyledons. That which did translocate was evenly distributed. Most (98.1%) of the radioactivity in plants grown in treated nutrient solution remained in the roots. Translocated C amiben appeared about 8 days after exposure and was evenly distributed in the top of the plant. Plant-respired CO had no radioactivity present. 
10.2307/4041143|Preemergence applications of DCPA (dimethyl 2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalate) controlled germinating seedlings of largeseed dodder (Cuscuta indecora Choisy) in alfalfa, and the control continued throughout the season. Applications of DCPA were necessary prior to germination of dodder seed. Under California conditions, applications of DCPA made during early winter (December) provided early season control but not satisfactory control throughout the season as was accomplished with the March treatments. Autoradiographic studies showed only limited movement of tracer in alfalfa plants.
10.2307/4041152|Structural characteristics of surfactants and a herbicide were incorporated in the same molecule by forming longchain alkylamine salts of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid [2,4-D]. In water sprays, all of the 2,4-D salts showed surface activities characteristic of surfactants. The application rate of 2,4-D was held constant at 1/16 lb ae/A; salt concentration was varied by varying spray volume. Seventeen salts were herbicidally active on soybeans at a high concentration (1/16 lb ae in 10 gpa of spray) and a few were also active at a lower concentration (1/16 lb ae in 40 gpa). The remaining thirteen salts were relatively inactive in water. Structural features associated with water-active salts of 2,4-D were those which contribute to hydrophilic characteristics of surfactants. Lipophilic structural features contributed to inactivity in water. The 2,4-D toxicity of fourteen water-active and water-inactive salts of 2,4-D was maximally and equally elicited in one or more of six water and oil spray systems. Differential activities of the salts permitted their classification into six distinct classes-three hydrophilic and three lipophilic. No one of five solution properties-surface tension, interfacial tension, turbidity, specific conductivity, or pH-could be correlated with herbicidal toxicity of a spray. However, a combination of three properties-interfacial tension, turbidity, and specific conductivity-provided some indication of the relative hydrophilic or lipophilic character of a salt and of the 2,4-D toxicity in different sprays. Data suggested that herbicides move into plants by two distinct pathways-one hydrophilic and the other lipophilic.
10.2307/4041160|Alhagi pseudalhagi (Bieb.) Desv. (camelthorn) was in troduced into California about 1915, and into the State of Washington about 1935. Here, it was declared a primary noxious weed in 1955. Seeds scarified with sulfuric acid germinated 90-98 per cent at 25 C. Some seeds were viable after burial one year in soil or submergence for 9 months in running water. Seedlings in the infested area were found only in bovine manure. Tests indicated scarification and transportation of seed in the rumen could accelerate the spread of camelthorn. Lack of favorable moisture and soil temperature at the same time prevented establishment of camelthorn planted at several locations. Eradication resulted from treatment with 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA). Three repeated sprays with esters of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) within a growing season gave control; however, control did not appear to be directly related to depletion of reserve foods in the roots.
10.2307/4041159| S-propyl-1-C-N,N-ethyl n-butylthiolcarbamate (PEBC-C) residue was generally higher in the roots than in the corresponding above-ground portions, and also greater in plants receiving a higher rate of treatment The concentration decreased as a function of time after treatment. The average values of PEBC residue in the fresh foliage, during the first two weeks after receiving a lay-by treatment at blooming stage, were 0.098, 0.465 and 0.860 ppm for 1, 4 and 8 lb/A rates respectively. No PEBC residue was found in fruits from plants receiving any rate of treatment at blooming stage. A small amount of the residue was found in fruits from plants treated at early fruiting stage and this decreased rapidly to zero level after four or five weeks. The metabolic breakdown of PEBC in the tomato foliage and fruits is a first-order process. The rate constant for PEBC breakdown seemed to depend upon the tissue as well as the stage of growth. 
10.2307/4041146|Canada thistle [Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.] infestations were treated with 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron) at 10 rates ranging from 5 to 160 lb/A. Depths to which monuron leached were determined annually by bioassays with flax, peas and wheat. Toxicity at all rates continued for 3 years. The low sand, high clay, and high organic matter contents of this soil combined with cool or dry climatic conditions inhibited leaching and prolonged the toxicity of monuron.
10.2307/4041141|The various descriptive names used in the literature for each bulb type of wild garlic are reviewed and a suggested standard system of bulb nomenclature is presented. The life cycle of the species is briefly reviewed, with emphasis on cycles between plant and bulb types. The morphology, anatomy, ontogeny and physiology of the common bulb types are compared.
10.2307/4041153|Castorbeans (Ricinus communis L.) are extremely tolerant of the rotary hoe. Its timely use plus cultivation gave effective weed control in castorbeans. The preemergence herbicides, used either alone or in combination, that appeared most promising for selective control of weeds in castorbeans were: 2-chloro-N,N-diallylacetamide (CDAA), dimethyl-2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalic acid (DCPA), ethyl N,N-dipropylthiolcarbamate (EPTC), N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA), 2,6-dinitro-N,N-dipropyl-alpha, alpha, alpha-trifluoro-p-toluidine (trifluralin), and propyl dipropylthiolcarbamate (R-1607). The most dependable weed control practice in castorbeans was the use of preemergence herbicides in combination with rotary hoeings plus cultivation.
10.2307/4041144| Mugwort (Ariemisia vulgaris L.) was controlled by soil applications of potassium azide at 100 lb/A and equimolecular amounts of sodium azide in greenhouse studies. Rooted Artemisia plants exposed to exponential concentration ranges of these herbicides in 1/4 strength Knops nutrient solution showed lethal effects at 10 M of either the potassium or sodium azide. Vapors of the potassium and sodium azides caused leaf injury at relatively low rates. Bioassays indicated dissipation of 100 lb/A of the azides in the soil in 6 weeks under greenhouse conditions. 
10.2307/4041157| The sensitivity of giant duckweed (Spirodela polyrhyza (L.) Schleid), common duckweed (Lemna minor L.), Wolffiella floridana (Smith) Thomp., azolla (Azolla caroliniana Willd.), and watermeal (Wolffia columbiana Karst.) to diquat (6, 7-dihydrodipyrido [1,2-a:2,1-c] pyrazidiinium salt) and paraquat (1,1-dimethyl-4,4-bipyridinium salt) was in that order (most to least sensitive). The rapidity of chlorosis in giant duckweed was directly related to the light intensity. The light quality having the most effect on the activity of diquat and paraquat on duckweed was red (600+ millimicrons), and green (510-560 millimicrons) had the least effect. 
10.2307/4041148| The effect of temperature and relative humidity on root and foliar uptake of C-labeled atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine) in quackgrass (Agropyron repens (L.) Beauv.) was studied in a controlled environment growth chamber. Uptake and translocation of root-fed atrazine increased as temperature increased. Greater uptake and translocation of root-fed atrazine occurred under low relative humidity than under high relative humidity. Slightly greater uptake and translocation of foliar-applied atrazine occurred as temperature was increased from 60 to 80 F. 
10.2307/4041162|These herbicides at rates of .01 to .25 lb/A caused moderate to severe morphological effects on soybeans and significant yield reductions. Soybeans treated in the vegetative stage were injured more than those treated in the bloom stage. The herbicide 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid (silvex) injured soybeans most followed by 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-butyric acid (2,4-DB), in that order.
10.2307/4041149|Lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.), redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), and white mustard (Brassica hirta L.) were highly susceptible to 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) regardless of the pretreatment light exposure to which they were subjected. These broadleaved weeds were slightly more susceptible to MCPA applied after a prolonged period of darkness. Neither total carbohydrate, reducing sugar, protein, nor amino acid contents at the time of spraying were associated with the susceptibility of mustard plants to MCPA. Floral bud development on Canada thistle was greatly reduced by MCPA applied at any time of the day to plants 9 and 12 inches tall and was prevented on plants 3 and 6 inches tall. The susceptibility of broadleaved annual weeds and Canada thistle to MCPA was not affected by variations in temperature and humidity at time of spraying.
10.2307/4041158| Downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.) control by 1,1-dimethyl-4,4-bipyridinium salt (paraquat) was increased from 12% without surfactant to 73 to 94% with 17 of 22 surfactants. Paraquat toxicity was greatest at 0.06 and 0.12% surfactant concentrations and decreased at higher concentrations. The less effective surfactants were less water-soluble and more lipophilic than related, more effective ones. 
10.2307/4041142| Combinations of 3-chloro-2-methyl-p-valerotoluidide (solan) with 1,1-dimethyl-4,4-dipyridylium cation (paraquat) were used postemergence in transplanted tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.). Addition of .05 lb/A of paraquat to 2 or 4 lb/A of solan resulted in more effective control of crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop.) than did doubling the rate of solan. The combinations were synergistic on crabgrass but only additive or more often antagonistic on tomato plants. The herbicides dimethyl 2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalate (DCPA) and sodium 2,4-dichlorophenoxyethyl sulfate (sesone) were applied for preemergence weed control in strawberry beds. Velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medic.) was resistant to both DCPA and to sesone, but was quite susceptible to the combination. Combinations of 4,6-dinitro-o-sec-butylphenol (DNBP) with 2-methoxy-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simetone) were highly synergistic on tomato plants. This synergism was more pronounced at low rates of herbicides. 
10.2307/4041147|In greenhouse tests, temperature, humidity, drought stress, and concentration of surfactant influenced the foliar activity of spray mixtures containing a dodecyl ether of polyethylene glycol (Surfactant WK) and 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl urea (diuron) or 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methoxy-1-methyl urea (linuron). In comparisons with other commonly used surfactants, Surfactant WK gave a superior performance when used in conjunction with diuron, linuron, and 5-bromo-3-sec-butyl-6-methyl uracil (bromacil). Increased water solubility of these herbicides in the presence of surfactant is only one factor among many involved in the enhanced activity of such combinations. Surfactant WK facilitated the deposition of high concentrations of linuron on leaf surfaces of Johnsongrass. Once a gradient was established, subsequent rapid movement of the herbicide into the leaf was noted.
10.2307/4041140|Toxicity to oats of atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine), simazine (2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine), diuron (3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea), monuron (3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea), and fenuron (3-phenyl-1,1-dimethylurea), exposed to sunlight on soil surface for 25 days was significantly decreased even when surface soil temperatures did not exceed 120 F. Only atrazine and monuron exhibited significantly less phytotoxicity after 60 days exposure than after 25 days. Simazine phytotoxicity also was significantly reduced when held on soil in the dark for 60 days. With the exception of fenuron, there was no difference between treatments within compounds when soil temperatures reached maximums as high as 180 F. Under these conditions, phytotoxicity of the herbicides was reduced 65 to 97 percent by all exposures.
10.2307/4041165|Atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine) and 2-chloro-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (propazine) affected oats and alfalfa in Nebraska planted the year following application to sorghum. No carry-over of 2-chloro-N,N-diallylacetamide (CDAA) + trichlorobenzyl (TCBC) was detected in oats and alfalfa. Intertillage of sorghum did not decrease herbicide residue.
10.2307/4041163|Listed on the basis of visual ratings in Sept. 1961, in the order of increasing toxicity to Kentucky bluegrass sown in April, 1961, and treated May 31 and June 6, the herbicides were 2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalic acid (DCPA), amine methylarsonate, diphenylacetonitrile (diphenatrile), calcium propylarsonate, disodium monomethylarsonate (DMA), N,N-dipropyl-2,6-dinitro-p-toluidine (dipropalin), calcium arsenate, O-(2,4-dichlorophenyl) O-methyl isopropylphosphoramidothioate (DMPA), polychlorodicyclopentadiene isomers, and alpha,alpha,alpha-trifluro-2,6-dinitro-N,N-dipropyl-p-toluidine (trifluralin). All herbicides except DCPA and DMPA (liquid) persisted after two years of use until March 1963 in the top 2 inches of soil.
10.2307/4041030| Doses required to reduce fresh weights of seedling oats 50 percent (ED) in 32 soils were determined for isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamate [CIPC], 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea [diuron], and 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine [simazine]. Physical and chemical properties of soils and the extent of adsorption of the three herbicides on the soils were also determined and evaluated by correlation and multiple regression analysis for usefulness in predicting dose requirements. Extent of adsorption was most closely correlated with ED values for diuron and simazine, but organic matter content was most closely correlated with ED values for CIPC. None of the soil properties nor the extent of adsorption provided consistent predictive value for all of the soils and herbicides studied. 
10.2307/4041042| Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) plants possess a high degree of tolerance to postemergence applications of 3-chloro-2-methyl-p-valerotoluidide (solan). Eggplant (Solanum Melongena L.) is highly susceptible to this herbicide. Differences in penetration, persistence and metabolism of solan by tomato and eggplant were insufficient to account for the differential susceptibility. Solan greatly inhibited the Hill reaction in isolated chloroplasts, and chloroplasts of both species were about equally sensitive to it. Radioactive solan (carbonyl labelled) sprayed on intact tomato and eggplant accumulated to about the same extent in chloroplasts of both species. The Hill reaction in isolated chloroplasts, carbon dioxide (CO) fixation in intact plants, and the level of high energy phosphates in intact plants were determined for tomato and eggplant previously sprayed with a selective rate of solan. Initially, all three reactions were inhibited in both species. Later, all three reactions returned to normal in tomato, but declined to a low level in eggplant. A resistant mechanism of cyclic photosynthetic phosphorylation was proposed as the mechanism of solan tolerance in tomato. Two types of light-activated solan injury were found. A rapid non-selective action, occurring at high doses of the herbicide, killed both tomato and eggplant. A delayed action occurred selectively on eggplant at low rates of herbicide. No solan injury occurred on plants placed in darkness after spraying, regardless of plant species or rate of herbicide applied. 
10.2307/4041027|Downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.), and rattail fescue (Festuca myuros L.) were controlled by 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (dicamba) and 2,4-bis(isoproplyamino)-6-methylmercapto-s-triazine (prometryne). Both herbicides gave 70-100% control when applied soon after the first postharvest irrigation. Dicamba was somewhat less effective when applied before this irrigation. Neither herbicide reduced seed yields when applied before or immediately after the first postharvest irrigation, but both herbicides caused some significant seed yield reductions when treatments were delayed until after considerable crop regrowth had occurred.
10.2307/4041023|Differences in the competitive effects of three major species of foxtail on soybeans were due primarily to differences in the mature plant yields of the species. Giant foxtail (Setaria Faberi) grew more vigorously and caused greater soybean yield reductions than did either yellow foxtail (Setaria lutescens) or green foxtail (Setaria viridis). The competitive effects of velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti) per cwt. of mature weeds were approximately double those of yellow and green foxtail, but produced about the same yield reduction.
10.2307/4041028|Effective chemical control of alligatorweed (Alternanthera philoxeroides (Mart.) Griseb.) has been prevented by rapid regeneration of plants from inactive axillary buds following treatment with herbicides. Destruction of phloem, cambium, and associated parenchyma occurred above and within the nodes of plants treated with 2 lb/A dichlobenil (2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile) or dicamba (2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid). Application of dichlobenil and dicamba in combination increased the extent of tissue destruction. Herbicidal activity was noted within the axillary buds only when vascular strands between bud and stem were well differentiated.
10.2307/4041033| A mitochondrial fraction isolated from cotyledons of etiolated Cucumis sativus L. (Burpee's Improved Long Green) showed respiratory activity roughly comparable to that of other reported plant mitochondrial systems. Published procedures on extraction, centrifugation, and determination of cofactor requirements were modified for this system to obtain maximum activity as measured by Warburg manometry. Succinic dehydrogenase activity in the fraction was inhibited by known inhibitors such as sodium azide, DNP, and hydroxymalonic acid; -ketoglutarate utilization was inhibited by sodium azide. Dichlobenil (2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile) consistently increased respiration (up to 162% of the controls, using 1.45  10 M dichlobenil in a succinate substrate mixture); 2,5-diiodo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile (ioxynil) consistently reduced O uptake at 0.75  10 to 0.75  10 M concentrations. Picloram (4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid) performed in a manner generally similar to the five following substituted benzoic acids: 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA); 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben); 3-nitro-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (dinoben); 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (dicamba); and 2-methoxy-3,5,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (tricamba). Using succinate as substrate, stepwise inhibition occurred in the range of 10 to 10 M herbicide; however, the -ketoglutarate system was much less sensitive to all compounds. For example, the effects of 10 M amiben and dicamba on -ketoglutarate utilization were essentially negligible. Six other herbicides studied showed either no effect or varying degrees of inhibition, depending upon concentration and substrate employed. Dichlobenil uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation at a 1.45  10 M concentration. 
10.2307/4041040| C ring-labeled atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine) was applied in nutrient solutions. Soybeans absorbed more atrazine per g of fresh weight than corn or cotton. The amount of atrazine absorbed by the plants increased with increases in atrazine concentration, in water absorption, and in length of absorption. Less atrazine was absorbed in the second than in the first 24-period with occasional indications of loss of atrazine back into the solution. CO evolution was not established for any plant although many different environmental conditions were tried. Degradation to CO is not a significant process for these plants under these conditions. 
10.2307/4041049| Indoleacetic acid (IAA) stimulates the incorporation of radioactivity derived from methionine-methyl-C into a fraction of sesbania hypocotyl that is insoluble in 80 per cent alcohol or 60 percent acetone, but is soluble in hot water. Incorporation of C into "hot water soluble material" was stimulated by IAA, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 2,5-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, naphthaleneacetic acid, 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid, 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid, 4-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid, and 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid. All compounds were stimulative at 1  10 M. 
10.2307/4041034| Diuron, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea-C moved primarily in the apoplast with the transpiration stream, and did not move with the plant assimilates of red kidney bean, soybean, and barley plants. There did not appear to be a species difference in absorption, distribution, and accumulation. Uptake and distribution increased progressively as duration of treatments increased from 6 hours to 16 days. No phloem movement and distribution was observed in the 16-day treatment time. The addition of a surfactant did not alter the translocation pattern of diuron. The evidence obtained from gross autoradiographs did not eliminate the possibility that very small amounts of diuron may get into the symplast. However, it did indicate that if diuron moved into the symplast, it was restricted and the movement of diuron out of the area of application by phloem was very limited. 
10.2307/4041031| A natural product in corn, the 2-glucoside of 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one, is capable of inactivating triazine herbicides. Two essentially isogenic corn lines, Mississippi selection GT112 (susceptible to atrazine and simazine) and GT112 RfRf (resistant), contained the compound in both roots and shoots. The content of the roots was about equal for the two lines and decreased with age. In shoots of GT112 seedlings 13 to 28 days old, the 2-glucoside content reduced with time to half the original value. In shoots of GT112 RfRf, the 2-glucoside content doubled from 13 to 17 days, then decreased. Shoots of GT112 RfRf contained 1.6, 3.6, and 2.4 times more 2-glucoside at 13, 17, and 28 days, respectively, than GT112. However, 13-day-old homogenized shoots of GT112 converted 1.8 times more atrazine per M of 2-glucoside than GT112 RfRf. Susceptibility of GT112 to triazine herbicides is not due to absence of the 2-glucoside or its inability to convert atrazine. 
10.2307/4041044|Several ring-substituted derivatives of benzoic acid inhibited pantothenate biosynthesis in Escherichia coli. The metabolic site of inhibition was the conversion of ketopantoate to pantoate. This action caused pantothenate-reversible reductions in growth only in strains of E. coli with inherent limited capacities for biosynthesis of ketopantoate. Inhibition of pantothenate biosynthesis was tentatively concluded to be of little physiological significance as a site of action responsible for herbicidal activities of benzoic acids.
10.2307/4041043|Germinable seeds were non-existent below 4 inches in the undisturbed soils used for cranberry bed development. Seeds were found at greater depths in manipulated soils. The seed in the vines used for planting was a major factor in the infestation of a properly scalped bed. Movement of seeds in water caused an infestation of a weed-free bed. The highest movement of seeds per acre-inch of water flow occurred in September, next highest in October and third highest in April. A relatively weed-free planting was maintained through one season by fumigating the soil for seed eradication, erecting a fine mesh screen exclosure to prevent weed invasion by flood water, and washing the vines prior to planting.
10.2307/4041029|Effects of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA) on plant numbers and on the reproductive bulbs were studied by counting plants and digging and examining the bulbs in soil cores. Foliar application of both herbicides resulted in necrosis, reduction in size, growth abnormalities (hardshell bulbs only), changes in the makeup of bulb population, and eventually a large decline in bulb numbers. Soft offset bulbs were damaged less than central bulbs by both herbicides. Soft offset bulbs increased in proportion to total bulb population following 2,3,6-TBA treatment. Both herbicides caused abnormal growth of developing hardshell bulbs and reduced viability. At the 2-lb rate, 2,3,6-TBA reduced hardshell bulb production more than 2,4-D; at 4 lb/A, 2,3,6-TBA prevented hardshell bulb production. Dormant hardshell bulbs of previous seasons' production were not affected by either herbicide. Plant populations declined more rapidly and to a lower level than bulb populations under adverse conditions of environment and herbicide treatments. The slower decline in bulb numbers resulted from dormancy in the hardshell bulbs.
10.2307/4041048|Seedlings of Siberian elm (Ulmus pumila L.) readily invade grasslands of the Southern Plains and are a serious economic problem. Siberian elm was not susceptible to foliage or basal sprays of phenoxy herbicides applied during 3 successive years. Individual trees were killed easily by 1 g (ai) per inch of trunk diameter of 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron) or 3-phenyl-1,1-dimethylurea (fenuron) applied in a ring around the tree. However, the dense population and rapidity of reinvasion make this treatment too expensive.
10.2307/4041032|Enhancement of 3(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron) toxicity to oat plants was not dependent on type-anionic, cationic, or nonionic-of surfactant. However, specific surfactant and concentration were important. Concentrations of surfactant above 0.1% were required for consistent phytotoxic effects. Concentration of diuron in solution at time of application was not an important factor in phytotoxicity. Lowering the temperature from 72 to 60 F slowed the expression of toxicity and increased the chances of plant recovery.
10.2307/4041022|The movement of chemicals in the soil caused by water percolation was treated in a manner analogous to the development of materials through chromatographic columns. A "slotted tube test" was developed, which simulated a miniature field plot, utilizing a chromatographic soil column and the growth of either seeds or an indicator organism in agar as the detector. It was found that the median effective dose was higher for the more strongly sorptive soils. When correlations were made between soil compositions and the corresponding median effective doses for nonionic organic molecules, virtually all of the variations in required dosages were accounted for by percent organic matter and water content. The "active fraction" of organic matter, that fraction concerned with sorption equilibria, appeared to be of the same nature in soils of various compositions from various sources. This provided a technique for calculating the percent "active" organic matter of soil.
10.2307/4041036|Effective control of Artemisia vulgaris L. (mugwort) was obtained with 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid (fenac) and 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram). Dimethylamine salt of 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (dicamba) gave control when applied in April when mugwort shoots were small. Dicamba was less effective later in the season even after clipping to obtain small new shoots. The amount of fenac necessary for effective control was reduced by mixing with dicamba, the butoxyethanol ester of 2.4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) or oleyl-1,3-propylenediamine salt of 2,4-D. Late in the season, fenac was more effective when applied after mowing than when applied to large mugwort. Soil incorporated ethyl N,N-dipropylthiolcarbamate and propyl dipropylthiolcarbamate reduced mugwort stands and rhizome weight; however, regrowth occurred in the same season.
10.2307/4041047|At Lincoln 20 lb/A of 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA) destroyed Clark soybeans five seasons after application. Soil persistence of 2,3,6-TBA in the light textured soils and low rainfall of western Nebraska was less than at Lincoln. A 10 lb/A rate of 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron) reduced weed and oat yields at Lincoln the third growing season after its application. Applications of 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine), 2-chloro-4,6-bis-(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine), or monuron at 10 lb/A reduced oat yields at North Platte the third growing season after their application. Herbicide carryover is a greater problem in arid than in humid regions of the United States.
10.2307/4041037|These herbicides for vegetables in three desert areas managed under furrow irrigation exhibited extreme variability between locations in herbicide response and crop toxicity. Some treatments provided a reasonable compromise between weed control and crop injury at any one location, none met this requirement at each location. Soil-type, soil moisture at time of herbicide application, and interaction of crops and environment probably contributed to the observed variability.
10.2307/4041038|Experiments of two types were conducted. (1) Weeds were allowed to grow for different periods after planting sugar beets; they were then removed and the beets hand-weeded until harvest. (2) Sugar beets were hand-weeded for different periods after planting; then no further weeding was done. Weed competition reduced beet yields up to 94%. Weeds that emerged soon after beet planting reduced yields the most, but they exerted little yield-reducing competition until later than 12 weeks after planting the beets (9 weeks after beet emergence). Full-season weed control resulted when beets were hand-weeded for 10 to 12 weeks after planting. Weeds that emerged later were controlled by crop competition.
10.2307/4041046|Herbicides incubated in Wymore silty clay loam soil at field capacity at 15, 25, and 35 C showed 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben) the most persistent, 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA) intermediate, and 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) the least persistent to microbial and/or chemical breakdown. All herbicides persisted much longer at 15 C than at 35 C. The average annual temperature below the plow layer is about 12 C. This helps explain the persistence of leached herbicides under field conditions.
10.2307/4041041|Three thiocarbamate herbicides, S-ethyl dipropylthiocarbamate, S-propyl dipropylthiocarbamate, and S-propyl butylethylthiocarbamate, applied at a depth of 1.5 inches in Tifton loamy sand were much more toxic to yellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus L.), sicklepod (Cassia tora L.), and Texas millet (Panicum texanum Buckl.) than when applied at 0.75 inches. The optimum depth of application may vary with different soils. Optimum subsurface placement was more effective than either soil incorporation or preemergence surface application.
10.2307/4041026|The most successful herbicides for control of downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.) in grassland were: 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole), 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine), 2-chloro-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (propazine), and 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine). More consistent downy brome control was obtained with atrazine than the other s-triazines. Amitrole improved postemergence control of the s-triazines in the tillering stage. Intermediate wheatgrass (Agropyron intermedium (Host.) Beauv.), crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum L. Gaertn.), western wheatgrass (Agropyron smithii Rydb.), blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis (H. B. K.) Lag.), and sedge (Carex spp.) appeared to be more sensitive to most s-triazines than needle-and-thread (Stipa comata Trin. & Rupr.) and sand dropseed (Sporobolus cryptandrus Torr.). Sand dropseed was extremely tolerant.
10.2307/4041025|In nutrient solution, 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA) was less toxic to oats than either 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (dicamba) or 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben). The latter two herbicides were similar in phytotoxicity. In soil, dicamba was the most phytotoxic in each of four soils used, while 2,3,6-TBA and amiben were similar in toxicity in all soils except the organic soil, in which amiben was less phytotoxic than 2,3,6-TBA. In the sandy soils the same amount of herbicide was required to reduce the growth of oats by 50% as was required in nutrient solution, but considerably higher amounts were required in the organic soil. This reduction in phytotoxicity was attributed to adsorption of the herbicides in an unavailable form by the organic matter of the soils, amiben being adsorbed to a greater extent than 2,3,6-TBA or dicamba. Practically no adsorption occurred on the clay colloids of the various soils. In persistence studies, amiben was more subject to apparent microbial decomposition than 2,3,6-TBA or dicamba. Decomposition was more rapid in the organic soil than in the clay or sandy soils. In leaching studies, the three herbicides were readily washed out of columns of the various soils. Differences in movement of herbicide in these soils could be related to the rate of water movement through the soil.
10.2307/4041045|The addition of 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) to nutrient solutions of corn (Zea mays L.) increased the percent of N and total mg of N in one test regardless of the N level in the solution. Under the low N level, the magnitude of this increase was 90 percent with 0.5 ppm simazine. However, in a second experiment, under environmental conditions more favorable for corn growth, the total mg of N was not increased, although the percent nitrogen in the shoots was increased at the lower nitrogen level. Corn plants treated with hydroxy simazine responded similarly to the controls.
10.2307/4041024|The photosynthetic capacities of three species of dodder, largeseed dodder (Cuscuta indecora, Choisy), field dodder (Cuscuta campestris, Yuncker), and small-seeded dodder (Cuscuta approximata, Bab.) were studied by radioactive carbon dioxide uptake in light and darkness, and by manometric methods. Both methods showed that all three species were able to carry on a small amount of photosynthesis. The photosynthetic capacity was highest in the seedling, and decreased as the dodder became parasitic.
10.2307/4041039|A Streptomyces, apparently S. viridochromogenes, was isolated from Louisiana crop areas where seven chlorinated herbicides had been used in weed control. It liberated no chloride when grown in a liquid medium containing 100 ppm of any of these seven herbicides. With a cucumber root bioassay, detoxification of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid (silvex), 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid (fenac), 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon) was observed, but little detoxification was shown with 2-chloro-N,N-diallylacetamide (CDAA), isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamate (CIPC), and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T). Manometric studies with 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, and silvex showed the streptomycete was capable of adapting to the compounds after a short period, but not to 2,4-dichlorophenol, a proposed intermediate of 2,4-D metabolism. The organism did not alter the ring structure of the aromatic herbicides, and 2,4-D and 2,4-dichlorophenol showed identical absorption curves with the spectrophotometer used.
10.2307/4041035| The herbicide 3,4-dichloropropionanilide (propanil) effectively controlled barnyardgrass [Echinochloa crusgalli (L.) Beauv.], brachiaria [Brachiaria platyphylla (Griseb.) Nash], crabgrass [Digitaria spp.], sesbania [Sesbania exaltata (Raf.) Cory], curly indigo [Aeschynomene virginica (L.) B.S.P.], spikerush [Eleocharis spp.], and umbrellasedge [Cyperus spp.] in the 1- to 4-leaf stages without significant injury to commercial varieties of rice in the 1- to 2-leaf stages. It was ineffective for control of ducksalad [Heteranthera spp.], redstem [Ammannia coccinea Rottb.], morningglory [Ipomoea spp.], sprangletop [Leptochloa panicoides (Presl.) Hitchc.], and red rice [Oryza sativa L.]. Mixtures of propanil and a blended surfactant, containing petroleum sulfonate, free and combined fatty acids, and petroleum oil, and mixtures of propanil and isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamate (CIPC) and methyl 2.4-dichlorocarbanilate (swep), controlled barnyardgrass better than propanil alone. Propanil sometimes injured the rice, but it recovered in 5 to 10 days after treatment and yield and quality were unaffected. 
10.2307/4040672|In agar cultures 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) reduced bud activity of quackgrass (Agropyron repens (L.) Beauv.) rhizomes, while indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) had little effect. Gibberellic acid (GA) acted antagonistically with NAA. Maleic hydrazide (MH) had less effect on bud activity than isopropyl N-phenylcarbamate (IPC), 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid (fenac), or phenoxy compounds at high rates. GA or its active metabolite was translocated throughout the plant. 2,3,5-Triiodobenzoic acid stimulated bud activity on intact rhizomes.
10.2307/4040687| The effect of mono-and dichlorophenyl analogs of N-phenyl-2-methylpentanamide (PMP) and N-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-alkylamides on the photolytic activity (Hill reaction) of chloroplasts isolated from turnip greens (Brassica spp.) was studied. Photochemical activity was measured potentiometrically with ferricyanide as the electron acceptor. PMP inhibited the Hill reaction by 50 percent (I) at 4.5  10 M. Monochlorination in the meta and para ring positions enhanced the inhibitory activity whereas chlorination in the ortho position negated inhibitory activity of the parent chemical (PMP). N-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-methylpentanamide (3,4-DCPMP) was the most inhibitory of the 6 dichlorinated isomers (I = 5.8  10 M). Replacement of the imino hydrogen of 3,4-DCPMP with a methyl group reduced inhibitory activity below that of the unsubstituted parent compound (PMP). Of the straight-chain N-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)alkylamides studied, the propanamide expressed maximum inhibition. 2-Methylalkylamides were more inhibitory than the corresponding straight-chain alkylamides. Maximum inhibition in the branched series was obtained with 3,4-DCPMP. Kinetic studies performed with 3,4-DCPMP at different light intensities indicated that both light and dark reactions were inhibited. However, the light reaction was more sensitive to the effects of the chemical. 
10.2307/4040684|Rough pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.) on the average emerged 2 days earlier than yellow foxtail (Setaria glauca (L.) Beauv.) The heading and maturity of both weeds seeded in corn was delayed for 3-4 days. The interval between emergence and maturity decreased progressively as seeding dates were delayed. The tallest plants and the highest yields were produced from the early spring seedings. Competition from corn depressed yields of both weeds more than their heights. Height and yield of foxtail seeded during July were most affected. In later seedings foxtail tolerated corn competition much better than pigweed.
10.2307/4040686|Herbicide experiments conducted on flowering size gladiolus corms over a four year period have shown that 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) at 1 lb/A preemergence and 1 lb/A at lay-by; ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (EPTC), 6 lb/A preemergence and 6 lb/A at lay-by; or 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron) either 1 lb/A preemergence and 1 lb/A at lay-by or 2 lb/A at lay-by appear to be safe and effective herbicides for weed control on varieties Spic & Span, Valeria, Hopman's Glory, Spotlight, Elizabeth the Queen, Friendship, and White Excelsior.
10.2307/4040680|Dalapon (2,2-dichloropropionic acid) was applied as basally directed sprays to field grown cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. var. Acala 4-42). Herbicidal rates of dalapon applied after heavy boll development (approximately 105 days after planting) were noninjurious; earlier applications appeared hazardous. Three or six pounds of dalapon per acre applied during early square or full flowering caused no noticeable injury symptoms but delayed maturity and reduced cotton yields in proportion to dosage. Analysis of eight seed and fiber properties showed no significant differences among treatments except for minor shifts attributable to dalapon-induced changes in maturity. Germination of seed from treated cotton was measurably retarded but final viability was not reduced. The retarding influence persisted for more than two years in storage. Accumulation of 8 to 21 ppm dalapon in the seeds was demonstrated by colorimetric and isotope dilution methods of analysis.
10.2307/4040683|Field studies at three locations across Nebraska showed that 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA) leached readily into the soil profile. The herbicide was lost from the surface soil much more readily in central and western Nebraska than in eastern Nebraska even though rainfall was about twice as much at the last location. Volatilization was suggested as a possible reason for this loss of 2,3,6-TBA. There was a definite, but not complete, loss of 2,3,6-TBA from the three soil profiles between May 1960 and September 1961. Soybeans proved to be an acceptable bioassay plant for this herbicide in soil at 2,3,6-TBA concentrations of 1/2 to 2 ppmw.
10.2307/4040682| Measurements of C-labeled 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid absorbed and translocated from treated leaves of blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica Muenchh.) showed that absorption and translocation were highest in early spring and decreased during May and June, so that there was a minimum at about the first of July. Absorption and translocation increased during July, August, and September. Measurements of soil moisture did not reveal a correlation of water stress and translocation rates. Extensive variations in the respiration rates of the leaf tissue occurred during the growing season. The trends in respiration rates generally paralled the trends in translocation rates. 
10.2307/4040678|Treatment of woollyleaf franseria, Franseria tomentosa Gray, with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) at three locations in Nebraska showed that June treatments were much more effective in reducing the stand than those made in July and August. The isopropyl ester and butoxyethanol ester of 2,4-D were somewhat more effective than the triethanolamine salt. Rates of 2 and 4 lb/A gave the most consistent results.
10.2307/4040690|Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamate (CIPC), 2-chloroallyl diethyldithiocarbamate (CDEC), ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (EPTC), sodium 2,4-dichlorophenoxyethyl sulfate (sesone), and N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) controlled Amaranthus palmeri S. Wats., (Palmer amaranth) Echinochloa colonum (L.) Link, (junglerice) and Sorghum vulgare Pers. var. sudanense Hitchc. (sudangrass) more efficiently when applications were followed by overhead irrigation, except in a few instances where weeds were controlled regardless of the irrigation method. More CIPC, sesone, CDEC, and EPTC penetrated below 1/4 inch into soils, and they penetrated deeper with overhead irrigation.
10.2307/4040688|Most of the elongation responsible for barnyardgrass seedling emergence occurred in the first internode. The developing foliar leaves within the coleoptile were the consistent site of EPTC injury. Injury symptoms were never observed in the roots. The first internodes of EPTC-injured seedlings seemed to function normally, although they were sometimes kinked into zig-zag patterns. This kinking was a secondary rather than a direct effect of EPTC injury. Seed germination was not affected by EPTC. Injury occurred after germination. Exposing the seed and primary root to EPTC did not lead to injury, whereas exposing the shoot or only the coleoptile did. It was concluded that leaf tissue is the main site of EPTC uptake in barnyardgrass as well as the prime site of injury.
10.2307/4040673|Polychlorobenzoic acids (PBA), 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA), and 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid (fenac) sprays were applied safely for the eradication of perennial weeds at not over 20 pounds per square inch in winds less than 11 miles per hour in and near cotton. Use of these herbicides near soybeans was hazardous because very small quantities of them caused leaf deformities and some loss in seed yield.
10.2307/4040681|The interaction of soil applied phosphorus and soil applied herbicides was investigated in field, greenhouse and controlled environment chamber studies. A previously reported diuronphosphorus interaction could not be repeated under all conditions studied. Amitrole was consistently more toxic to plants grown under high phosphorus levels than under low phosphorus conditions. The phytotoxicity of ten other herbicides was not influenced by the phosphorus content of the soil.
10.2307/4040675|Smooth bromegrass, Bromus inermis, and red fescue, Festuca rubra, were sown in 1952 on a fertile soil severely infested with yellow toadflax, Linaria vulgaris Mill., in the Peace River section of Alberta. Annual applications of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) were made at late flower-bud stage at nil, 1, 2, 3, and 4 lb/A acid equiv. In 1958, the average per cent of toadflax in the brome was 1, 0.5, 0.5, 0, and 0, respectively. Red fescue had 6 to 0.1% of toadflax. All rates of 2,4-D prevented seed production. The sods were broken in 1959, and toadflax re-established strongly on all plots from dormant seed and residual plants. In 1961, the brome, rejuvenated by breaking, strongly suppressed toadflax, while fescue failed to compete with it.
10.2307/4040671| Optimum temperature for bud activity and shoot growth of quackgrass (Agropyron repens (L.) Beauv.) occurred between 20 and 27 C. CO and O gas concentrations normally occurring in soil air were not found to affect bud activity and shoot growth appreciably. 
10.2307/4040677| Techniques were developed for evaluating herbicides on submersed, floating, and emersed aquatic weeds. Among 75 herbicides evaluated on three species of submersed weeds only 1:1-ethylene-2:2-dipyridylium (diquat); 1:1-dimethyl-4:4-dipyridylium (paraquat); di-N,N-dimethylcocoamine salt of 3,6-endoxohexahydrophthalic acid (endothal); and acrylaldehyde (acrolein) gave 85 percent or better control at 1 ppmw in still-water tests. Only acrolein and the di-N,N-dimethylcocoamine salt of endothal were effective on submersed weeds at 1 ppmw in the limited-exposure test. The evaluation of 17 herbicides on three species of floating aquatic weeds indicated that diquat was effective when applied at rates of 1 or 2 lb/A. The tertiary fatty acid amines of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) were more effective on floating weeds than an ester of 2,4-D. Many of the 78 herbicides evaluated on alligatorweed (Alternanthera philoxeroides (Mart.) Griseb.) killed the tops, but only two retarded the sprouting of underwater nodes longer than 6 weeks. Applications of 20 lb/A of 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)-propionic acid (silvex) in two formulations retarded sprouting of underwater nodes for 8 weeks. 
10.2307/4040674|Herbicidal control of tall larkspur, Delphinium occidentale Wats. was investigated in the Sawtooth National Forest near Oakley, Idaho. When larkspur was in a prebud stage, 4 and 8 lb/A of the propylene glycol butyl ether esters of 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid (silvex) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) gave good control, with significant increases in yield of native grasses. At the bud and flower stages neither herbicide gave satisfactory control at 12 lb/A. Granular silvex at 400 lb/A total product (80 lb/A ae) killed all larkspur with only slight injury to rabbitbrush, sagebrush, and native grasses. A chlorate-borate (25%-75%) mixture gave a complete larkspur kill at 1740 lb/A.
10.2307/4040685|The toxicity to bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus, Rafinesque) of 3 to 21 commercial formulations of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T), 2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)propionic acid [2-(2,4-DP)], and 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid (silvex) was determined. The variations among formulations of the same herbicide were much greater than those among different herbicides. Variations in toxicity of a single formulation were also noted. Formulations of each herbicide were reported as either safe or unsafe for aquatic applications. Amine salts were generally less toxic to fish than esters. The formulation selected for use should be assayed prior to field application, using the receiving water.
10.2307/4040689|Foliar applications using volumes of 100 to 500 ml per acre were used to determine the effect of droplet size on herbicide toxicity to five plant species. Several types of plant response were used to indicate effectiveness. Herbicide toxicity increased as the particle diameter decreased from 0.3 mm to 0.1 mm.
10.2307/4040676|Twenty-nine s-triazines were evaluated as subsurface and surface preemergence sprays for the control of crabgrass in corn, grain sorghum, soybean, and cotton and as directed postemergence sprays in cotton. In preemergence experiments corn was tolerant to most chloro-alkylamino-s-triazines but was severely injured by most methoxy- and methylmercapto-alkylamino-s-triazines. 2-Chloro-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine [propazine], 2,4-bis(ethylamino)-6-trichloromethyl-s-triazine, and 2-chloro-4-isopropylamino-6-methylamino-s-triazine were about equally effective for selective preemeregence weed control in grain sorghum. 2,4-Bis(ethylamino)-6-trichloromethyl-s-triazine and perhaps 2-methoxy-4,6-bis [(3-methoxy)propylamino]-s-triazine were sufficiently active and selective to suggest additional evaluation as preemergence herbicides for soybeans. Cotton exhibited tolerance to certain methylmercapto derivatives; 2,4-bis(isopropylamino)-6-methylmercapto-s-triazine [prometryne] as a preemergence and as a directed postemergence spray appeared especially promising for control of weeds in cotton. Generally methoxy- and methyl-mercapto-alkylamino-s-triazines as preemergence and postemergence sprays were more effective for controlling crabgrass than corresponding chloro-alkylamino-s-triazines. The initial and residual toxicities of 14 of the more promising s-triazines were compared in four soils of the southern United States. Initial effective levels of the methoxy and methylmercapto derivatives varied more among soils than those of corresponding chloro derivatives. In most cases methoxy s-triazines were more toxic to the fifth oat crop than corresponding chloro s-triazines whereas chloro s-triazines exhibited the greatest initial toxicities. Certain methylmercapto derivatives appeared fairly persistent also.
10.2307/4040679|The toxic effects of 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) to barley were avoided by feeding plants treated with 1.5 lb/A of simazine, sucrose, glucose, aspartate, and maltose. Shoots from plants fed glucose and maltose contained more soluble carbohydrate than the check. Plants fed glutamine and asparagine were higher in total nitrogen content than the check. Plants fed sucrose and maltose increased their nitrogen content over the check, but plants fed glucose did not. The harmful effects of simazine occurred primarily in barley shoots exposed to light. Plants grown in the dark showed a very small decrease in weight of shoots and soluble carbohydrate content as the level of simazine increased, while the weight of the shoots and soluble carbohydrate content of treated plants grown in the light decreased sharply. Simazine had little effect on root growth of plants grown in the light or dark. The data on root respiration showed that barley roots metabolized the added substances differently and that simazine differentially influenced their metabolism by the roots.
10.2307/4040521|The temperature at which seeds of witchweed (Striga asiatica (L.) Kuntze), an obligate parasite, were stored markedly influenced the length of time that the seeds remained dormant. Dormancy was broken completely by storing seeds collected in August, 1960, at 88 F for 6 weeks, at 75 for 24 weeks, at 40 for 32 weeks and at 0 F for 40 weeks. Seed viability was lost rapidly when the storage of seeds was continued at 88 or 100 F plus 100% relative humidity after seed dormancy had been broken. All of the seeds stored under those conditions were non-viable within 20 weeks after storage began. The viability of seeds stored at 75, 40 or 0 F had not decreased after 26 months for 1960 seeds. Seeds collected in 1961 and stored at those three temperatures or at 88 F plus 20% relative humidity for 14 months did not decrease in per cent viability. A hypothesis on the physiology of the dormancy, viability, and germination of witchweed seeds is presented.
10.2307/4040541|Amine salts of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxypropionic acid (silvex) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) were applied to tall larkspur, Delphinium barbeyi Huth, at 2, 4, and 8 lb/A on three dates. Leaf and stem samples collected 1, 2, and 3 weeks after treatment yielded significantly higher concentrations of alkaloids than did controls. Leaves and stems from plants treated with silvex contained more alkaloids than did those treated with 2,4,5-T. Alkaloid concentration in the leaves varied directly with the rate of herbicide following the first treatment in mid-July, but this relation was not apparent in samples obtained from the third treatment in August.
10.2307/4040544|Weeds in row crops of the Lower Coastal Plain in Alabama were sampled by line transects in both April and August. More than 100,000 feet of transects were assayed, with detailed questioning of producers in the area. The most important weeds of summer and fall and of winter and spring are listed, with per cent coverage and per cent frequency for weeds of row crops.
10.2307/4040524|Disodium endothal (3,6 endoxohexahydrophthalic acid) was applied to a number of emergent and submerged aquatic species and was found to be particularly effective in controlling pondweeds, Potamogeton spp. On P. foliosus, P. crispus, and P. pectinatus, liquid and granular preparations appeared to be equally effective. Endothal was not very effective on some species, such as waterwillow, Justicia americana, and creeping waterprimrose, Jussiaea repens L. var. glabrescens, although defoliation did occur.
10.2307/4040536| The effect of ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (EPTC) on photosynthesis was determined by CO fixation by red kidney bean, Phaseolus vulgaris L., leaves following root application of this herbicide in a time-course study at various concentrations of the herbicide. EPTC inhibited CO fixation at relatively high concentrations and long exposures of the herbicide, but did not alter the relative distribution of C in the various labeled compounds. The effect of EPTC on the respiration of excised embryos of corn and mung bean (Phaseolus aureus Roxb.) following 24 or 48 hr exposures to the herbicide. When the data were expressed on a fresh-weight basis, it indicated that EPTC stimulated respiration, but the same data expressed on an embryo basis did not show this stimulation. EPTC inhibited the growth and the concurrent increase in fresh weight of these embryos. The effect of EPTC on oxidative phosphorylation was determined with cucumber mitochondria. EPTC markedly inhibited both phosphorus uptake and oxygen consumption. Phosphorus esterification was more sentitive than oxygen utilization: this gave a reduced P/O ratio or an uncoupling effect. However, since the concentration of EPTC required to produce these effects was quite high, the physiological significance of the results is questionable. 
10.2307/4040535|The butoxyethanol and propylene glycol butyl esters of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) were applied to and recovered from the leaf surfaces of garden bean and corn plants. Both the acid and the ester of 2,4-D were recovered, indicating that hydrolysis of the esters had occurred. The acid and esters of 2,4-D were also found in both leaves and stems of the bean plants, indicating that further hydrolysis had occurred within the plants. Bean plant homogenates incubated with 2,4-D esters yielded 2,4-D acid. The root exudate from corn plants treated with 2,4-D butoxyethanol ester showed the presence of both acid and ester.
10.2307/4040525|The herbicides n-propyl ethyl-n-butylthiolcarbamate (PEBC), PEBC + 2,3-dichloroallyl diisopropylthiolcarbamate (DATC), PEBC + ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (EPTC), and PEBC + 2,3,3-trichloroallyl diisopropyldithiolcarbamate (CP-22819) among others produced effective control of lambsquarters (Chenopodium album), pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), Setaria spp. and other weed species without undue injury to sugar beet seedlings. PEBC + DATC also gave control of wild oat (Avena fatua), and increased the control of lambsquarters; however, this latter effect was inversely related to the control of other broad-leaved weeds. Control equal to PEBC was produced by PEBC + EPTC with 2.5 lb. less total active ingredient per acre. The herbicide 3,6-endoxohexahydrophthalic acid (endothal) gave inferior control of weeds. None of the herbicides tested effectively controlled kochia (Kochia scoparia).
10.2307/4040531|Greenhouse evaluation of 30 s-triazine compounds indicated that several of them were suitable for preemergence weed control in Lee soybeans. The s-triazines least toxic to soybeans generally contained either methoxy or methylmercapto substituents but most of these were highly toxic to crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop.). Soybeans were more tolerant to ethylamino substituted s-triazines than to isopropylamino derivatives. Chloro derivatives were generally toxic to soybeans. Proplyamino, allylamino, methoxypropylamino, ethoxy, trichloromethyl, and amido substitutions had much less effect on soybean selectivity than those previously mentioned. Field evaluation of several s-triazines, preemergence, confirmed the tolerance of soybeans to 2,4-bis(isopropylamino)-6-methylmercapto-s-triazine (prometryne), 2-ethylamino-4-isopropylamino-6-methylmercapto-s-triazine (ametryne), and 2-isopropylamino-4-methylamino-6-methylmercapto-s-triazine (norametryne) at rates that provided adequate weed control.
10.2307/4040527|Inclusion of any one of several ethoxylated nonionic surfactants in aqueous spray mixtures of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron) greatly increased its toxicity to crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop.). Phytotoxicity of sprays made up from commercially formulated diuron was greater than when technical diuron was used. The toxicity of diuron was also increased by the addition of any of several low-molecular-weight alcohols to the spray mixture. The turbidity of diuron suspensions was greatly decreased by addition of any of several nonionic, anionic, or cationic surfactants which contained a fatty acid or fatty acid derivative as the hydrophobic portion of the molecule. Phytotoxicity of diuron applied with ethoxylated nonylphenol surfactants was associated with ethylene oxide (hydrophil) content. Surfactants containing nonylphenol, alkylthiol, or tridecylphenol as hydrophobes appeared essentially equal in their abilities to increase diuron toxicity, but dodecylphenol surfactants were slightly less effective.
10.2307/4040538|Herbicide performance was markedly altered by soil incorporation, depth of incorporation, crop seed placement, soil type, and rainfall. Of the 25 herbicides studied, 2-chloro-N,N-diallylacetamide (CDAA) and isopropyl-N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamate (CIPC) and mixtures of them showed most promise. Herbicide-placement studies showed that the selectivity of these herbicides in cotton largely depends on herbicide placement in relation to the crop seed and on rainfall. Without rainfall, CDAA incorporated in moist soil above the cotton seed provided excellent weed control with minimal injury to cotton. CDAA was readily leached from the zone of germinating weed seed by rain or irrigation on coarse-textured soils. Without rainfall, CIPC was slightly inferior to CDAA in weed control but more stable in performance over a wider range of environmental conditions. Mixtures of CDAA and CIPC were somewhat superior to either alone. Commercial usage of these herbicides in moist soil depends on the development of suitable equipment for application.
10.2307/4040529|3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole) sprayed on annual grassland infested with medusahead (Elymus caput-medusae L.) at 1/2 to 4 lb/A when medusahead was in the boot or soft dough stage reduced viable caryopses from 60 to 100 percent, and seed production the following year from 75 to almost 100 percent. 1,2-Dihydropyridazine-3-6-dione (maleic hydrazide) and 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon) reduced viability of medusahead seeds, but were less effective than amitrole. Viable caryopses of soft chess (Bromus mollis L.) were reduced and the year following treatment soft chess was decreased in the stands by early application (boot stage of medusahead) but not by late application of herbicides, when the soft chess heads were dry.
10.2307/4040526|2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine), ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (EPTC), and 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) were shown to aid in the establishment of rose clover (Trifolium hirtum All.) and hardinggrass (Phalaris tuberosa L. var. stenoptera (Hack.) Hitch.) by reducing competition from resident annual plants, primarily medusahead (Elymus caput-medusae L.). The success of preemergence herbicides was shown to depend on fall precipitation in amounts great enough to permit seed germination and plant growth before winter temperatures become limiting. The degree of weed control necessary to aid in seedling establishment was low, sometimes lower than could be measured by estimates of ground cover.
10.2307/4040543|During 1962, barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crusgalli (L.) Beauv.) seedlings were infested by the larvae of Hyperodes humilis Gyll. The larvae attacked the growing points and the youngest tissues in the crown as well as meristematic tissues of intercalary growth. These infestations produced considerable decreases of barnyardgrass growth and yields, suggesting the possibility of effective biological control of barnyardgrass.
10.2307/4040537|The apparent solubility in water of 2-ethylamino-4-isopropylamino-6-methylmercapto-s-triazine [ametryne], 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl urea [diuron], and 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine [atrazine] was increased when a surfactant was added to the water. At 0.5% surfactant concentrations, considerable variation in solubility was found, both as regards the herbicide and surfactant used, as measured by ultraviolet absorption spectrophotometry. The two triazines were more soluble in cationic surfactants, followed by anionic and nonionic; diuron was more soluble in cationic followed by nonionic and anionic types. Minimum lethal levels of surfactant in water for 2 week old cucumber plants varied from about 0.1% for the cationic to 0.2% for most nonionic and 1.0% or more for anionics of the alkyl aryl sulfonate type.
10.2307/4040530|Preplanting, soil-incorporated treatments of fenac (2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid sodium salt) at 1, 2, 4, and 8 lb/A, 2,3,6-TBA (2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid dimethylamine salt) at 8. 12, and 16 lb/A, and 2,4-D 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid amine salt) at 12 lb/A applied in 1960 to six soil types infested with witchweed (Striga asiatica (L.) Kuntze) resulted in some control of witchweed as measured by visual observations and corn yield. Two or three additional postemergence applications of 2,4-D at 1 lb/A were required to prevent witchweed seed production for the growing season. Witchweed parasitism on corn was greatly reduced by a preplanting treatment of fenac at 2 lb/A plus 2,4-D as a postemergence treatment. All rates of 2,3,6-TBA and fenac at 8 lb/A caused moderate to severe corn injury with the most severe injury occurring on soils with relatively high clay content in the subsoil. Soil residual studies and field observations indicated fenac and 2,3,6-TBA may be present in Coastal Plain soils for more than 18 months.
10.2307/4040539|In tests conducted from 1951 to 1961 in the Peace River section of Alberta, 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron) was applied to vigorous quackgrass (Agropyron repens (L.) Beauv.) sods on different soils. These tests showed: 1) tillage either before or after application of monuron strongly reduced its effect; 2) when used without tillage it did not matter whether monuron was applied in the early summer or early autumn, but when used with tillage it was best applied in the early summer; 3) 40 lb/A applied without tillage eradicated quackgrass under all conditions except when it was established in an unusually deep and loamy soil; 4) killing quackgrass by monuron usually took 2 years; and 5) lethal rates of monuron prevented quackgrass re-establishment for from 1 to 7 years and satisfactory growth of cereal crops for 10 years or more.
10.2307/4040532| The effect of fully-saturated bicyclic and partially-saturated tricyclic dimethylureas and dimethylthioureas on the photolytic activity (Hill reaction) of chloroplasts isolated from turnip greens (Brassica spp.) was studied. Photochemical activity was measured potentiometrically with ferricyanide as the electron acceptor. Chemicals tested were 3-[5-(3a,4,5,6,7a-hexahydro-4,7-methanoindenyl)]1,1-dimethylurea; 3-(chloro-2-norbornyl)-1,1-dimethylurea; 1,1-dimethyl-3-(2-norbornyl)urea; and the 3 corresponding thioureas. Concentrations of the 3 polycyclic ureas required to inhibit the Hill reaction by 50 percent (I) were respectively 4.0  10 M, 1.2  10 M, and 6.6  10 M. The thioureas were not very inhibitory to the Hill reaction; consequently, their I values were not determined. The fully or partially-saturated polycyclic dimethylureas were weaker inhibitors of the Hill reaction than the phenyldimethylureas. The decreased inhibitory activity of the polycyclic ureas was attributed to increased lipophilic properties, unfavorable spatial configurations, and lack of resonance interaction between the ring system and the imino nitrogen. 
10.2307/4040523|Atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine) applied in nutrient solution to corn, cotton, and soybeans reduced transpiration both in intact plants and excised shoots. This effect occurred only in the light. Microscopic examination revealed that atrazine caused closure of the stomates. Atrazine treated plants had higher moisture levels than the checks 12-24 hours after treatment, but later percentages were lower than the checks.
10.2307/4040533|Long-term compensation points in waterstargrass (Heteranthera dubia (Jacq.) Mac M), coontail (Ceratophyllum demersum L.), and duckweed (Lemna minor L.) were near 2-3% full sunlight during a 28-day period. Fresh weight of H. dubia increased as temperature increased from 15 to 30 C and as light intensity increased from 110 to 1000 foot-candles. Fresh weight of C. demersum increased as temperature increased above 20 C and as light intensity increased from 120 to 550 foot-candles. The L. minor strain used in this experiment was not temperature-dependent and increased in fresh weight and frond number at 25 and 30 C as light intensity increased from 77 to 550 foot-candles.
10.2307/4040534| Orchardgrass (Dactylic glomerata L.) and Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) were used as test species to study the phytotoxicity of mixtures of 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon) and dimethylarsinic acid (cacodylic acid). A technique involving ED values, a shortened graphic procedure, and probit transformations was developed. Mixtures in which cacodylic acid was in excess indicated synergistic effects on bluegrass and additive effects on orchardgrass. Dalapon in excess in the mixtures appeared to have had an antagonistic effect on cacodylic acid. Orchardgrass was more tolerant to cacodylic acid than bluegrass. 
10.2307/4040528|Peach trees treated with the herbicide mixture of 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole plus ammonium thiocyanate (amitrole-T) had higher leaf nitrogen and more growth than trees where the weeds were controlled by hand hoeing or a black plastic mulch. Apple trees had higher leaf nitrogen and more growth when treated with simazine and amitrole-T than with no weed control. In both peaches and apples more growth and higher leaf nitrogen resulted from the herbicide treatments than from supplemental nitrogen treatments, indicating that the herbicide influenced the nitrogen metabolism of these trees.
10.2307/4040540|During the vegetative phase of barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crusgalli (L.) Beauv.) development, the leaves, axillary buds (tillers) and permanent root system were initiated and developed. First adventitious roots appeared on the 6th day after germination. Internode elongation, which was coincident with a change from a vegetative phase to a reproductive phase of the plant, was observed in the field about 30 days after germination. At this time the main stem had 4-5 maturing leaves. Typically, barnyardgrass formed 8 leaves on the main axis from primordia which were initiated during the first two weeks after germination. The first tiller primordium appeared in the axil of either the 1st or 2nd leaf on the day of emergence from the soil. In the field, tillering was observed from the twelfth day. Heading began on the 40th day and the first mature seeds were formed about 64 days after germination.
10.2307/4040522|The response of purple nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus L.) clones grown from single tubers to 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole), butoxyethanol ester of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (EPTC), and the response of established nutsedge to amitrole were studied under field conditions of the Georgia Piedmont Plateau. Clones were essentially eradicated by two applications of amitrole initiated up to 4 weeks after shoot emergence and by EPTC incorporated at 1 or 2 weeks after emergence. Excellent control resulted from 9 applications of 2,4-D initiated 1 or 2 weeks after shoot emergence. Timely applications of amitrole to an established stand controlled but did not eradicate nutsedege. This decreased response in an established stand seemed due, in part, to irregular emergence of plants in the established stand.
10.2307/4040702|The observation that riboflavin overcomes the chlorosis response of higher plants to amitrole was confirmed. Amitrole was shown to be decomposed in the presence of riboflavin and light. It is suggested that this decomposition proceeds by a free radical mechanism, either in the culture medium or in the plant.
10.2307/4040700| Chain- and ring-labeled 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) were supplied to corn by way of the nutrient solution. Autoradiographs of the paper chromatograms revealed that two identical C-labeled metabolites were present in the extracts whether the plants were supplied with ring- or chain-labeled simazine. Corn, cotton, and soybeans all yielded appreciable amounts of CO when grown in solutions containing chain-labeled simazine. One lb/A 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) (preemergence) caused a reduction in respiration as well as the activity of catalase, peroxidase, phenol oxidase, ascorbic acid oxidase, and glycolic acid oxidase in oats, soybeans, beans, cotton, peanuts, Johnsongrass, and corn, 7 and 11 days after treatment. Attempts to correlate enzyme activity with sensitivity to atrazine were unsuccessful, except that increasing phenol oxidase activity appeared to be roughly correlated with increasing resistance. 
10.2307/4040697|An accurate method of determining loss of 2-chloro-N, N-diallylacetamide (CDAA) from soil surfaces was developed. It was found that under some circumstances the volatility response to temperature was reversed to give a decreasing loss with increasing temperature. The volatility-temperature relationship was found to be strongly influenced by the amount of water present on the soil colloid, with increasing amounts of water accelerating CDAA volatility loss. The mechanism for this reaction appears to involve competition between water and CDAA for adsorption sites; however, this factor cannot be differentiated from removal of CDAA from the soil by simple solubilization in water with subsequent steam distillation. A direct correlation between organic matter content of the soil and resistance of CDAA to evaporation from that soil was shown.
10.2307/4040708|Development was followed in Connecticut and Maryland. Germination of yellow foxtail (Setaria lutescens (Weigel) F. T. Hubb. occurred over a long time period. Tillering of the developing plants was affected by spacing between plants and location. The average number of tillers in Maryland was 75 for plants spaced 12 in. apart and 26 for plants spaced 2 in. apart. In the greenhouse under short day conditions seed heads were readily produced. Under continuous light no seed heads formed. Giant foxtail (S. Faberii Herrm.) followed a similar growth pattern but the plants were larger and formed fewer tillers. Growth of both species was severely affected by shading. Both species rooted from cuttings.
10.2307/4040711|Ten herbicides were applied preemergence to proso millet (Panicum miliaceum), three Amaranthus species, and Chenopodium album L. The herbicides were either incorporated or left on the soil surface and plots were either sprinkler or furrow irrigated. The phytotoxicity of some herbicides was increased by soil incorporation and/or sprinkler irrigation. Some were unaffected by method of irrigation, and others were not affected by incorporation. Grass and broadleaf weed control were affected differently by incorporation and irrigation. When incorporated with furrow irrigation, five herbicides developed weed control patterns indicating a movement similar to salt movement. A more complex pattern occurred with non-incorporated herbicides.
10.2307/4040699|Early-spring, broadcast, disked-in applications of nitrogen fertilizers caused an increased germination of wild oat (Avena fatua L.) seed present in the soil. With adequate moisture, there was increased wild oat infestation in the seeded crop from early-spring application, whereas with dry weather the effects did not carry over into the crop period. The apparent breaking of seed dormancy by nitrates from fertilizer applications may offer another method for combating wild oats other than by herbicides. Fertilizer treatment might be used to deplete seed reserves in the fallow years and to reduce the amount of seed returned to the soil in the crop years by combining a fertilizer treatment with delayed crop seeding.
10.2307/4040710|The injurious effects of different rates of fenuron (3-peynyl-1,1-dimethylurea) on four species of brush were recorded for two years in two different types of southwestern brushlands, the Oak-chaparral and the Chihuahuan Desert Shrub. Fenuron was more injurious to fire sprouts than to mature plants of turbinella oak (Quercus turbinella Greene) in the Oak- chaparral type especially at 2 to 8 lb/A ai. The effects of fenuron on mature plants were reduced by burning, suggesting that much of the fenuron absorbed was residual in the stems, twigs, and leaves where it was destroyed by the fire. The effect of fenuron on the fire sprouts changed only slightly between six months and two years. Gibberellic acid was applied to sprouts and mature oak plants appeared to slightly reduce the injurious effects of some rates of fenuron during the first six months but no gibberellin induced differences were observed after two years. In the Chihuahuan Desert shrub type, tarbush (Flourencia cernua DC.) and whitethorn (Acacia constricta Benth.) were about equally susceptible to injury by fenuron with creosotebush (Larrea tridentata (DC.) Cov.) slightly more resistant. Summer applications just before the rainy season were most effective and 4 lb/A combined high shrub kill with greatest grass growth. Although 8 and 16 lb/A ai killed and injured both grasses and shrubs on the oak plots, grass naturally reseeded into these plots within six months after treatment, but on the Chihuahuan Desert area grass had not recovered on the plots treated at 8 lb/A after two years. This difference in grass re-establishment was probably due to rainfall differences which would give differences in leaching of fenuron. Palatability of the grasses in the oak plots increased due to fenuron treatments, particularly on the heavily treated plots. These studies indicate that moderate rates of fenuron, applied just prior to favorable seasonal rains and repeated at several-year intervals, may be used to control turbinella oak sprouts and mature Chihuahuan Desert shrubs. However, treatments would only be economical where high forage and watershed values would result.
10.2307/4040703|This paper extends previous observations on the interaction of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole) and riboflavin leading to the decomposition of amitrole to include the protective effect of amitrole on the photodestruction of flavins and flavoproteins. Photoactivation of radioactive amitrole in the presence of riboflavin causes the labeling of inert protein. Cupric ion, ascorbic acid, and oxygen can replace riboflavin and light in the destruction of amitrole and in the labeling of inert protein. The inhibition of fatty acid peroxidase previously reported by Castelfranco has been shown to be irreversible and to require the presence of a hydrogen peroxide generating system. The authors suggest a hypothesis for the mode of action of amitrole which depends upon the ability of this compound to interact with free radical generating systems, presumably by undergoing a one-electron oxidation.
10.2307/4040695|Addition of surfactant (a polyoxyethylene thioether) to solutions of sodium 2,2-dichloropropionate (dalapon) increased the activity of both technical and formulated grades of dalapon on Johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers.). The increase in activity was influenced by the rate and formulation of herbicide and in some instances by the volume of water in which treatments were applied. Varying the volume of diluent affected control with technical dalapon to a greater extent than that with formulated dalapon probably because of differences in surfactant concentrations. Plants arising from short rhizomes were more readily controlled by dalapon than those from longer rhizomes.
10.2307/4040694|Four forage grasses and five forage legumes were grown in greenhouse cultures containing 0.12, 0.25, 0.50, and 1.0 ppm of atrazine and of simazine in the soil. They were also planted April 2 and 9 in field plots which had been treated the previous spring with 0, 1, 2, and 4 lb/A of the same herbicides. In the greenhouse, atrazine produced more injury to the plants than simazine. In the field, residual simazine produced more marked injury. Tall fescue and alfalfa were the most tolerant crops. Timothy was the most susceptible. Red clover, Korean lespedeza, ladino clover, sweet-clover, orchardgrass, and bromegrass were intermediate.
10.2307/4040707|Of the grasses studied over a 3-year period, Alta tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) was most competitive and Troy bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) least competitive with Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense). Ladino white clover was more competitive than birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus) when present in full stands. Winter-killing of Ladino clover (Trifolium repens L.) resulted in an increase in Canada thistle, particularly at low irrigation levels. Irrigation favored an increase in Canada thistle numbers in the year the grass stands were established. In the next two years thistle numbers declined more rapidly on irrigated than on non-irrigated plots. High rates of nitrogen increased the competitive ability of the grasses.
10.2307/4040704|Ninety-one herbicides and experimental compounds were evaluated for herbicidal activity on submersed aquatic weeds, Potamogeton pectinatus L. and P. nodosus Poir. Twenty-one of the compounds tested showed some phytotoxicity at 20 lb/A. The other compounds were completely inactive. 2,3,6-Trichlorophenylacetic acid (fenac) and 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile (dichlobenil), showed outstanding activity with good persistence in water-saturated soil. Fenac and 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid (silvex), were tested in field trials in an irrigation canal in eastern Wyoming. The sodium salt and amide of fenac did not give adequate weed control at 5 lb/A. Spring applications of herbicides did not perform as well as fall ones. Mechanical incorporation of herbicides improved some results, but was of doubtful value.
10.2307/4040698|Band applications of the best residual preemergence herbicides were equal to timely shallow cultivations for weed control in soybeans, and were superior when wet weather delayed the early shallow cultivations. The ten-year average soybean yield reduction of 3.8 bushels per acre from weed competition despite normal control methods suggests that, under normal conditions, the net cost of herbicide treatment would not exceed the value of the soybeans lost through failure to control weeds. Coarse broad-leaved annuals were a minor part of the weed populations and there was no giant foxtail, so the benefits of herbicides would probably be greater with these weeds present.
10.2307/4040701|Stands of leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.) were reduced over 90 per cent by 20 combinations of crops, cultivation, and herbicides. Three of the best crop rotations in two 4-year trials were: (1) a short season of intensive cultivation, a mid-August seeding of alfalfa, a crop of alfalfa, spring wheat sprayed with 1/2 lb/A of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) (an ester formulation was always used) three postharvest cultivations, corn sprayed with 1/3 lb/A 2,4-D; (2) a short season of intensive cultivation, a mid-August seeding of bromegrass sprayed with 1 lb/A 2,4-D in early June and mid-August during the second and third years, and a crop of corn the fourth year; (3) spring oats sprayed with 1/3 lb of 2,4-D ester and three postharvest cultivations, three spring cultivations a close-drilled crop of sudangrass and fall cultivation, spring wheat sprayed with 1/2 lb/A of 2,4-D ester and three fall cultivations, a crop of corn sprayed. The best use of non-selective herbicides in four 2-year trials was spring application of 4 to 6 lb/A of 2,3,6-(trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA), plow 10 days later, followed by a corn crop and a spring oats crop, both treated with 2,4-D and 4 to 6 lb/A of 2,3,6-TBA applied after oats harvest, and the field plowed 10 days later. Reinfestation by seedlings was prevented by an annual spring application of 1/3 to 1/2 lb/A of 2,4-D per acre.
10.2307/4040696|Triazines were applied to 1-0 stock (1-year-old, not transplanted) on sandy soils at 1/2, 1, and 2 lb/A and to 2-0 stock at 1, 2, and 4 lb/A. Simetone (2-methoxy-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine) had no apparent effects on weeds or seedlings. All rates of 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) and the higher rates of 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) and 2-chloro-4-isopropylamino-6-methylamino-s-triazine (G-30026) controlled weeds but seriously injured 1-0 stock. All rates of 2-chloro-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (propazine) controlled weeds without injuring seedlings. Atrazine and G-30026 at 4 lb/A injured 2-0 stock. Simazine at 2 and 4 lb/A and atrazine at 1 and 2 lb/A did not affect 2-1 transplants. CDAA (2-chloro-N,N-diallylacetamide) and CDEC (2-chloroallyl diethyldithiocarbamate) at 4 and 8 lb/A did not affect weeds or 1-0 and 2-0 stock. At 16 and 32 lb/A, CDAA was highly toxic to weeds and stock, while CDEC controlled weeds with only a temporary effect on seedlings at 32 lb/A. CDAA and CDEC at 4 and 8 lb/A did not affect weeds or 2-1 transplants. N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) and sodium 2,4-dichlorophenoxyethyl sulfate (sesone) at 1.8 and 3.6 lb/A did not control weeds. Sesone injured 1-0 and 2-0, but not 2-1 red pine. Ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (EPTC) at 3 and 6 lb/A controlled weeds without injuring 1-0, 2-0, or 2-1 red pine. These experiments emphasized that many herbicides too toxic for nursery use may be useful in site preparation for planting or in plantation release.
10.2307/4040709|2-Methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) is widely used to control broad-leaved weeds in pea fields. Occasionally, peas are severely injured by MCPA. This study was conducted in 1959 and 1960 to determine the relationships, if any, of environmental factors and of chemical constituents of plants at the time of spraying to the tolerance of peas to MCPA. Plants were equally susceptible to MCPA at either the 5- or 10-node stages. The time of day at which plants were sprayed appeared to be the most important factor associated with the tolerance of pea to MCPA. Fresh weights of vines and yields of shelled peas from plants sprayed at noon and 4:00 pm were significantly lower than those from unsprayed plants or plants sprayed at other times of the day. The carbohydrate content of pea plants varied with the time of day (exposure to light). The carbohydrate content was associated with susceptibility to injury by MCPA. A high carbohydrate content at the time of spraying was associated with a high degree of susceptibility to MCPA. High temperature at the time of spraying tended to increase the rate of translocation of MCPA. However, in the absence of prolonged exposure to light prior to treatment, high temperature alone did not predispose peas to injury by MCPA.
10.2307/4040712|Three-quarter inch seedlings of northern nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus L.) were transplanted into the field where numbers of plants, inflorescences and the rate of spread were recorded. Seed was collected from each plot and germination tests conducted. During one growing season, a single seedling developed into a stand of plants that produced a yield of 90,000 seeds with a germination of 51%.
10.2307/4040705|Rates of evaporation of dalapon acid and four low-volatile esters of dalapon from open dishes at 38C. in pounds per acre per hour, determined gravimetrically, were dalapon acid, 180; propyleneglycol bis ester, 27; diethyleneglycol bis ester, 1.6; dipropyleneglycol bis ester, 0.83; and triethyleneglycol bis ester, 0.61. Foliar applications on an acid equivalent basis were phytotoxic to seedling oats in the increasing order of propyleneglycol bis ester, acid, dipropyleneglycol bis ester, diethyleneglycol bis ester, sodium salt, and tripropyleneglycol bis ester. Relative phytotoxicities were not altered by subjecting plants to rapid drying after spraying. These compounds did not differ significantly in phytotoxicity when added to the rooting medium of germinating oat plants. The triethyleneglycol bis ester, and possibly other esters of dalapon, may offer practical advantages as herbicides other than those related to volatility.
10.2307/4040706| Foliar absorption of 2,4-D-C was rapid in both species. Cotton decarboxylated the side chain of 2,4-D several times faster than sorghum. Both species released CO faster from the carboxyl than from the methylene position. Cotton slowly converted 2,4-D to a chromatographically different material in young leaves and bolls. Sorghum rapidly converted 2,4-D to a product different from 2,4-D and the 2,4-D-complex in cotton. After cotton recovered from 2,4-D-treatment, the regulator could not be detected in subsequent vegetative or reproductive growth. 
10.2307/4040573|In a "closed system" nutrient solution experiment, shoot growth of downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.) was: (1) more rapid during early growth, (2) accelerated earlier by nitrogen, and (3) increased more by low to intermediate levels of nitrogen than that of crested wheatgrass (Agropyron desertorum Fisch. ex Link). Shoot growth of crested wheatgrass was increased more by high levels of nitrogen and at a more mature stage of growth than that of downy brome. Root growth of crested wheatgrass was greater at all nitrogen levels than that of downy brome and was increased by the high nitrogen levels. Downy brome removed more nitrogen from solution at the intermediate nitrogen level than did crested wheatgrass and more phosphorus at both the low and intermediate nitrogen levels. At the highest nitrogen level, crested wheatgrass removed more nitrogen from solution than did downy brome.
10.2307/4040589|Rhizome sections of ironweed from which the fleshy roots had been pruned made less than half as much growth in the greenhouse as sections which had three inches of fleshy roots attached. Rhizome sections at least two inches long with portions of the fleshy roots intact should be used for asexual reproduction of ironweed. Ironweed plants in the field after 8 and 9 years of mowing treatments at 2 dates were approximately 2/3 as tall as untreated plants. No significant reduction in stand was obtained by 9 successive years of mowing.
10.2307/4040580|Rose clover (Trifolium hirtum All.), subterranean clover (T. subterraneum L.), and crimson clover (T. incarnatum L.), were sprayed at different growth stages with 2,2-dichloropropionic acid dalapon), and two formulations of 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-butyric acid [4-(2,4-DB)], in two growing seasons. Herbage yields, seed yields, and seed quality were for the most part unaffected by either formulation of 4-(2,4-DB) at the dates required for weed control. Only subterranean clover was tolerant of dalapon and then only at very low rates.
10.2307/4040593|A quick-coupling sprayer tank, a pressure introduction and release valve, and a device for measuring the time elapsed during a spraying run are described.
10.2307/4040588|Application of 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) generally reduced dry weight of tops and roots of corn and Pinus radiata seedlings. Simazine always increased top-root ratios of corn but generally decreased those of pine seedlings. Simazine increased significantly the uptake of N by corn in all soils; of Mg and P in limed, and of K in acidified soils. Aluminum sulfate decreased injury from simazine. Lime at 3 tons per acre mixed into the soil exerted a synergistic effect on the activity of 12 pounds per acre of simazine and killed all pine seedlings in the 7th or 8th week after sowing. The death of the seedlings was caused by excess calcium ions and not by pH.
10.2307/4040572| Amitrole-5-C was rapidly degraded in unsterile soil but underwent only minor modification in sterile soil. An unidentified chemical product of amitrole was formed in both sterile and unsterile soil. The principle metabolic product of amitrole was carbon dioxide; however, at least 13 additional compounds were formed. One or more metabolic compounds formed from amitrole are tenaciously bound to the soil and appear to be resistant to degradation. 
10.2307/4040586| C-ring-labeled 2-chloro-4-diethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (ipazine) was soil-applied to young cotton plants or placed in solution cultures. C-labeled constituents accumulated in the lysigenous glands of roots, stems, and leaves. Retranslocation of C-labeled components into new growth after removal of C-ipazine from solution cultures did not occur. No evolution of of CO by C-ipazine-treated plants was detected, but evolution of CO occurred from C-ipazine-treated soil. Some unaltered C-ipazine was present in leaves and stems sampled 3 months after treatment. No C-ipazine could be detected in seed formed on treated plants. Free hydroxyipazine did not constitute a major degradation product. However, hydroxyipazine and other basic substances appeared to be released upon hydrolysis of a chloroform-soluble, non-distillable component that accumulated in roots and leaves. An ethanol-insoluble, non-dialyzable component also accumulated in leaves and roots. 
10.2307/4040579|Unshielded cultivation (during which soil is purposely moved into the drill row) and shielded cultivation (soil movement into drill row minimized) were compared in field plots of cotton [Gossypium hirsutum L. (var. DBES 8274)] which received no herbicide, a banded preemergence herbicide, one to three banded postemergence herbicide applications, or a combination of the banded pre- and postemergence herbicides. All plots were hoed and cultivated as needed to maintain reasonably good control of weeds. The study was a 3-year experiment replicated six times. Unshielded cultivation was superior or equal to shielded cultivation as a weed control measure supplementary to hoeing or hoeing and herbicides as evaluated by effects on hoe-labor requirements, cotton yields, and weed infestations at harvest time. Replacing one or more postemergence herbicide applications with unshielded cultivation resulted in reduced control of weeds. Late season initiation of unshielded cultivation in plots previously shield cultivated had no detrimental effect on yield. Significant increases in yield of cotton were obtained in plots treated with a preemergence herbicide as compared with plots receiving only hoeing and cultivation for weed control. Postemergence herbicide treatments (applied as a directed spray) did not result in significantly higher yields as compared with plots receiving hoeing and cultivation only. As measured by 3-year averages preemergence or postemergence treatments provided about 50 per cent control of weeds; combined they provided about 75 per cent control.
10.2307/4040577|Barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crusgalli (L.) Beauv.) seeds which did not germinate because of low temperature, insufficient moisture, or seed dormancy were exposed to concentrations of ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (EPTC) lethal to emerging barnyardgrass seedlings. After different periods of exposure, seeds were removed from the EPTC-treated environments and germinated in untreated soil. Seed germination was not reduced by EPTC and there was no permanent injury to the seedlings. It was concluded that rates of EPTC used for selective weed control do not injure barnyardgrass seeds prior to germination.
10.2307/4040581|The addition of a combination of methyl cellulose, sodium acetate and an alkyl aryl sodium sulfonate (sodium petroleum sulfonate) to spray solutions increased the toxicity of 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon) to oats and Cynodon dactylon L. The most effective combination tested on oats in the laboratory was 2.25% methyl cellulose, 1.75% sodium acetate, and 0.8% of an alkyl aryl sodium sulfonate. Lower concentrations of the three materials, combinations of any two of these additives, or any one added alone were less effective. Under field conditions, the response of Cynodon dactylon L. to dalapon was more rapid, control was more uniform and regrowth slower when dalapon sprays contained the three additives. Methyl cellulose increased and maintained the spray load on the grass foliage. Alkyl aryl sodium sulfonate probably increased penetration of dalapon. Sodium acetate increased the toxicity of the spray.
10.2307/4040574|A laboratory sprayer for precision application of herbicides to pot cultures consists of a miniature compressed-air sprayer mounted as a pendulum and equipped to automatically spray a pot placed beneath the center of its arc of swing.
10.2307/4040584|Dalapon (2,2-dichloropropionic acid) was applied to a predominantly medusahead (Elymus caput-medusae L.) community at rates of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 lb/A and at four stages of growth. Low rates of dalapon gave better control when applied at early growth stages than the same rates applied later. Reduction in total ground cover was less from December and February applications than from March applications. Dalapon at 3 lb/A applied 30 days after emergence gave 100% kill of medusahead. Two lb/A gave 96% or better control when applied during the vegetative stage (December, February, March). Both 2 and 3 lb/A applied in December, and 2 lb/A in February left a favorable balance of species among the remaining forage plants.
10.2307/4040591|Vegetative propagules of sago pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus L.) and American pondweed (P. nodosus Poir.) grown under a 14-hr photoperiod of light varying in chromatic composition produced plants with longer internodes and more extensive shoot and stolon development under red light than under blue. Pondweeds grown for 4 weeks under 25 to 400 ft-c of light made progressively more growth at the higher light intensities. Plant weight, branch number and stolon development increased while shoot length and shoot-root decreased with increased light. Pondweeds grown under each of 5 light intensities at temperatures of 60, 70, or 80 F were treated with emulsified xylene or alkyl tolyl methyl trimethyl ammonium chloride. Pondweeds cultured at the higher light intensities and higher temperatures were progressively more injured. Injury from treatment with either herbicide increased with age and plant maturity from early vegetative to flower-bud stage. Equivalent injury was produced on plants of equivalent maturity regardless of chronological age. Pondweeds cultured under 400 ft-c of light and a 14-hr photoperiod required approximately 900 degree-days over a 49 F threshold to reach flower-bud stage.
10.2307/4040576|Amitrole (3-amino-1,2,4-triazole) was applied to purple nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus L.) clones newly established in the field in the Piedmont Plateau. Applications were made one week after initial foliar emergence, then at biweekly intervals through the 20th week. The principal results were: (1) Nutsedge was most susceptible to amitrole applied 4 weeks after initial emergence. The next most susceptible stages were at 1 or 2 weeks; (2) Six weeks after emergence, nutsedge appeared resistant to amitrole; (3) All applications after 10 weeks were relatively ineffective; (4) Chemical analyses of tubers and bulbs indicated a high ash content early in the season, particularly at 6 weeks after emergence.
10.2307/4040587| The absorption and translocation of labeled herbicides by submersed weeds was studied by sealing the immersed root system in a 60 ml polyethylene bottle and immersing the bottle and shoots in water in a 500 ml graduate. The medium for either roots or tops could be treated without affecting the other. Simazine [2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino-1-C)-s-triazine] and fenac [2, 3, 6-trichlorophenylacetic acid-1-C (mixed isomers)] were absorbed by both roots and shoots of waterstargrass (Heteranthera dubia) and translocated to the untreated portion (root or shoot) of the plant. The distribution patterns of C-labeled simazine and fenac in bluegills (Lepomis macrohirus) were studied by gross autoradiography. The viscera of the fish contained the greatest amount of activity. 
10.2307/4040582|Application of 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) was effective in controlling quackgrass (Agropyron repens) in fields planted to corn. Corn yields were greatly improved by the treatment. Most favorable dates of application were in the fall or in the early spring before planting. Applications after corn planting were much less effective. Favorable rates of application were 2 to 4 lb/A. Rates lower than 2 lb/A were not as effective and rates over 8 lb/A were not required. Atrazine and 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) were generally superior to other triazine analogues used. Greater solubility and greater activity as a foliar spray favors use of atrazine for control of quackgrass.
10.2307/4040590| The disodium salt of 3,6-endoxohexahydrophthalic acid (disodium endothal) and the derivative identified by the manufacturer as the di-N,N-dimethylococoamine salt of endothal (coded as TD-47) were particularly effective upon submersed species of aquatic vegetation as contact herbicides. Disodium endothal at concentrations of 0.5 to 10.0 ppmw was effective in controlling approximately 50 per cent of the 19 species of plants involved in 270 tests. TD-47 at concentrations of 0.02 to 10.0 ppmw trolled 77 per cent of the 11 plant species in 94 tests. Algae (Chara, Cladophora, Pithophora, and Spirogyra) were more effectively controlled by TD-47 than by disodium endothal. Although TD-47 was at least 10 times more herbicidal than disodium endothal, it was about 100 times more toxic to fish. Disodium endothal was more than 50 per cent effective on submersed aquatic plants at rates in excess of 2.5 ppmw with a wide margin of safety in fish (4- to 10-fold). Disodium endothal had a median tolerance limit ranging from 95 to 150 ppmw in the aggregate of nine fish species tested extensively. Median tolerance limits for TD-47 ranged from about 0.06 to 0.3 ppmw for five species of fish. TD-47 applied at a concentration lethal to fish (0.3 to 1.0 ppmw) was effective as a dual management tool in controlling vegetation and achieving partial or complete renovation of stunted fish populations. Young, growing vegetation was most susceptible to control, and best results were achieved at water temperatures exceeding 60 F. Higher rates were required to kill plants as they matured and stands became dense. Endothal liquid formulations were superior to granules in controlling algal mats, floating and emergent plants. Granules were more effective on submersed rooted plants. TD-47 residues were of short duration. The rate of disappearance depended on time and concentration. Detectable residues disappeared within 8 days following application of 0.3 ppmw and within 2 weeks for 0.6 ppmw. However, 1.0 to 3.0 ppmw took up to 25 days to disappear. Some residues were found in fish-food organisms from treated enclosures 3 weeks after application. Fish flesh showed no absorption of endothal-armeens at sublethal concentrations. Intraperitoneal injection of endothal into fish produced a disturbance of the osmoregulation. The physiological effect of endothal was measured by chemical analysis of blood serum. 
10.2307/4040592|Stands of Russian knapweed (Centaurea repens L.) were reduced over 80 per cent by several combinations of crops, cultivation and herbicides. Two of the best crop rotations in a 4-year trial were: (1) a short season of intensive cultivation and a mid-August seeding of bromegrass that was sprayed with 1 lb/A of butoxyethanol ester of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) during June and 1 or 1 1/2 lb/A during August of the second and third years. (2) Bromegrass seeded with an oat companion crop sprayed with 1/3 lb/A of 2,4-D ester the first year and annual applications of 2,4-D in June and mid-August during the second and third years. The best use of non-selective herbicides in two 2-year trials was spring application of 4 lb/A of diethylamine salt of 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA) or 6 lb/A of diethylamine salt of polychlorobenzoic acid (PBA), plowing 10 days later, and a corn crop sprayed with 1/3 lb/A of 2,4-D ester followed by a spring-seeded oat crop sprayed with 1/3 lb/A of 2,4-D ester and postharvest application of 4 to 6 lb/A of 2,3,6-TBA and 6 to 8 lb/A of PBA, and plowing 10 days later. Reinfestation from established plants was not prevented, but annual application of 2,4-D prevented reinfestation from seedlings.
10.2307/4040585|The fate of 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron), 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine), and 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-2-triazine (atrazine) in Wymore silty clay loam soil at Lincoln, Bridgeport loam soil at North Platte, and Rosebud loam soil at Alliance, Nebraska, was followed during a 16-month period. Oats grown for 40 days in the field as a bioassay crop showed that simazine and atrazine were less phytotoxic in the finer textured soil where the rainfall was highest. Soybean bioassays in soil from different horizons showed a higher concentration of monuron remaining in the 0- to 3-inch soil horizons than of simazine or atrazine. There was a marked decrease of monuron phytotoxicity in the 3- to 18-inch soil layer 16 months after as compared to 4 months after the herbicide application. Atrazine showed the greatest leaching of the three herbicides in this study.
10.2307/4040578| Spectrophotometric and chemical analyses indicated that photodecomposition of 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid [amiben] in water solution occurred rapidly during exposure to sunlight or light from fluorescent sun lamps. Slow but definite photochemical alteration occurred when dry amiben on filter paper was exposed to light from the sun lamps. Several reaction products were separated by paper chromatography. Loss of herbicidal activity from 10 molar aqueous solutions of amiben approximated disappearance of amiben determined colorimetrically. Photochemical inactivation of the formulated triethylamine salt of amiben in aqueous solution was slower than that of chromatographically pure amiben. A method involving diazotization of amiben with nitrous acid and coupling the diazo form with chromotropic acid was suitable for quantitative determination of amiben. 
10.2307/4040571| Autoradiographs following treatment of Cyperus esculentus L. with C-labeled amitrole indicated that it was readily translocated from the point of application to the seed. Seed germination was significantly reduced following amitrole applications. 
10.2307/4040575| During a 12-hr incubation low concentrations of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) enhance the metabolic breakdown of ribonucleic acid (RNA) whereas high concentrations of the auxin almost completely inhibit RNA breakdown after 4 hr of treatment. The data, from experiments where the incorporation of adenosine-8-C into RNA was followed, clearly show that the role of auxin in this system is not to appreciably alter net synthesis of RNA, but rather to alter some process(s) related to the degradative metabolism of RNA. 
10.2307/4040548|Radioactive sodium salt of 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon) was applied to the leaves or to the roots of sugar beets, a species tolerant of the herbicide, and yellow foxtail (Setaria glauca), a susceptible species. Autoradiographs indicated that dalapon entered through the leaves and roots, and moved throughout all portions of both species within 48 hours. Accumulation of dalapon was greatest in the younger tissues of both species. Paper chromatographic separations of aqueous extracts of the plants indicated no metabolic derivatives of dalapon in either species.
10.2307/4040555|The treatments in this 3-year study consisted of 54, 12, 6, 3, 1, 1/2, and no foxtail plants per foot of crop row. Yield reductions for the heaviest stand of foxtail averaged 25% for corn and 28% for soybeans. For both corn and soybeans, the increase in foxtail dry matter was proportional to the decrease in the dry matter from the crop; the combined yield did not vary significantly. As stand of foxtail increased, there was a decrease in yields of grain, cobs, stalks or straw, diameter of cornstalks, ear weight, light intensity beneath the crop, soil temperatures under corn, and number of soybean pods. There was little or no significant effect on moisture content of grain, height of crop, shelling percentage of corn, oil or protein content of beans, weight of 100 beans or number of beans per pod. Increased corn lodging was associated with increasing foxtail stand in one of three years.
10.2307/4040562|Amiben (3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid) was applied to the surface of various soil types in cylinders which were then leached with water. The leached soil was tested biologically for herbicide activity. Loss was most rapid from sand, followed by clay, with muck remaining phytotoxic much longer. There was only a slight increase in the toxicity of loam soil given repeated treatments with amiben. Incubation of treated soil for various periods of time indicated that microorganism breakdown is important in soils relatively high in organic matter.
10.2307/4040552|Toxicity of 3,6-endoxohexahydrophthalic acid (endothal) was measured by the inhibition of growth of germinating flax roots, compared to known standards. In the field, endothal applied at 0.3 to 10.0 ppm was not detectable after an average of 2 1/2 days, and a maximum of 4 days. In aquaria, endothal at these rates was detectable much longer than this, and much longer when the aquaria contained only water than when they also contained mud and plant debris.
10.2307/4040560|Rhizomes were sampled from quackgrass sod weekly during two seasons. The activity of buds on one-bud sections from mature rhizomes was used to determine periods of growth and dormancy. The rhizome buds showed a steady decrease in activity from mid-April to June 1. During June, the buds were dormant. Recovery began in late June and continued the rest of the summer. Only one-third of all rhizome material in a three-year-old sod was viable. The amount of viable mature rhizomes decreased during the season while the viable new rhizomes increased, and the total viable level remained fairly constant. This suggested a definite cycle in rhizome production and decomposition from year to year and a short life-period in the soil. The term "late-spring dormancy" is suggested for quackgrass rhizomes, based on the prevailing cool and moist weather conditions and the late-spring time of occurrence during the year. This distinguishes the type of dormancy described from "summer dormancy".
10.2307/4040557| Dalapon-2-C, applied as droplets, was employed in tracer studies by autoradiography and counting. That dalapon remained non-metabolized throughout the experiment was confirmed by chromatography. Surfactants greatly enhanced (cuticular) penetration. Small amounts of herbicide were sorbed almost instantaneously (15-30 seconds). Movement away from the treated area "showed" or "appeared as" first a diffusional pattern, but soon became channelized in veinlets and larger vascular bundles. Dalapon applied off the midvein did not enter the midvein in appreciable quantities during basipetal transport. Dalapon which entered the midrib originally remained highly concentrated in this channel. During transport, some dalapon was retained or retarded by tissues through which it passed. Retention was greatest in the basal sections (intercalary meristem regions) of young grass blades. A 10-fold build-up of dalapon was demonstrated following drop application off the main vein, but not after treatment on the midrib. Results are explicable on the basis of the known anatomy of Zea and the translocation of dalapon with assimilates. 
10.2307/4040553| The method was based on the minimum dosage of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) that would produce strapping or cupping of cotton leaves. Dilutions of an unknown were applied to cotton cotyledons. The minimum dosage required to produce strapped or cupped leaves two weeks later was approximately 0.05 g/plant. The results of this bioassay were comparable to tracer methods, but the latter can detect smaller quantities of 2,4-D. 
10.2307/4040564|Wheat, bean, and pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus) seeds were immersed in solutions of 2,4-D (ester) and MCPA (ester) ranging from 0.001 ppm. and then germinated in petri dishes. Both products induced analogous effects but MCPA appeared to be slightly less active. Germination in pigweed was promoted by the 0.1 ppm. solutions. Growth of plummule and radicle in wheat was stimulated by lower (0.001 to 1 ppm.) concentrations and depressed by higher ones (100 and 1000 ppm.), the threshold between stimulation and depression being around 10 to 100 ppm. depending on the product and the organ affected.
10.2307/4040556| Wild cucumber (Sicyos angulatus) and cultivated cucumber (Cucumis sativus) were treated with carboxyl-labeled C2,4-D (2,4-D*) and 2,4,5-T (2,4,5-T*) and autoradiographs developed. The distribution pattern of 2,4-D* was achieved in 24 hours and changed little by the end of 4 or 8 days. The pattern of 2,4,5-T* translocation continued to change during an 8-day period, indicating a highly mobile compound. Metabolic studies indicated that considerably more 2,4-D* than 2,4,5-T* was absorbed by these species but 75% of the absorbed 2,4-D* was converted into two major metabolites within 24 hours. The absorbed 2,4,5-T* formed only traces of these metabolites even after 8 days. Evolution of CO was approximately 10 times greater from 2,4-D*-treated plants than from 2,4,5-T*-treated plants. The greater phytotoxicity of 2,4,5-T on these species seems to be related to the inability of the plants to detoxify this compound as rapidly as 2,4-D. 
10.2307/4040554| Effects of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T), 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) and 4-(2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxy)butyric acid [4-(MCPB)] on Oxalis latifolia H.B.K. were compared. 2,4,5-T killed leaves and up to 50% bulbs, 2,4-D was slightly less effective while MCPA and MCPB killed or distorted leaves but did not affect bulbs appreciably. Effectiveness of spray was increased by spraying in the evening rather than the morning and by applying nutrient solution for three weeks prior to spraying, but spray additives, sucrose, boric acid or urea gave no significant alteration. Studies with C-labelled 2,4-D indicated accumulation in rapidly developing organs with less movement to organs of slower development. 
10.2307/4040565|The percentage of quackgrass (Agropyron repens (L.) Beauv.) rhizome buds producing shoots was greater with one-inch than with six-inch or longer rhizomes. The longer the rhizome cutting, the stronger the shoot and the greater the recovery from deep planting. Recovery of rhizomes covered with four or more inches of soil was poor. Atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropyl-amino-s-triazine) at 1 1/2 and 3 lb per acre did not affect the number of shoots produced. It was more effective when applied 1/2 inch above rhizomes than one inch or three inches above them.
10.2307/4040558|Species studied at Lincoln, Nebraska for 4 years were downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.), hairy chess (B. commutatus Schrad.), Japanese chess (B. japonicus Thunb.), and cheat (B. secalinus L.). These grasses were usually winter annuals, but also became spring annuals or biennials when sown in late March or early April. In the greenhouse, an inductive period either of vernalization or short day lengths appeared necessary for panicle production by downy brome and hairy chess. For both species, long day lengths following the inductive period were necessary for flowering. When a mixture of smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.) and 5.4 per cent of weed bromegrasses was sown in the fall, weed bromes made up 48 per cent of the total basal density and 87 per cent of the total seed yield the following summer. Panicles of weed bromes were absent or nearly so when this mixture was soon after April 1. The best time for mowing hairy chess and downy brome for their control in pasture was approximately one week after the heads had emerged. Practical control of weed bromegrasses has generally been obtained by prevention of seed production for two years. A practical program has included killing all emerged weed bromegrasses by tillage between April 1 and heading. A spring cereal or row crop, such as corn or sorghum, was then planted. The next season, timely tillage followed by the above crops, or summer fallow, has permitted return of fields to the usual alternate winter wheat and fallow sequence. Effective control of weed bromegrasses also was accomplished by isopropyl N-phenylcarbamate (IPC), isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate (CIPC), 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron), sodium salt of trichloracetic acid (TCA), 3,6-endoxohexahydrophthalic acid (endothal), 4,6-dinitro-o-sec-amylphenol (DNAP), and mixtures of these herbicides.
10.2307/4040549|The sodium salt of 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon) at 4 lb per acre was applied as a foliar spray to sugar beets, a species tolerant of the herbicide, and yellow foxtail (Setaria glauca), a susceptible species. Shoots of treated and untreated plants were collected during three weeks after treatment and assayed. Dalapon appeared to cause protein degradation to amino acids in the shoots of both species. Striking increases in the concentration of amides (primarily glutamine in sugar beets and asparagine in yellow foxtail) were found. The free pantothenic acid in the shoots of both species rose greatly following treatment. In sugar beets, observed recovery of treated plants was accompanied by return of the concentrations of the constituents studied to levels near those in untreated plants. Yellow foxtail did not recover after treatment and concentrations of the constituents studied generally remained at a high level compared to the untreated plants. The similarity in initial biochemical responses of the two species and the fact that sugar beets recovered may indicate that some mechanism capable of inactivating dalapon was operating in sugar beets.
10.2307/4040561|In semi-arid areas, good control of field bindweed with 1 lb/A of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) will occur if there is at least 1.5 inches of available soil moisture when runners are 6 to 10 inches long. Under these conditions carbohydrates are high in the leaves and low in the roots. Analysis of rainfall records from Amarillo, Texas indicates that soil moisture conditions during May will be favorable for good bindweed control with 2,4-D 54% of the time.
10.2307/4040566|Placements which did not wet the root collar and sprouting zone gave poor kills of roots.
10.2307/4040559|Among 15 different herbicides tested for eradication of Turkey oak (Quercus laevis Walt.) over a period of four years on Lakeland fine sand in Florida, only monuron, diuron, and fenuron at minimal rates of 10 lb/A were effective. One full growing season after application was required for complete kill. Phenoxy compounds gave variable top-kill but not satisfactory control. AMS, dalapon, and four formulations of benzoic acid were ineffective in these tests. Out of 13 different grasses, Pensacola bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Flugge) and weeping lovegrass (Eragrostis curvula Schrad.) were best adapted to these deep sandy soils. Seedbed preparation was essential to obtain a good stand of either. After establishment, the lovegrass vigorously persisted throughout the experiment; the bahia also persisted but the lack of fertilization was extremely evident. Both grasses could be established satisfactorily on soil treated two years earlier with monuron or diuron at 10 lb/A.
10.2307/4040551|The effect of PBA, dalapon and amitrole applications on the osmotic pressure, electrical conductivity and pH of quackgrass rhizome sap and the total nitrogen and hygroscopic capacity of dried rhizomes, from May 17 through October 15, are reported. Characteristic seasonal curves were developed for all five specific factors studied. The herbicide treatments accentuated the variation in some of these factors but did not appreciably modify the seasonal curves.
10.2307/4040550|The toxicity indices to cotton of 12 soil-incorporated herbicides were highly and positively correlated with soil organic matter, cation exchange capacity, exchangeable calcium, moisture equivalent, free drainage value and total exchangeable bases. The characteristics of the responses indicate that adsorption of the 12 herbicides on organic matter occurs and that this greatly affects their toxicity. For equal toxicity approximately five times more herbicide was required at 20% organic matter than at 4% regardless of the herbicide involved.
10.2307/4040563| Carboxyl labeled 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) was applied to ironweed, a perennial composite, at various stages of growth in the field and greenhouse. During phases of rapid plant development, C tended to concentrate in new leaves, axillary buds, petioles and stems. As plants approached full vegetative development greater quantities were detected in rhizomes and roots and less in stems and leaves. The herbicide was translocated readily into new leaves, stems and roots of ironweed seedlings. Considerable quantities of 2,4-D-C absorbed by ironweed were rapidly metabolized to compounds not extracted by alcohol. Non-herbicide activity was also found in alcohol extracted fractions. C accumulations in field-treated ironweed were detected in roots and rhizomes 3 to 6 weeks after treatment. 
10.2307/4040845|In trials by three methods, witchweed (Striga asiatica) did not parasitize pineapple.
10.2307/4040827|In undrained soil or solution cultures of oats or barley, the effects of hours of exposure and concentration of 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon) on height and fresh weight were equivalent. Dalapon was shown to be a growth inhibitor in corn coleoptile and pea stem sections but was inactive in oat coleoptile sections. Dalapon was antagonistic to IAA induced growth in corn coleoptile sections and 2,4-D induced growth in pea stem and oat coleoptile sections. The antagonism was reversible in pea and oat tissue, but was competitive in pea stem sections. Dalapon was shown to be an anti-auxin.
10.2307/4040833|The effects of rainfall and temperature upon herbicidal activity of 2-chloro-N,N-diallylacetamide (CDAA), 2-chloro-4,6-bis-(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine), and 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine), for the control of foxtail (Setaria spp.) were determined. CDAA spray was effective if applied to warm soil and if 1/2 inch of rain fell during the first week after application, unless a heavy rain fell immediately after application. The effectiveness of granules was not impaired by a heavy rain immediately after treatment or by a delay of 2 weeks before receiving 1/2 inch of rain. Simazine and atrazine sprays and granules were effective if 1 inch of rain fell within 15 days after application of simazine or if 1/2 to 1 inch fell within 15 to 20 days afterwards for atrazine. Mechanical incorporation aided in activation of simazine when rainfall was slightly below minimum required for activation.
10.2307/4040829|Repeated applications of amine methylarsonate over a two year period resulted in significant reductions in nutsedge tuber numbers at 1.3, 2.6 and 3.8 ounces per 1000 sq. ft. Single annual applications of amine methylarsonate at the same rates were ineffective. Amine methylarsonate and disodium monomethylarsonate treatments gave moderate reductions in nutsedge tuber numbers in thin Bermudagrass turf after one season.
10.2307/4040830|Mixed stands of big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt.) and green rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus (Hook.) Nutt.) were sprayed with butyl ester of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) at 1, 2, 3, and 4 lb/A on six phenological dates in 1956, 1957, and 1958 at the Squaw Butte Experiment Station, Burns, Oregon. Data on soil moisture; soil temperature; growth development of herbaceous species; twig elongation of big sagebrush and green rabbitbrush; dry-matter, crude-protein, and total-carbohydrate contents of green rabbitbrush herbage; and crude-protein and total-carbohydrate contents of big sagebrush and green rabbitbrush roots were obtained at weekly to biweekly intervals in all 3 years to evaluate the ecological and physiological conditions that might indicate seasonal patterns of susceptibility to 2,4-D. Big sagebrush, a non-deciduous, non-sprouting plant, was easily killed with 2,4-D at 2 lb/A when soil temperatures and moisture contents were satisfactory for vigorous growth. The development of abundant leaf area on green rabbitbrush, a deciduous, sprouting plant, was important for spray interception and a photosynthetic rate sufficient to promote carbohydrate accumulation. Green rabbitbrush was controlled about 80% with a single application of 2,4-D butyl ester at 3 lb/A after the new twigs were 3 inches long and while soil moisture contents were sufficient for active growth. Differences in susceptibility between the two species are compared with morphological, phenological, and physiological differences, and seasonal patterns of susceptibility are further compared with environmental conditions.
10.2307/4040846|Seeds of witchweed (Striga asiatica) were found in undisturbed Lakeland sand in all layers to 60 inches deep.
10.2307/4040831| Radioactive sucrose-C and serine-C were "fed" to excised leaves from red kidney bean plants at various times following atrazine treatment. The distribution of C in the various labeled compounds was determined by two-dimensional paper chromatography and subsequent elution and counting. The results indicated that other processes entirely independent of the photosynthetic block are also involved in the herbicidal action. Atrazine did not affect the rate of respiration of excised embryos of red kidney bean plants. 
10.2307/4040832|Inulin or a closely related analog was the major available carbohydrate component of western ironweed (Vernonia baldwinii Torr.) roots. Fructose, glucose, sucrose and other glucofructosans made up the remaining carbohydrate fraction. Reductions in ironweed vigor as a result of annual mowing were caused by a decrease in dry weight of the root system rather than a permanent decrease in carbohydrate percentage. Use of carbohydrate percentage in predicting a physiological condition of ironweed was regarded as questionable. Carbohydrate content of roots was not necessarily related to stage of growth. Treatment of ironweed with 2,4-D did not permanently affect carbohydrate levels in the roots. Changes in root carbohydrate content after 2,4-D treatment were not considered decisive in killing ironweed.
10.2307/4040847|This herbicide, plus the 2,4 and 2,4,5 compounds, has remained active in the soil for 6 years on a Norfolk fine sandy loam in an area with about 49 inches of rainfall per year. The residue produced formative effects on tobacco leaves throughout this time.
10.2307/4040839|Fish used in these tests were the Israeli strain of the common carp, Cyprinus carpio; the Nile tilapia, Tilapia nilotica; the Java tilapia, T. mossambica; and the Congo tilapia, T. melanopleura. Israeli carp and either Nile or Java tilapia in ponds containing only these species virtually eliminated aquatic weeds, but when stocked into established populations of largemouth bass and bluegill results were less encouraging.
10.2307/4040836|Excavation at biweekly intervals for 20 weeks of nutsedge clones grown from single tubers indicated that no dormant tubers formed until 6 weeks after foliar emergence. Tuber chains or fully mature rhizomes were not observed until the tenth week or long tuber chains until the eighteenth week. Rhizome length and tuber-basal bulb number increased throughout the season. Development of clones varied.
10.2307/4040840|The propylene glycol butyl ether ester of 2,4-D or the dimethylamine salt of 2,3,6-TBA in 25 gallons water per acre effectively controlled Colorado rubberweed (Hymenoxys richardsonii (Hook.) Cockerell) at the prebud stage. From 2 to 4 pounds acid equivalent per acre of an ester of 2,4-D were satisfactory, depending on the relative importance of cost and speed of kill.
10.2307/4040837| Approximately 75% of the inhibitory effect of a foliar application of 4-chloro-2-butynyl N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamate (barban) on wheat was eliminated by dusting the seed before planting with 4-chloro-2-hydroxyiminoacetanilide at a rate of one ounce per bushel. Other highly effective antidotes were 2,4-dichloro-9-xanthenone and N-methyl-3,4-dichlorobenzene sulfonamide. Barban antidotes were found in those chemicals that produced formative effects on plants. 
10.2307/4040843|Fresh seed of Tamarix pentandra Pall. germinated at 36 to 132 F., freely at 66 to 110 F. Seed stored at the same relative humidity maintained viability best at low temperatures. Viability of seed stored at a low relative humidity continued high for 6 months over a wide range of temperature, but viability was reduced within 15 days by relative humidity of 90-95%.
10.2307/4040828|For the control of wild garlic in Missouri in comparison with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) during 1954-1960, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole), sodium 2,2-dichloropropionate (dalapon), maleic hydrazide (MH), 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid (fenac) and 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA) were effective. 2,3,6-TBA alone was more effective than 2,4-D. The toxicity of 2,3,6-TBA was increased by addition of a wetting agent. Heavy spot treatments of wild garlic with 2,3,6-TBA killed the established plants, but did not eradicate wild garlic because of sprouting of dormant bulbs.
10.2307/4040838|Red alder (Alnus rubra Bong.) was readily killed by growing season treatments with a 1 to 1 mixture of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) in diesel oil. Except for 1-inch-diameter trees, it was resistant to dormant season treatments. Treatments applied during moderate rain were less effective than during rain-free periods.
10.2307/4040842|A mobile, metal cabinet sprayer is described, in which an electrically-powered, chain-driven carriage with spray assembly travels back and forth over the pots or flats to be sprayed.
10.2307/4040835|In field plantings, granular 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) and 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron) were the most effective herbicides, but injured Spiraea media, S. trichocarpa, Syringa prestoniae and Physocarpus opulifolius. Diuron also injured newly planted evergreens. Granular 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben), isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamate (CIPC), 2-chloroallyl diethyldithiocarbamate (CDEC) and 4,6-dinitro-o-sec-butylphenol (DNBP) did not cause injury. Preplanting application of ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (EPTC) reduced the vigor of the deciduous shrubs. Chamaecyparis and Thuja species were tolerant to simazine under greenhouse conditions, while tolerance in Juniperus varied according to species.
10.2307/4040841|A 7-foot V-plow was modified so herbicides could be sprayed beneath the soil surface in stubble mulch fallow operations. This permits the incorporation of volatile herbicides without destroying plant residues. Weed control is achieved by action of the 7-foot sweeps during the herbicide application and later by the incorporated herbicide.
10.2307/4040834|The herbicide, N-(3-chloro-4-methylphenyl)-2-methylpentanamide was applied to the foliage of tomato, a tolerant species, and eggplant, a susceptible species. Both species increased in tolerance to the herbicide with age but tomato increased at a much faster rate. Selectivity did not appear to be a function of differential wetting of foliage. Photosynthesis was shown to be involved in the phytotoxic action of the herbicide and starvation is suggested as a possible mode of action. Carbohydrates increased the tolerance of tomato plants and the fixation of labeled carbon dioxide in eggplant leaves was prevented by the herbicide.
10.2307/4040654|Patterns of absorption and distribution of dalapon (2,2-dichloropropionic acid) were determined by radioautography and counting. Dalapon was absorped through the cuticle and through the large open pores of hypostomatous leaves. Stomata were clearly the most expeditious routes of entry, but results were erratic when no surfactant was included. An anionic surfactant, sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate, enhanced both (a) cuticular and (b) stomatal plus cuticular penetration 3- to 4-fold during a 2-hr. absorption period. Studies confirmed the view that dalapon is translocated to regions of high metabolic activity and/or storage in association with and dependent upon the movement of food materials. Dalapon did not move appreciably out of albino leaves or green leaves previously depleted of food reserves, but was transported readily out of normal leaves in the light when a surfactant was used to enhance cuticular penetration.
10.2307/4040658|In the Peace River region, vegetative shoots of field horsetail, Equisetum arvense L., emerge from June 1 to July 1, and reach full growth about July 16. All herbicides studied were most effective applied July 16 to 30. Amitrole (3-amino-1,2,4-triazole) at 8 lb/A at this time gave 96% stand reduction the next year. For selective killing in barley, MCPA (2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid) at 4 to 8 oz/A killed 100% of the top growth in the year of application and gave 50 to 65% stand reduction the next year. Other herbicides tried were less effective.
10.2307/4040664| A procedure has been described for the partial purification of the simazine-resistance factor of Zea. The relative solubilities in various solvents and some of the chemical properties of this factor have been studied. Pyridine and hydroxylamine were also found to bring about the conversion of simazine- C to the 2-hydroxy analogue. Based on these substances as models, a mechanism has been proposed for the dechlorination of simazine in Zea. 
10.2307/4040659|All herbicides were incorporated either as pretransplanting or posttransplanting treatments. Herbicides used were: ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (EPTC), propyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (1607), ethyl N,N-ethyl-n-butylthiolcarbamate (2060), propyl N,N-ethyl-n-butylthiolcarbamate (2061), O-(2,4-dichlorophenyl) O-methyl isopropylphosphoramidothioate (DMPA), 2-chloro-4-diethylamino-6-ethylamino-s-triazine (trietazine), and the dimethyl ester of 2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalic acid (DCPA). EPTC, 1607, 2060, and 2061 at 3 lb/A (repeated 3 times), posttransplanting, and DMPA at 20 lb/A, pretransplanting, gave control of the annual weeds present with the exception of annual morningglory, and had no effects on tobacco yield or value. Nicotine, nornicotine, total alkaloids, and reducing sugar content of the cured leaf were not adversely affected by the thiolcarbamates, DMPA, amiben, or DCPA at rates used. Smoke and taste tests of tobacco treated with EPTC, DMPA, amiben, and DCPA revealed no undesirable flavors.
10.2307/4040657|Applications of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyethyl sulfate (sesone) were made to obtain a wide range of formative response in peanut seedlings. These reactions were rated (0 = no effect, 10 = complete kill) as the peanut seedlings emerged, and correlated with growth and development of the plants. It appears that plants from seedlings in the 0 to 3 range of response have an excellent chance to develop into healthy, productive plants. The seedlings in the 3 to 5 range have a questionable chance. The seedlings in the 6 to 10 range have little chance, because root rots were both frequent and severe at 8 to 9 weeks after seeding.
10.2307/4040661|Winter wheat infested with four populations of coast fiddleneck (Amsinckia intermedia Fisch. & May) was treated with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). One weed per square foot reduced grain yield. Weeds competed strongly as early as the rosette stage. Treating the weed infested wheat with 2,4-D increased yield. A vigorous, early-established crop of wheat competed effectively with the weeds.
10.2307/4040656|Nutsedge tubers germinated readily in soil treated with EPTC. However, growth was suppressed and emergence delayed, the delay depending on the rate of application. EPTC at 12 and 16 pounds per acre with 8 and 12 weeks exposure was very effective in killing nutsedge tubers as indicated by tuber germination and condition of tubers that did not germinate. The granular formulation of EPTC killed highly significantly more nutsedge tubers than the emulsifiable formulation. Repeat applications of EPTC were significantly better in terms of tubers killed than single applications of the same rate of the herbicide. Thorough incorporation of EPTC to a depth of 5 inches of mechanical means was significantly more effective than incorporation by leaching.
10.2307/4040665|Seedlings of barnyardgrass, green foxtail, and yellow foxtail emerged from seeds as deep as 5 inches in Sagemoor fine sandy loam. The number of emerged seedlings from depths of 4 to 5 inches decreased in the order of decreasing seed weights; yellow foxtail, barnyardgrass, green foxtail. Few seedlings developed in the field from seeds on the soil surface. Seedling emergence in spring or greenhouse seedings was greatest from the most shallow depths (1/2 or 1 inch) and decreased regularly as depth of planting increased. An autumn seeding gave maximum emergence at 1 1/2 inches, possibly because some seeds sown shallower may have germinated in short warm periods but were killed by subsequent freezing.
10.2307/4040666|Comparative studies of herbicides and herbicide mixtures were conducted at Tifton, Georgia, in 1959 and 1960. Certain mixtures, which contained sodium 2,4-dichlorophenoxyethyl sulfate (sesone), tris(2,4-dichlorophenoxyethyl) phosphite (2,4-DEP), or the triethylamine salt of 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben) mixed with the alkanolamine salt of 4,6-dinitro-o-sec-butylphenol (DNBP), gave seasonal weed control on band-treated peanuts. Compared to herbicides applied singly, mixtures not only increased the spectrum of weeds controlled but also permitted the use of the lowest rate of each component on the weeds for which it was most effective.
10.2307/4040663|Medusahead (Elymus caput-medusae L.) matures later in the spring than most associated species, and has a seed head moisture content of above 30 per cent for approximately a month after leaves and stems begin to dry. High temperature is more injurious to seed viability when seed moisture content is high. Control burns of medusahead infested rangeland were most effective in late afternoon when burning slowly (into a mild wind) and at the soft dough stage of medusahead seed development.
10.2307/4040651|Cluster tarweed (Madia glomerata Hook.) is an annual which occupies rangeland from Saskatchewan to N. Arizona at medium to high elevations. In the laboratory dried tarweed plants and leachates from them reduced the germination of intermediate wheatgrass (Agropyron intermedium (Host) Beauv.) and radish, and caused high proportions of abnormal seedlings. The inhibitory agent(s) was highly water soluble, dialyzable, stable to boiling, drying, and prolonged storage in solution, destroyed by ashing, and not affected by pH 4 to 7. In soil in the greenhouse, tarweed leachates and dried tarweed significantly reduced growth of wheatgrass seedlings. In the field, tarweed infestation reduced the establishment and growth of wheatgrass sown in it in proportion to the stand of tarweed.
10.2307/4040655|A significant amount of amiben (3-amino-2,4-dichlorobenzoic acid) was leached from the 0 to 1-inch soil depth with 1 and 2 inches of applied water. Weed control could be obtained from amiben at 1 lb/A if rain came within 3 or 4 days after application. One-half inch of water applied immediately after application markedly increased the toxicity of 1 lb of amiben per acre to Brassica juncea (L.) Coss and Panicum miliaceum L.; a similar response from 2 lb/A was obtained with 1/4 inch of water. As the amiben rate was increased, less water was required for optimum weed control. Increased water and/or amiben applications were required with Brassica campestris L., which is somewhat resistant to amiben.
10.2307/4040653|Spot-treatments of young cotton with 2,2-dichloropropionic acid, simulating control of clumps of perennial grass, resulting in 10 to 25% reductions in cotton stands, did not cause proportional reductions in yields of seed cotton. Increased growth of cotton plants adjacent to skips compensated for reduced stands. The treatments did not affect boll components or fiber properties of cotton.
10.2307/4040662|During a 48 hour period after spraying with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) the ribonucleic acid (RNA) in the subcellular particles of soybean hypocotyl tissue doubled with over half of the increase appearing in the microsomal fraction and one quarter in the soluble fraction. It is hoypothesized that the herbicidal action of 2,4-D lies in a renewal of nuclear activity in the tissue, leading to a synthesis of RNA and protein and to tissue proliferation, and that the cytochemical basis of auxin-herbicide action lies in a reversion to a meristematic metabolism.
10.2307/4040660|Weed control has been a major problem in Hawaiian pineapple production. Hand-hoeing and mechanical cultivation gave way to activated oil emulsion sprays in the 1940's. The 1950's brought the use of preemergence herbicides especially 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron). Each method has brought a shift in species distribution. Today, large-seeded species and vegetatively-propagated species are less well-controlled than in the days of contact weeding with oil emulsion sprays. There is need for selective herbicides which will control the weeds which escape the present program.
10.2307/4040652|Yellow rocket (Barbarea vulgaris R. Br.) was studied for 5 years under field conditions. Yellow rocket seeds germinated throughout the growing season, but vernalization of the rosettes formed was necessary for flowering. There appeared to be a minimum size plant that could be vernalized. In the spring vernalized rosettes formed flower stalks. As the flower stalk elongated, basal rosette leaves died, giving the impression of an annual. When the flower stalk was cut or seed matured, new rosette leaves developed from buds on the crown. This new growth was capable of going through the subsequent winter. Marked plants survived for at least 3 years. The ability to flower again and set viable seed in the same year after cutting appeared to be associated with the stage of the original flower stalk when cut. Yellow rocket is perennial, but it may not survive after its second year under conditions of disease or strong competition.
10.2307/4040781|Oats, sesbania (Sesbania macrocarpa Muhl.) and purple nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus L.) were grown as test plants in nine different soil types treated with 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 ppm of ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (EPTC). Toxicity of EPTC was negatively correlated with the organic matter of the soil. A positive correlation was found between the sand and silt content of the soil and EPTC toxicity to oats and nutsedge. Toxicity of EPTC was not correlated with soil pH, cation exchange capacity, clay content, general reaction, or parent material. EPTC induced a dormancy of nutsedge tubers, of which the length was inversely related to the organic content of the soil.
10.2307/4040782|Isopropyl N-phenylcarbamate (IPC) and isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamate (CIPC) were the most effective herbicides for controlling downy brome without serious injury to perennial grasses grown for seed production in eastern Washington. The di-sodium salt of 3,6-endoxohexahydrophthallic acid (endothal) gave good downy brome control at Spokane, but was not satisfactory for control at Hooper and Pomeroy, Washington.
10.2307/4040789|Seeds of white spruce (Picea glauca, Moench), Colorado spruce (P. pungens, Engelm.), and Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) were treated with simazine in water at rates up to 1000 ppm for 20 hours, washed 10 min., rinsed twice, and sown. There was no effect on Colorado spruce or Scotch pine, but white spruce seeds were seriously affected above 250 ppm. Simazine has been considered not to affect seeds.
10.2307/4040792| Carbon carboxy labeled 2,4-D with varied amounts of Tween 20 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate) was applied to excised Kalmia angustifolia L. (Ericaceae) leaves and, after an absorption period, the radioactivity of the dried ground leaf tissue was measured by counting. Entry rate of 2,4-D into recently formed leaves decreased with increase in Tween 20, within the range of 2,4-D/Tween 20 ratios used (roughly 5/1 to 0.5/1). Entry rate of 2,4-D into older leaves increased with increase in Tween 20. 
10.2307/4040786|Disking, relisting, cultivation and no repreparation were employed in repreparing for planting seedbeds that had received preemergence treatment with 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)1,1-dimethylurea (diuron). Only the relisting method of seedbed repreparation appeared hazardous with respect to crop injury from herbicidal residues. Retreatment with diuron tended to increase injury symptoms in replanted cotton but yields were not significantly reduced by retreatment. Early-season weed competition, preventable by preemergence treatment, appeared to be more hazardous to yields than slight to moderate herbicidal injury to the cotton. Cotton replanted on plots treated once or treated twice significantly outyielded that on untreated plots in one of the two years in which all plots were replanted.
10.2307/4040790|Salmonberry (Rubus spectabilis Pursh.) was basally treated in Western Oregon during the dormant season and at bud bursting in April, using a 1:1 mixture of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T), and the same mixture of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T monobutyl ether glycol esters, and 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA), in two carriers and with different additives, and with diesel oil alone. January applications gave generally poorer results than those in March and April. March and April applications produced 100% defoliation and kill for all treatments, with only erratic exceptions. Diesel oil alone gave effective control only in April. Sprays containing 2 1/2% active ingredients gave as good results as those containing 5%.
10.2307/4040791|A year's study of the kinds of weed seeds caught in an 18-mesh copper screen intercepting half the canal width found seeds of 20 species or genera. Bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon) was found every month of the year; saltgrass (Distichlis spicata) only in March; others in 2 to 10 months of the year.
10.2307/4040784|White mustard (Brassica hirta Moench) and foxtail millet (Setaria italica (L.) Beauv.), thinned to uniform stands, varied in a three-year study in their effects on peas depending on weed population, duration of competition, relative time of pea and weed emergence, and year to year variations in seasonal rainfall. Full-season competition from 3 mustard plants per square foot reduced pea stands 0 to 25%, pea vine weight 39 to 71%, and yields of shelled peas 0 to 64%, during the three years. In one direct comparison, 27 foxtail plants per square foot caused reductions in peas comparable to those caused by 3 mustard plants. When mustard emerged 3 days before peas, fresh weight of pea vines was reduced 54 percent; but when mustard emerged 4 days after peas, only 17 percent. The relative growth rates of peas, Brassica hirta, B. Kaber, Amaranthus retroflexus, Polygonum Persicaria, Setaria italica, S. viridis, S. glauca, and Echinochloa crusgalli grown without intra- and inter-species competition suggest that the Brassica species would be the more severe competitors with peas and that weed competition usually would be more severe in late-seeded peas.
10.2307/4040785| The effect of 4,6-dinitro-o-sec-butylphenol(DNBP) and several phenylureas, s-triazines, chlorinated phenoxyacetic acids and chlorinated benzoic acids on the photolytic activity (Hill reaction) of chloroplasts isolated from turnip greens (Brassica spp.) was studied. Photochemical activity was measured potentiometrically with ferricyanide as the electron acceptor. For the various members of each herbicidal group close agreements were obtained between inhibitions expressed against the Hill reaction and their relative phytotoxicities, except for the chlorinated benzoic acids. Of the five phenylureas tested, 1-n-butyl-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methylurea (neburon) and 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron) were most inhibitory and 3-phenyl-1,1-dimethylurea (fenuron) was least inhibitory to the Hill reaction. 2-Chloro-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (propazine) and 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) were the most inhibitory and 2-chloro-4,6-bis(diethylamino)-s-triazine (chlorazine) was the least inhibitory of seven s-triazines to the Hill reaction. DNBP inhibited the Hill reaction by 50 percent (I) at 1.3  10 M. An I value of 5.1  10 M was obtained for 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) which was the most inhibitory of the chlorinated phenoxyacetic acids tested. 3,4,5-Trichlorobenzoic acid (3,4,5-TBA) was the most inhibitory chlorinated benzoic acid tested (I = 2  10M). I values were established and compared for chloroplasts isolated from turnip greens, corn and soybeans for diuron, simazine, DNBP, isopropyl N-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)carbamate (3,4-DCIPC), isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamate (CIPC), 2,4,5-T and 3,4,5-TBA. Chloroplasts from the three species were essentially equally sensitive to each of the seven herbicides. Hence, no evidence was obtained which would explain species tolerance or susceptibility. When turnip-green chloroplasts were treated with inhibitory concentrations of diuron, simazine, DNBP, CIPC, 2,4,5-T and 3,4,5-TBA in the dark, the herbicides could be removed by washing without seriously impairing the photolytic activity of the chloroplasts. However, irreversible changes occurred when the chloroplasts were illuminated while in contact with the herbicides, i.e., photolytic activity was not completely restored when the chloroplasts were washed, except with simazine. 
10.2307/4040778|Chemical control of weeds in the Hawaiian sugar industry began in 1913 when experiments with sodium arsenite were first conducted on the Island of Hawaii. Sodium arsenite and some sodium chlorate were the main herbicides in use until a concentrated, activated diesel emulsion (CADE) was developed in 1944. From that time on the chlorophenoxyacetic acids and their compounds, sodium trichloroacetate, sodium 2,2-dichloropropionate, and the substituted ureas and triazines have, in turn, been incorporated into use on plantations for weed control. At present, over a half million acres are sprayed each year at a cost of nearly seven million dollars for labor and material.
10.2307/4040783|The relative tolerance of cucumber and squash to amiben was established for germinating seeds, and for young plants with both foliage and root applications. In all cases, the dosage required for 50% inhibition of growth was 6 to 8 times greater for squash than for cucumber. Root applications of carbon-14 labeled amiben on reciprocal grafts of cucumber and squash plants indicated that the shoots were spared in these experiments by differential blocking of amiben transport from the roots. Shoots of either species appeared tolerant on squash roots and susceptible on cucumber roots. Radioactivity in the shoots of both species was much greater when grafted on cucumber than on squash. Foliage applications of carbon-14 labeled amiben showed more entry into cucumber than squash, but little movement to untreated plant parts in either species.
10.2307/4040788| Aqueous solutions of sodium and calcium polysulfides convert labeled simazine, 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine-2,4,6-C, to a chloroform insoluble, charcoal adsorbable derivative which is thought to be hydroxysimazine, 2-hydroxy-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine-2,4,6-C. In soil, calcium polysulfide accelerates the breakdown of simazine as shown by oat bioassay. These results suggest the possibility of using polysulfides to remove unwanted residues of chlorotriazine herbicides from crop lands. 
10.2307/4040774|The present importance of the discipline of weed control is outlined. More acres in the United States are treated today for weed control than for the control of insects or plant diseases, despite disparity in personnel engaged; e.g., a total in the North Central region of 44 men in weed control, 176 in entomology and 177 in plant pathology.
10.2307/4040775|A review, particularly of the responses to herbicides of photosynthetic processes at the molecular level, with some discussion of the effects of herbicides on cell membranes.
10.2307/4040777|Witchweed (Striga asiatica), a parasitic chlorophyll-bearing plant (Scrophuladiaceae) which attacks corn, sorghum, sugarcane, and more than 60 other important crop plants and weeds belonging to the grass family, was found in North Carolina and South Carolina in 1956. It presents a potential hazard to the production of grain crops with an annual value of more than 5 billion dollars in the United States. Continued extensive surveys indicate that witchweed is now present in 20 counties in North Carolina and 10 in South Carolina on a total of 9,566 farms containing 210,671 acres. Federal interstate and state intrastate quarantines (the first for a weed in the U. S.) were established to reduce its spread. Witchweed produces up to 500,000 microscopic longlived seeds per plant. These do not usually germinate until stimulated by a chemical stimulant secreted by the roots of certain plants. A stimulant has been isolated from corn but its exact chemical structure has not be determined. More than 300 chemicals have been evaluated in the laboratory in attempts to find a synthetic stimulant. Of these, 18 stimulated witchweed seed germination in the laboratory but they have not been evaluated for their effectiveness in controlling witchweed under field conditions. After 4 years of catch or trap crops, excellent control of witchweed has been obtained and highly profitable crops of corn have been produced on heavily infested land. Corn grown continuously with witchweed seed production prevented by 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid [2,4-D] has resulted in excellent witchweed control and high corn yields. Corn grown continuously receiving 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid [fenac] as a pre-planting soil-incorporated treatment and 2,4-D as a post-emergence spray as needed have proved effective full-season control of witchweed. Tobacco and certain other crops cannot be grown in rotation with corn for a period of 2 years after this treatment because of fenac residues in the soil. Other herbicides as pre-planting soil-incorporated or premergence treatments to control broadleaved and grass-type weeds plus 2,4-D to prevent witchweed seed production have been highly effective combinations for witchweed control. Quick eradication of witchweed will not be easy but effective control now and future eradication look favorable.
10.2307/4040787|Annual treatment with 1 lb/A of 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) repeated for several years during mid- to late June gave excellent control of ironweed (Vernonia baldwinii). Later dates of treatment were not as effective. Mowing was not satisfactory as a weed control measure for ironweed. The populations in mowed plots in long-term experiments closely paralleled populations of untreated plots. Where numbers were reduced by spray treatment, recovery or reinfestation was comparatively slow. Quadrat counts were compared with visual estimation as methods of evaluating effects of treatments. The estimation method did not permit quantitative evaluation of year-to-year treatment or environmental effects.
10.2307/4040776|A review of recent work, especially, on the multitude of factors affecting the germination of weed seeds.
10.2307/4040780|During the first season, tubers of purple nutsedge, Cyperus rotundus L. planted in Piedmont Plateau soil at Experiment, Georgia at 1-ft intervals produced 3,090,000 plants and 4,420,000 tubers and bulbs per acre. Tubers planted at 3-ft intervals produced 2,320,000 plants and 2,760,000 tubers and bulbs. The differences were not pronounced at the end of the second season. A single cultivation at the beginning of the second year did not appreciably affect the number of tubers and bulbs formed. Continuous heavy shade during the second year reduced tuber-bulb formation. No apparent interaction between shading and cultivation occurred.
10.2307/4041115| Results were based on plant response with light levels in energy units, in accord with use of the spectrum by plants. Dry weight yields of control plants, and reductions of yields by 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) below those of control plants were greatest in red light, followed by pink, yellow, white, green, and blue light, in that order. Sucrose mixed with 2,4-D or applied alone to plants altered the combined light-herbicide effect but little. Differences in concentration of 2,4-D affected respiration more than photosynthesis, as measured by CO exchange under different light qualities. In spectral effects, pink light caused greatest reduction of photosynthesis by 2,4-D at 500 ppm, while greatest promotion of respiration occurred under red light with 2,4-D at 1000 ppm. 
10.2307/4041123|A substantial movement of sugar from alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) to dodder (Cuscuta sp.) was noted in all experiments, while autoradiograms indicated little or no movement from the parasite to the host. Even when metabolic activities in the host were limited, dodder continued to withdraw sugars from the host.
10.2307/4041126|Internal dormancy (the state of internally arrested growth) in western ironweed (Vernonia baldwini Torr.) buds consisted of a recurring annual cycle of high and low activity with transition periods. Trends in sprouting activity were similar regardless of whether activity was measured by sprouting of buds following removal of stems in the field, or by sprouting of rhizome section buds in moist sand. Bud activity measurement was quantitatively different by the two methods, however, and the apparent period when internal dormancy developed also differed. A number of interdependent factors modified activity. At various points in the cycle, the stem apex inhibited bud growth; the stem alone inhibited bud growth; a transient block due to immaturity occurred in some buds; and two temperature-related blocks occurred. Bud age and location on the rhizome had little effect on activity. During the period of internal dormancy, sprouting of buds apparently stimulated activity of adjacent buds. Temperature greatly affected expression of internal dormancy; prolonged moist cold treatment eliminated it.
10.2307/4041136| The specific and general postemergence herbicidal properties of N-4-(4-chlorophenoxy)phenyl-N,N-dimethylurea [chloroxuron] were influenced by formulation and the carrier employed. 
10.2307/4041122|Imopea purpurea (L.) Roth and I. hederacea (L.) Jacq. significantly and equally reduced soybean yields and plant height, and increased lodging and the difficulty of harvesting. Damage to soybeans increased as the population of morningglories increased. Control of morningglories was needed for 6 to 8 weeks from the date of soybean planting. Morningglories germinated throughout the season and emerged from a depth of 6 inches below the soil surface.
10.2307/4041111|A hypothesis that low temperature acts directly on physiological development of coast fiddleneck (Amsinckia intermedia Fisch. and Mey.) by restricting thiamin content, and limiting growth, was investigated. Restoration of normal growth by application of thiamin, made the plant more susceptible to 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) at low temperatures.
10.2307/4041117|Ethyl N,N-dipropylthiolcarbamate [EPTC] inhibited the deposition of external foliage wax of cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata, L.). Wax inhibition was correlated directly with the rate of application of EPTC. Differential inhibition of wax deposition showed that foliage waxes were important in inhibiting the penetration and absorption of the alkanolamine salts of 4,6-dinitro-o-sec-butylphenol [DNBP]. Several other thiolcarbamates also altered the susceptibility of treated plants to subsequently applied herbicides. When EPTC was applied as a spray, only leaves then in the bud were affected. Leaf primordia developed later were not affected. Granular applications of EPTC extended the period during which the formation of foliage wax was inhibited. The reduction of foliage wax resulted in increased spray retention and decreased contact angle of spray droplets. EPTC increased the transpiration rate proportionally to its rate of application.
10.2307/4041133|A simple, inexpensive soil perfusion unit for use in studying the microbial decomposition of pesticides is described. This unit has the advantage of being equally adaptable to positive or negative pressure systems.
10.2307/4041120| When 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid-1-C (silvex) was applied to Opuntia polyacantha Haw. (prickly pear), pad absorption, root absorption, and translocation were low. The rate of translocation, as measured by acid fuchsin movement, was one cm per hour, about one tenth that found in soybean. Increasing the temperature from 21 to 32 C only slightly increased root absorption and upward translocation of silvex. Pre-treatment of a prickly pear pad, either with a 4% 2,2-dichloropropionic acid solution or mechanical removal of the cuticle, increased the absorption and translocation of subsequently applied silvex. The decarboxylation of silvex was 2 to 3 times greater in soybean than in prickly pear plants. Sixteen days after silvex was applied to prickly pear, four C-metabolites were found in addition to unaltered silvex. 
10.2307/4041132|Aspergillus niger v. T. ATC6275, proliferation was reduced by 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) at 10 and 50 ppm. Picloram (4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid) at rates up to 50 ppm did not reduce fungus growth. A. niger degraded both 2,4-D and picloram, 2,4-D more effectively. Both herbicides were contained in the fungus mycellium.
10.2307/4041125|Opuntia laevis or O. polyacantha (prickly pear) plants exhibited little water loss, exceptional viability, low nutrient requirements for growth, slight photosynthetic activity, slow translocation, and low transpiration rate as compared with corn or soybean plants. The limited number of stomata, thick wax cuticle, and high water binding ability of cell mucilage in prickly pear are largely responsible for the aforementioned physiological characteristics. These studies show that prickly pear pads, which are modified stems, are not efficient organs for metabolic activities. Water extracts of prickly pear tissue applied to corn seeds were found to induce pronounced growth stimulation of corn seedlings.
10.2307/4041124| Carrot (Daucus carota L. var. Imperator) seeds were planted in soil treated with amiben-C at 3 and 6 lb/A. Plants were harvested after 69, 103, and 191 days, autoradiographed or analyzed for the radioactivity in the 80 percent ethanol soluble fraction and in the insoluble fraction. The highest concentration of radioactivity was on or near the surface of the roots, but some radioactivity was present throughout the leaves and roots. The concentration of radioactivity decreased with time both in the soluble fraction and insoluble fraction of the root; in contrast it decreased in the insoluble fraction and increased in the soluble fraction of the leaves. Disks of carrot root were placed in an aerated solution of amiben-C. After 6 days, only 18.7 percent of the amiben remained unaltered. About 4 percent of the radioactivity was released as CO; 64.3 percent was present in an unknown compound which may contain a sugar moiety; the remaining 11.8 percent was distributed among four additional unknown compounds. 
10.2307/4041114|The hypothesis that leaf injury from applications of fenuron (3-phenyl-1,1-dimethylurea) is a direct result of a lack of photosynthate did not explain the results of experiments with seedlings of shrub live oak (Quercus turbinella Greene) supplied with an acorn food reserve supplemented with glucose solution, and with seedlings whose acorns were excised or left attached to the seedlings. An alternate hypothesis is offered: acute leaf injury from phenylurea treatment is due to one or more components of the electron transport chain, between the chlorophyll b pigment system and the reduction of triphosphopyridine nucleotide, which are left in a toxic oxidized state as a result of the phenylurea block in the oxygen-liberating system. Evidence also favors the above interpretation rather than the idea that toxicity results from the accumulation of a toxic oxidized product on the oxygen-liberating pathway. Although leaf injury appears to be due to toxic components of the inhibited photosynthetic apparatus, the ultimate cause of death of the entire plant is starvation. Besides its effect on photosynthesis, fenuron at high concentrations also causes inhibition of root growth.
10.2307/4041135|Seven insecticides were applied separately and in combination with the herbicide propanil (3,4-dichloropropionanilide) to young rice. None of the insecticides applied alone caused leaf burn. Toxaphene and endrin, in combination with propanil, did not increase leaf burn over that which occurred from propanil alone. Malathion, phosphamidon, Guthion (O,O-dimethyl S-4-OxO-1,2,3-benzotriazin-3(4-H)-ylmethyl) phosphorodithioate and Dylox, (O,O-dimethyl 2,2,2-trichloro-1-hydroxyethyl phosphonate) in combination with propanil, increased leaf burn over that which occurred from propanil alone. In general, increased leaf burn resulted in decreased yields of rough rice.
10.2307/4041129| The relationship of atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine) and diuron [3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea] decomposition to microbial activity in two soils was determined. Microbial responses to temperature, added energy material, and time were measured by evolution of CO from herbicide-treated soil samples. Evaluation of herbicide decomposition was made by bioassay and radioassay. Herbicide inactivation was directly related to metabolism of soil organic carbon. Larger amounts of herbicide were inactivated per unit of soil carbon metabolized in Norfolk loamy sand than in Decatur clay loam. This was associated with less soil specific surface and consequently greater concentration of herbicide on soil particle surfaces in Norfolk compared to Decatur soil. Addition of microbial energy sources accelerated decomposition of atrazine and diuron in both soils. Herbicide decomposition was closely associated with repeated additions of energy material, indicating an incidental or nonpreferential involvement in microbial metabolism. Decomposition of atrazine doubled with each 10-degree rise in temperature from 10 to 30 C, paralleling the response of soil organic matter decomposition. Diuron decomposition approximately tripled with each 10-degree rise in temperature. 
10.2307/4041131| Cotton and grain sorghum were treated with directed paraquat (1,1-dimethyl-4,4-dipyridylium cation) sprays in the field. Tall cotton was less susceptible to the herbicide than smaller plants. Some cotton varieties showed greater susceptibility to paraquat than others. In general, fiber quality was not affected by paraquat at 1/8 and 1/4 lb/A, although there was some effect on the fiber coarseness of the more susceptible varieties. Increasing light intensity caused more leaf damage from cotton stem applications of paraquat. Directed paraquat applications invariably caused the outer sorghum leaf sheaths to show necrotic spots where treated. Treatments on 6-inch sorghum reduced yields, but plants treated when taller than 6 inches were not injured. Thirteen sorghum hybrid and open-pollinated varieties showed varying degrees of leaf and sheath burn due to paraquat treatments. 
10.2307/4041130|Where sugar beets followed the year after one year's use of 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine), the carryover, measured by beet response was correlated with the time, the method, and the rate of atrazine used, and the time of plow-down. Where beets were the second crop after an atrazine application, carryover was correlated with the rate of application only. Carryover was greatest following two consecutive years' use of atrazine. Sugar beets were more sensitive to atrazine than were soybeans, navy beans, or oats.
10.2307/4041118| Soil samples were taken from 32 commercial cotton fields of the mid-south which had been treated with one or more practical applications of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron) every year for the past 4 to 8 years. These samples showed no phytotoxic residues in laboratory and greenhouse studies conducted approximately one year after the last application. Cotton seed samples from eight of these fields were analyzed, and none contained a detectable residue of diuron or any of its breakdown products. Diuron degradation in soil under field conditions was demonstrated by isolation and identification of the intermediate breakdown products: 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methylurea, 1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)urea, and 3,4-dichloroaniline. 
10.2307/4041134|A knife injector was designed and tested for the application of ethyl-N,N-dipropylthiolcarbamate (EPTC). Performance was good and preliminary tests were encouraging for both preemergence and postemergence applications.
10.2307/4041127|We developed a technique for obtaining buds which were alike except for the state of dormancy, and measured aerobic respiration and enzyme activities in internally dormant, and active but non-growing, buds of western ironweed (Vernonia baldwini Torr.). In both types of buds respiratory quotient was centered at about 1.2, and slightly higher in the active buds. Respiration rate paralleled specific malic dehydrogenase activity; both were lower in dormant than in active buds. Specific peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase activities did not differ markedly in dormant and in active buds. Respiration rate and all enzyme specific activities increased markedly when active buds were permitted to grow.
10.2307/4041116| The initial and residual toxicities, after 13, 22, and 31 weeks, of dimethyl 2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalate (DCPA), 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron), 3-(hexahydro-4,7-methanoindan-5-yl)-1,1-dimethylurea (norea), 2,4-bis(isopropylamino)-6-methylmercapto-s-triazine (prometryne), and ,,-trifluoro-2,6-dinitro-N,N-dipropyl-p-toluidine (trifluralin) were determined in the greenhouse in four soil types by an oats bioassay. DCPA caused the least oat injury initially, and also after 13 weeks. None of the herbicides persisted in amounts toxic to oats for as long as 22 weeks when applied at concentrations approximately equivalent to field rates necessary for weed control. The residual toxicities of these same herbicides, after 22 weeks or longer, were also determined in Bosket silt loam collected from two depths in two preplanting subsurface and two preemergence surface field experiments by using oats, cotton and/or soybeans as bioassay indicators. Results from field applications at rates recommended for weed control in cotton confirmed that neither DCPA, diuron, norea, nor trifluralin persisted in amounts toxic to oats, soybeans, or cotton; however, prometryne residues were moderately toxic to oats and soybeans. Prometyrne residues from a 4 lb/A non-incorporated subsurface treatment were nearly twice as toxic to oats 25 weeks after application, as were residues from the same amount applied as a surface preemergence treatment. 
10.2307/4041113|Herbicides 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron); 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine); 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine); 2-methoxy-4,6-bis(isopropylamino-s-triazine (prometone); 2-chloro-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (propazine); and 2,4-bis(isopropylamino)-6-methylmercapto-s-triazine (prometryne) were studied in four soils. The behavior of monuron, propazine, atrazine, and simazine was similar in each soil, while prometryne and prometone exhibited greater interactions with the soils. Phytotoxicity and movement of the herbicides in soil were inversely related to extent of adsorption.
10.2307/4041112|Field dodder (Cuscuta campestris Yunck.) emerged as well in total darkness as in light, but seedlings did not twine about the host. Under the shade of alfalfa, dodder emerged normally, but attachment was reduced more than 90% and delayed 7 to 10 days. Attached dodder shaded by alfalfa did not develop its characteristic golden color, grew very slowly, and was delayed in maturity 3 to 4 weeks.
10.2307/4041119| Cotton plants were treated with 2,4-D-2-C- (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) applied with pentachlorophenol and arsenic acid. Seed kernels and regrowth leaves were extracted and various components of the extracts were applied to leaf surfaces and injected into the stems of cotton seedlings. Results indicated that 2,4-D itself and/or a metabolite of 2,4-D, were responsible for the persistence of the 2,4-D stimulus in cotton. 
10.2307/4041128|In the greenhouse, picloram (4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid) prevented germination of side-oats grama [Bouteloua curtipendula (Michx.) Torr.,] big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi Vitman), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and blue grama [Bouteloua gracillis (HBK) Lag.] when applied preemergence. When applied at 1.5 lb/A or more at the two-leaf stage in the greenhouse and field, picloram significantly reduced plant numbers of all species. Of the four species big bluestem appeared to be the most tolerant to picloram in the seedling stages. Germination was reduced when 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) was applied preemergence to side-oats grama and the plant numbers of this species and switchgrass were reduced when treated at the two-leaf stage. The application of picloram to established native range did not reduce forage production or desirable plant frequency. All treatments reduced forb production. Picloram gave very good control of western yarrow (Achillea lanulosa nutt.), white heath aster (Aster ericoides L. nutt.), and western ironweed (Vernonia baldwini Torr.). White sage (Artemisia ludoviciana nutt.) was resistant to 4 lb/A of picloram.
10.2307/4041121|The phytotoxicity from preemergence applications of the herbicides 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine), 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron), isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate (CIPC), 2-chloroallyl diethyldithiocarbamate (CDEC) and 2-chloro-N,N-diallylacetamide (CDAA) was measured at 17 field locations in the coastal plain of North Carolina over three years. Site selections were made with specific regard for soil organic matter, which varied from 0.7 to 48.8 percent. Phytotoxicity responses determined at four to five weeks after treatment were the amounts of herbicide required to cause a 50 percent reduction in (1) soybean dry shoot weight, (2) cotton dry shoot weight and (3) number of weedy annual grasses. Fourteen factors were measured at each location to characterize soil, climatic and biotic factors, and correlated with plant responses obtained. For simazine, diuron and CIPC the factors measured accounted for 60 percent of the plant response variation. The highest simple correlation was usually between soil organic matter and plant response. Phytotoxicity of the aromatic herbicides was inversely correlated with soil organic matter level. CDAA and CDEC usually gave reliable and repeatable performance at constant rates on soils containing between 3 and 40 percent soil organic matter. Below 3 percent soil organic matter, extreme variation in CDAA and CDEC toxicity was encountered.
10.2307/4040971| Some factors affecting the absorption and translocation of radioactive 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) in blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica Muench.) were studied. Absorption of 2,4,5-T was less in plants treated late in the growing season than in those treated earlier. Absorption and translocation of 2,4,5-T were inversely related to soil moisture stress. Increases in the rate of application from 10 to 50 g of 2,4,5-T per plant caused a decrease in absorption and translocation, but decrease of the latter did not occur until the rate was increased above 25 g/plant. Translocation was highest in June and was higher from the leaves of mature plants than from young regrowth. 
10.2307/4040969|The herbicide 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile (dichlobenil) was quite persistent in cranberry bogs. The chemical was not readily leached downward in the soil nor carried from the bog by flood water but was recovered primarily in the upper 4 in of the soil. Chemical residue analysis demonstrated a greater quantity of herbicide was present than indicated by a bio-assay test. Most of the herbicide is believed to be held ineffective by the organic matter in the soil.
10.2307/4040968|The loss of 2-chloroallyl diethyldithiocarbamate (CDEC) from the dry surface of four soils was followed over a 24-hr period by spectrophotometric procedures. As the temperature was increased from 31 C to 44 C and to 54 C, average losses from all soils increased from 33 to 47 to 54%, respectively. There was relatively little difference in rates of loss from the different soils. Loss at 44 C at low (20%) and moderate (65%) relative humidity generally was similar in magnitude. Losses from a wet soil surface at 44 C were much more rapid than from a dry soil.
10.2307/4040977|Seeds of Striga asiatica (L.) Kuntze were induced to germinate with a stimulant from host exudates in the presence of a watersoluble germination inhibitor extracted from Striga seeds. Germination obtained was dependent upon the relative concentrations of stimulant and inhibitor present in the germination medium. The inhibitor had no effect on radical elongation of Striga seeds that germinated in its presence.
10.2307/4040979|A discussion is presented on some mechanisms whereby certain plant growth-regulating materials may exert their activity on plants. A discussion of photosynthesis is developed on the basis of two light reactions being involved in the photosynthetic process. Herbicides which may be active in photosynthesis are considered in relation to their site and mode of action. Current theories of nucleic acid metabolism and protein synthesis are presented and certain inhibitors of these processes are discussed and the possible involvement of plant growth-regulators is considered.
10.2307/4040966|Under light grazing, the reproductive capacity of wild carrot (Daucus carota L.) was reduced, but on pastures under heavy grazing, cattle prevented regrowth and seed production of flowering plants. To simulate the effects of cattle grazing, seedlings and flowering plants were clipped at different times during the summer on natural and experimental plots on different soil textures. Plants on fine textured soils were larger in size, regenerated more rapidly, and had a higher survival rate after clipping. The most efficient time for control by a clipping treatment, determined on the basis of prevention of seed production and mortality of plants, was in the latter part of August.
10.2307/4040978|The maleic hydrazide-30 treated plants increased in protein hydrolysate significantly over the controls, without having any growth. Therefore, this suggests that the synthesis of protein and metabolism of amino acids is not directly related to growth in tea (Camellia sinensis). The inhibitory effects may be due to the lack of synthesis of growth hormones responsible for cell enlargement, or may have a direct effect on the cell wall, reducing the cell plasticity. Hydrolysis with 6N HCl causes a significant destruction of amino acids.
10.2307/4040976|Most of the 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben) absorbed by treated plants was converted to N-glucosyl amiben in the roots. Only small amounts of amiben and N-glucosyl amiben occurred in stems and leaves. The N-glucoside was not metabolized further and remained in vegetative tissue of soybeans for at least 50 days. Soybeans which were depleted of carbohydrate reserves by starvation in the dark absorbed less amiben and produced less N-glucosyl amiben than did plants treated under normal illumination. A similar trend was noted for tomato plants treated in a comparable manner.
10.2307/4040972|Herbicides were evaluated for weed control in seedling perennial grass stands at six locations in eastern Washington. Most annual weeds commonly found in grass seed fields were controlled by 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (dicamba), 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA), and 1-butyl-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methylurea (neburon). Dicamba was the most effective herbicide for annual weed control but caused some injury to Kentucky bluegrass seedlings. Seedling grasses injured by dicamba recovered and became established in each trial. Grasses were injured about the same extent when treated with 2,3,6-TBA as when treated with dicamba, but 2,3,6-TBA did not control as many weed species. Neburon did not control as many species as dicamba and 2,3,6-TBA but was effective in killing a large number of species without measurable injury to grass seedlings.
10.2307/4040974|Gypsophila paniculata L., a dicotyledonous, herbaceous member of the Caryophyllaceae, was introduced into North America from Eurasia as a garden ornamental and has escaped to become troublesome in some areas. A life history study has revealed that this species is spread entirely by seed, its tumbleweed character being an important factor. Germination occurs mainly in the spring in Saskatchewan stands, perhaps as a result of no dormancy in the seeds. Although seedling development is characterized by a rapid penetration of the root system, mortality in natural stands is high. Under favorable conditions, at least 2 yr are required for the production of floral primordia. The mature plant is characterized by a root system which penetrates to depths of 4 meters or more. Shoots arise each year from a thick woody caudex.
10.2307/4040965|When vapor losses of isopropyl N-phenylcarbamate (IPC) and isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamate (CIPC) were studied under controlled laboratory conditions using a direct-trap for vapors, IPC proved more volatile than CIPC. Temperature, air-flow rate, moisture, and cation exchange capacity of soil were important factors influencing volatility. Vapor loss increased with increasing air-flow rate and temperature; losses from moist soil decreased as the percent day, organic matter, or both, and the exchange capacity increased. Vapor losses were negligible from spray applications on dry soil but were sizable from soils at field capacity which were similar to those from soils saturated with moisture. Vapor losses of IPC from granules were much higher than from a surface spray, and CIPC losses were about the same for the granules as from the spray. Covering the soil-applied herbicide with 1/8 to 1/4 in of soil was effective in reducing vapor loss.
10.2307/4040967|The role of corn (Zea mays L.) var. Dixie 18, sorghum (Sorghum vulgare) var. RS 610, and Johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense L.) in dissipation of 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) from Norfolk sandy loam was studied in the field and in a pot-culture experiment in the greenhouse. Atrazine residues were determined by both chemical and bio-assay methods. Corn and Johnsongrass field plots had significantly less atrazine remaining in the 0- to 6-in depth than similarly treated fallow plots 1, 2, 3, and 6 months after planting, and the crops were equally effective in dissipating atrazine from soil. Soil in pots cropped with corn, sorghum, or Johnsongrass had significantly less atrazine remaining than in uncropped pots. Uptake by corn, Johnsongrass, and sorghum within 3 months in the pot-culture experiment accounted for losses of approximately 25, 25, and 20%, respectively, of the herbicide initially present. Bio- and chemical assays were equally sensitive methods of determining atrazine in the soil and gave similar results.
10.2307/4040975|The herbicide 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben) was converted to N-(3-carboxy-2,5-dichlorophenyl)-glucosylamine, N-glucosyl amiben, in roots of plants treated with amiben. Identification of N-glucosyl amiben was accomplished by means of thin-layer and gas chromatography and confirmed by infrared spectroscopy. The postulated metabolite was synthesized and found to be identical with the product of amiben metabolism in plants.
10.2307/4040970|Barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crusgalli (L.) Beauv.) emerged in fields as early as May 3. The shortest period between seeding and emergence and between emergence and tillering was during the warmest period of the growing season. The number of days from emergence to heading and maturity decreased progressively for later seedings. The height of plants was greatest when the plants emerged early in the growing season. The highest number of tiller and heads per tiller were produced by plants emerging in July. Plants which emerged in May and June produced the highest yields. Barnyardgrass seedlings grown under 11-hr photoperiod and 16-hr photoperiod produced mature seeds in 52 and 84 days, respectively. Barnyardgrass grew best under wet soil moisture conditions.
10.2307/4040973|N-1-naphthylthalamic acid (NPA), 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben), and the dimethyl ester of 2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalic acid (DCPA), in granular and liquid or wettable powder formulations, were applied to the soil and then activated by either overhead or sub-irrigation. Granular formulations of the herbicides were as effective as liquid formulations for weed control, providing there was ample moisture for activation. High temperatures and dry soils were conducive to losses by volatilization of NPA. DCPA underwent less loss by volatilization at high temperatures. Both overhead and sub-irrigation were effective in activating these herbicides, but overhead generally was more effective. Under sub-irrigation, use of a granular carrier was more effective with a volatile herbicide. Formulation differences decreased in importance under overhead irrigation. Under conditions of high temperatures and soil moisture, soil persistence of the herbicides varied inversely with their volatility.
10.2307/4040939|Two propagules, axillary tubers of American pondweed and subterranean tubers of floating-leaf pondweed, previously undescribed, are reported. (Results for the first 4 yr of an 8 yr study of the yields of propagules certain aquatic plants grown are reported.) Single propagules of were planted April 1 in California or May 1 in Montana and harvested at the end of the growing season. Two types of propagules were studied, seeds and specialized asexual disseminules. (The latter included subterranean and axillary tubers, axillary buds, and stem segments.) The yields of seeds ranged from 0 with three species to over 2,000,000 with horned pondweed. One culture of sago pondweed formed over 36,000 subterranean tubers. Over 49,000 and 23,000 axillary propagules were produced by leafy and curlyleaf pondweeds, respectively. August, September, and October were the most productive months for the development of propagules. The period varied with each species.
10.2307/4040947|Effects of simazine (2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine) and atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine) were observed when applied in connection with 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole) to citrus trees. The amitrole had no significant effect. In heavy soil, atrazine toxicity to citrus trees was found during the summer following applications after a period of severe hot dry wind. The leaves became bronzed and dried, growth was checked, dry matter, chlorophyll, and catalase activity of leaves reduced, and their peroxidase activity increased when compared with controls from unsprayed plots; ascorbic acid content of leaves also was affected. Simazine, on the contrary, enhanced growth of trees, total and protein nitrogen and chlorophyll in leaves, did not affect peroxidase, catalase or ascorbic acid, and only slightly depressed dry matter content. In a light soil, probably due to less residual triazines, no toxic effects were observed and untreated controls evinced less growth, lower chlorophyll and nitrogen content of leaves, and higher peroxidase activity than all triazine treatments.
10.2307/4040956|Although selectivity was low, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron) gave excellent preemergence weed control when castorbeans (Ricinus communis L.) were planted 2 or 3 in deep. Excellent weed control with little crop injury by 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben) was provided also and selectivity was not affected by depth of planting.
10.2307/4040957|Average monthly rooting of saltcedar (Tamarix pentandra Pall.) stem cuttings collected weekly for a year and planted on a mist-bed was 96-100% from early February through May and decreased to 77% in November. Accompanying shoot formation reached a concurrent maximum of 96-100%, with an October low of 10%. Bud dormancy of October-November cuttings was reduced by cold treatment, but June-July cuttings were not responsive. A rooting compound reduced shoot and root formation.
10.2307/4040959| The pre- and postemergence herbicidal activities and specifications of 16 substituted toluidines on eight species were determined at two application rates. CF-analogs were more active as preemergence treatments, and CH-analogs were more active as postemergence treatments. Preemergence toxicity to crops was decreased in the CF and CH series when the N-substituents contained more than six carbons. 
10.2307/4040938| Adsorption of 1-butyl-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methylurea (neburon), determined spectrophotometrically, varied considerably among representative soils of six Hawaiian great soil groups, ranging from 29% in Lualualei soil to 94% in Honouliuli soil. The adsorption of neburon was strongly correlated with organic matter and total soil nitrogen; other soil properties were not related. Initial and residual neburon phytotoxicity to oats in the greenhouse was dependent on total soil nitrogen, organic matter, and the degree of neburon adsorption. Based on ED values, neburon toxicity in soil types decreased in the following order: Lualualei, Wahiawa, Mahana, Paaloa, Waimanalo, Kapaa, and Honouliuli. Complete neburon inactivation was obtained in Honouliuli and Waimanalo soils within the 150-day duration of this experiment, and nearly complete inactivation in Mahana and Kapaa soils. 
10.2307/4040946| Foliar absorption of carboxyl-labeled 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) by mesquite [Prosopis juliflora var. glandulosa (Torr.) Cockerel] seedlings was continuous throughout a 72-hr period. Approximately 50% of the 2,4,5-T applied to a single leaf was absorbed when 5 to 100 g were applied. No significant differences were found in the amounts of 2,4,5-T absorbed at 70 and 85 F, but an increase occurred at 100 F after 72 hr. Only slight differences in absorption were found at different humidity levels. Translocation was primarily basipetal from the point of application at 70 F, both acropetal and basipetal at 85 F, and only a short distance acropetal at 100 F. The quantities of 2,4,5-T translocated into untreated tissues at 100 F were less than at 70 and 85 F. The highest concentrations of 2,4,5-T were found in tissues with highest soluble sugar concentrations. From 3 to 27% of the 2,4,5-T absorbed by mesquite leaves was subsequently detected in untreated stem, leaf, and root tissues. Approximately 80% of the 2,4,5-T absorbed by mesquite leaves was metabolized after 24 hr. Moving the seedlings to a different environment at the time of treatment increased the rate of 2,4,5-T metabolism. Metabolism of 2,4,5-T was completely inhibited at 50 F and a lower rate of metabolism was noted at 100 than at 70 and 85 F. No important differences in metabolism were found at different humidity levels. 
10.2307/4040943| The relationship between susceptibility of certain plant species to 4,6-dinitro-o-sec-butylphenol (DNBP) and their capacity to accumulate externally supplied P, and to form ATP in leaf disks was studied. A correlation was found between susceptibility of the species to DNBP and their capacity for P accumulation and ATP synthesis. Therefore, it was postulated that susceptibility depends upon the level of ATP in the tissues. 
10.2307/4040952|Crabgrass (Digitaria spp.) control by different herbicides in field experiments varied from 84 to 100%. These extremes were not significantly different. Greenhouse studies showed that increased moisture content in soils may increase the growth rate of crabgrass seedlings so that they may escape herbicidal injury. Effects of herbicides on root stunting were similar in both dry and wet soils, indicating immobility of the herbicides under these experimental conditions. Competition between mature bluegrass plants and crabgrass seedlings was an important determinant of effective crabgrass control with preemergence herbicides.
10.2307/4040941|A technique was developed for the bioassay in 48 to 84 hours of herbicides in soil or of herbicidal solutions applied to sand. Sorghum seedlings are grown against the lids of petri dishes which are filled with a moistened sand or soil medium. A modification of this technique allows the assessment of the relative importance of uptake by the root and the shoot of a range of herbicides incorporated in sand or soil. Ethyl N,N-dipropylthiolcarbamate (EPTC), 2,3-dichloroallyl N,N-diisopropylthiolcarbamate (diallate), 2-chloroallyl-N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate (CDEC), and possibly 2-chloro-N,N-diallylacetamide (CDAA) are dependent on uptake via the shoot prior to emergence for their characteristic toxic effects. Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate (CIPC), 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile (dichlobenil), and 2,6-dinitro-N,N-dipropyl-4-trifluoromethylaniline (trifluralin) can exert their action through direct uptake by the shoot, but root uptake appears to be much more effective. A number of other compounds appear to be ineffective when uptake is via the shoot from moistened sand.
10.2307/4040955|A microcoulometric gas chromatographic method with a sensitivity of 0.01 ppm is described for the analysis of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) in milk and forage. The method will analyze 2,4-D as the acid, ester, and bound form from a single sample. Results show the superiority of this method over previous procedures. The formation of 2,4-D ethyl ester from the butyl ester in forage is discussed.
10.2307/4040950|Sesbania (Sesbania exaltata (Raf.) Cory) in soybeans was effectively controlled with wax bars containing 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). Bars, 22 in long, were attached horizontally 3 in apart to a tractor-mounted boom and the height was adjusted for it to travel 2 to 3 in above crop plants. Six-pound bars, containing 1 lb of 2,4-D gave better control than bars containing less 2,4-D. Bars made of wax with a melting point of 170 F provided more economical control than bars with waxes of lower melting points. Rate application of wax increased with the size of the weeds treated and with reduced tractor speed. Treatments controlled sesbania without visible injury to soybeans.
10.2307/4040949|Addition of organic matter reduced the effectiveness of 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) to oats in Regina heavy clay soil. At high moisture levels, changes in the relative amounts of clay in the soil did not affect the toxicity of simazine. Toxicity of simazine decreased as the soil moisture level was reduced.
10.2307/4040948|Cotton seedlings emerged normally following applications of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron) before or after furrowing for the preplating irrigation, but 7 to 10 days after emergence stands were sometimes reduced when diuron was applied before furrowing. Stand reductions were most severe when cottonseed were planted at or above the layer of diuron-treated soil. Cotton varieties differed in tolerance to diuron. Preplanting applications controlled annual weeds until mid-season and treated cotton produced normal yields, except where stands were reduced. Fiber properties and boll components of treated cotton were not altered. Content of diuron was highest in young cotton plants. No diuron was found in cottonseed at harvest using an analytical procedure having a sensitivity of 0.1 ppm.
10.2307/4040945| The compounds 3-(p-chlorophenyl-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron), 5-bromo-3-sec-butyl-6-methyluracil (bromacil), 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine), 2-chloro-4,6-bis (ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine), 1,1-dimethyl-4,4-dipyridylium salt (paraquat), and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole) were added to a complete nutrient medium on which chlorotic Nicotiana tobacum was grown in the dark. Herbicide concentrations generally were 0, 10, 10, 10, and 10 molar. Callus growth was inhibited by molar concentrations greater than 10 for the triazines, 10 for monuron, 10 for bromacil, 10 for paraquat and amitrole. At these concentrations, interference with a mechanism other than photosynthesis was responsible for inhibition of growth. 
10.2307/4040954|Low-volatile and high-volatile esters of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) were sprayed on separate pastures at about double the usual rate. Milk from cows grazing these pastures contained from 0.01 to 0.09 ppm 2,4-D during the first 2 days after spraying and lower amounts thereafter. Residues in milk from cows put into the pastures 4 days after spraying were below 0.01 ppm, the practical limit of precision of the method used. Residues of 2,4-D, in or on forage, declined rapidly during the experiment. Almost all the 2,4-D in or on forage was hydrolyzed to the acid form in samples of forage taken within one-half hour after spraying with the butyl ester of 2,4-D, and about 75% after applying the 2-ethylhexyl ester.
10.2307/4040960| Gross autoradiography showed that translocation of C-labeled 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole) from the leaf of quackgrass (Agropyron repens (L.) Beauv.) was retarded over 12 hr by ammonium thiocyanate applied as a spray or as a spot. While considerable export of C from the treated leaf occurred during 12, 24, and 96 hr after C-amitrole was applied, C-NHSCN as a tracer was largely restricted to the treated leaf over the first 24 hr and showed only slight export over 96 hr. It was concluded that the synergistic effect of NHSCN on amitrole is exerted in the treated areas and not at the ultimate site of amitrole action. 
10.2307/4040940|A Whirljet nozzle and a flat, fan-type nozzle produced similar spray patterns when used for aerial spraying so that no reduction in drift could be obtained by the use of either nozzle. Wind speeds of 3 to 4 mph caused drift more than 80 ft to the leeward of the flight line with both nozzles.
10.2307/4040951|The ultraviolet absorption spectra of aqueous dispersions of 2-chloroallyl diethyldithiocarbamate (CDEC) were altered by relatively short periods of exposure to far ultraviolet radiation. Evidence of molecular decomposition also was obtained from solvent partitioning characteristics, gas chromatography, and bioassays. Ultraviolet irradiation of soil surfaces treated with the herbicide decreased its persistence, but no evidence of decomposition was obtained.
10.2307/4040953|A chromatographic procedure for detecting 4-amino-3,5,6-tricholorpicolinic acid (picloram) residue to a sensitivity of approximately 0.05 ppm in soils is described. Picloram is extracted from soil as the free acid and methylated with boron trifluridemethanol reagent. Data indicate that the amount of herbicide which actually reaches the soil may only be 10% of that applied to dense stands of oak. Rainfall was an important factor in determining the movement and persistence of picloram. Picloram was detected to a depth of 24 in within 6 weeks after application. No detectable residues were found in the upper 24 in of soil after one year with rates as high as 8 lb/A.
10.2307/4040958| Propionate, 3-chloropropionate, and 2,2-dichloropropionate (dalapon) inhibited growth of Escherichia coli 99-4, a mutant organism incapable of growth in the absence of -ketopantoate. Growth inhibitions were circumvented by increasing the concentration of ketopantoate. Aliphatic acids (K salts) apparently inhibit biosynthesis of pantothenate at two metabolic sites-conversion of ketopantoate to pantoate and formation of pantothenate from pantoate. The latter inhibition has been reported previously. 
10.2307/4040944|In soil enrichment studies, the microbial degradation of 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon) was inhibited in the presence of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole), but dalapon had little or no effect on behavior of amitrole. Phytotoxic residues of the herbicides persisted longer in soils when the herbicides were applied in combination than when each was used individually. Although amitrole disappeared rapidly from all amitrole-treated soils, dalapon, when applied in combination with amitrole, disappeared more slowly than when used alone. Dalapon did not affect the behavior of amitrole in muck soil, but affected the availability of amitrole in Hagerstown silty clay loam treated with high rates of amitrole.
10.2307/4040937|Plots in dense quackgrass (Agropyron repens) sods were treated with 5-bromo-3-isopropyl-6-methyl uracil (isocil) or 5-bromo-3-sec-butyl-6-methyl uracil (bromacil) at rates of 0.5 to 4.0 lb/A in the fall or in the early spring and then planted to corn. Quackgrass was virtually eliminated by all rates but 0.5 lb/A. Corn was severely injured on plots treated at 2 lb/A but made fair growth at rates of 1.0 lb/A or less. The year following corn, soil residues of isocil were more toxic to oats than those of bromacil. Carbohydrate analyses of rhizomes from treated plots indicated that depletion of carbohydrate reserves contributed to the elimination of the quackgrass.
10.2307/4040942|In studies of the effect of root temperature on the toxicity of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) to rubber rabbit-brush (Chrysothamnus nauseosus (Pall.) Britton), 75 F resulted in the highest mortality following 2,4-D treatment. Root temperatures had no effect on leaf cuticle thickness. In similar studies with Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense (L) Scop.) and Russian knapweed (Centaurea repens L.), little injury resulted from 2,4-D treatment at 45 F whereas at 90 F in Canada thistle and at 60, 75, and 90 F in Russian knapweed, severe injury and/or death resulted.
10.2307/4040915| Detoxication of 3,6-dichloro-o-anisic acid (dicamba) in incubated soils was greater in heavier soil types and soils with higher moisture contents and higher temperatures. Dicamba phytotoxicity was less at 21 C than at 27 or 32 C. Over a pH range of 4.1 to 9.4, dicamba had a net negative charge. Dicamba showed considerable adsorption onto a kaolinite clay but little adsorption onto other clays and soils studied. Dicamba-1-C mixed with autoclaved Sharpsburg silty clay loam soil and incubated at 0, 33, 75, and 100% relative humidity and 35 C sustained very little volatilization loss over an 8-week period. However, nearly one-half of the radioactivity of dicamba-1-C on bare planchets at 0 and 100% relative humidity and 35 C was lost during an 11-week incubation period. 
10.2307/4040917|The loss of 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron) and 1-butyl-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methylurea (neburon) from an aquatic situation was studied. Appreciable loss of herbicides did not occur until 8 and 16 weeks after application of neburon and monuron, respectively. Periods of loss at an accelerated rate followed until approximately 50% of the herbicides disappeared. Further loss was observed but at a steadily decreasing rate. Approximately 15% of the monuron and 39% of the neburon remained after 128 weeks. More monuron was found in water than in soil during the first 32 weeks. After 32 weeks, most of the monuron was found in the soil and was largely in the top 4 in. The largest fraction of neburon was recovered from the soil and soil surface during all 128 weeks. Monuron moved down in the soil more readily than neburon.
10.2307/4040918| Among 12 of the more effective surfactants selected from a preliminary experiment, there were few differences in their ability to increase atrazine toxicity to large crabgrass [Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop.] and sorghum (Sorghum vulgare Pers.), or in toxicity to large crabgrass and sorghum when used alone. Surfactants per se showed some toxicity to large crabgrass and sorghum. As large crabgrass increased in size, it became less susceptible to injury from atrazine plus dodecyl ether of polyethylene glycol (Surfactant WK). Early spraying with atrazine plus Surfactant WK reduced the top-growth yield of six grass species. In field studies, atrazine alone and surfactants plus atrazine applied at the 1-in weed height gave very good early weed control. Field plots treated at the 4-in weed height generally produced more weed top-growth and less sorghum than plots treated at the 1-in height. Only the preemergence atrazine treatments gave weed yields that were equal to treatments that included handweeding. Sorghum injury from the surfactants was evidenced by reduced stover yields. Atrazine plus surfactant toxicity to emerged large crabgrass, grown in growth chambers, increased with higher relative humidities. This was not true for sorghum. The 1% surfactant mixtures generally had a lower surface tension than the 0.1% concentrations although the differences were not great. Surface tension was not the main factor governing the phytotoxicity of foliar-applied atrazine solutions. Translocation of atrazine from sorghum and large crabgrass leaves dipped in a C-ring-labeled atrazine solution was very slight or nonexistent. 
10.2307/4040924|Surface applications of 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram) were made at 5 rates on 3 soil types. The picloram-treated areas were sampled 3 times after herbicidal application to determine the extent and movement of herbicide residues. The region of highest picloram concentration in a heavy- and medium-textured soil, when sampled 9 and 15 months after application, was near the surface. On the light-textured soil, picloram moved more completely through the surface 2 ft of soil with greatest herbicide concentrations generally found at the deepest sampling depth. Applications of picloram were dissipated faster at low rather than at high rates on all 3 soil types. Concentrations of phytotoxic residues at the end of the study period were greatest in the heavy-textured soil with the highest organic content.
10.2307/4040934|In 1963 and 1964, a study was conducted near Bernardo, New Mexico, on control of saltcedar (Tamarix pentandra Pall.), comparing single and combination mowing and spraying with the propylene glycol butyl ether (PGBE) ester of 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy) propionic acid (silvex), repeated spray applications of silvex, and single applications of mixtures of silvex and 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram). None of the mow-spray combinations initiated in 1963 reduced the stand of saltcedar more than 8%, and there were no significant differences between treatments. A follow-up spray treatment of 4 lb/A of silvex in 1964 increased the plant kill up to 60%. Spraying undisturbed saltcedar in June, 1964, and re-spraying in August with 2 lb/A of silvex, reduced the saltcedar approximately 40%, as did a single application of a mixture of 2 lb/A of silvex and 2 lb/A of picloram in June.
10.2307/4040910|Dimethyl sulfoxide, soil-incorporated at rates of 20 to 240 gpa, prevented the growth of roots and delayed and inhibited the growth of shoots of plants developing from purple nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus L.) tubers for a period of about two months. This effect upon growth occurred only while the tubers and developing plants remained in treated soil; transplanted to untreated soil, subsequent growth of roots and shoots was immediate and normal. The effective soil-residual life of dimethyl sulfoxide was about three months, irrespective of dosage. Dosages of 2 1/2 to 7 1/2 gpa had no effect upon the growth of the nutsedge plants. At 10 and 15 gpa, the inhibitory effect of dimethyl sulfoxide becomes apparent.
10.2307/4040933|The effectiveness of catch or trap crops in ridding soil of witchweed was studied by growing the crops 1 through 5 years on heavily infested witchweed land. Catch or trap crops were about equal in value for witchweed eradication. Soybeans, field peas, and sorghum were grown 3 years before acceptable corn yields were obtained. Two years of millet and 4 of corn were required to obtain acceptable corn yields. Complete eradication of witchweed was not achieved by any crop during the 5-year period.
10.2307/4040911| Following root application of a selective rate of 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid-C (amiben-C), the translocation of radioactivity from roots to shoots was greater in pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), a susceptible plant, than in soybeans, a resistant one. Most of the radioactivity extracted from soybean and pigweed plants was present as conjugates of amiben-C. The conjugate extracted from soybean was chromatographically identical with an N-glycoside prepared from glucose and amiben. In soybean plants, 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid also was converted to N-glycosylamiben. 
10.2307/4040929|The relative tolerance of one-year-old peach and apricot seedlings to 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) and 2-methoxy-4,6-bis = (isopropylamino)-s-triazine prometryne was established by soil surface and soil incorporated applications. In all cases, the relative tolerance to both herbicides was greater for peach than apricot. Reciprocal grafts of peach and apricot budded seedlings indicated that the rootstock did not alter the tolerance. The greater tolerance of peach over that of apricot was attributed to physiological detoxification occurring in the scion.
10.2307/4040908|Foliar applications of the dimethylamine salt of 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)butyric acid (2,4-DB) were effective for controlling cocklebur in soybeans. Treatments usually caused crop injury, but treated soybeans often produced higher seed yields than untreated soybeans heavily infested with cocklebur plants. Soybean injury was associated with the mechanical shielding of soybeans by the cocklebur infestation and soil moisture stress at time of treatment. Droughty conditions prior to treatment intensified crop injury and reduced soybeans yields.
10.2307/4040925| Two-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine), 5-bromo-3-sec-butyl-6-methyluracil (bromacil), and 6,7-dihydrodipyrido-(1,2-a:2,1-c)-pyrazidiinium salt (diquat) significantly inhibited photosynthetic CO-fixation to varying degrees in corn (Zea mays L., var. Dixie 18), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L., var. Deltapine), and soybeans (Glycine max (L.) Merr., var. Lee). Atrazine treatments of 10 ppm overloaded the protective mechanisms in corn and cotton. Both 1 and 10 ppm of atrazine reduced CO-fixation to less than 5% of controls in soybeans, a sensitive species. One ppm of bromacil and of diquat reduced CO-fixation in all three crops, but diquat was less inhibitory than either bromacil or atrazine. Except for diquat on corn, herbicides had no significant effect on CO-fixation in the dark. Treatments in which photosynthetic CO-fixation was 5% or more of controls had little effect on the kinds or relative amounts of C-labeled compounds produced. Only the total amount fixed was reduced. Treatments, in which photosynthetic CO-fixation was less than 5% of controls, caused a significant reduction in the relative amounts of sucrose and alanine produced; however, the relative amounts of malic, aspartic, and glutamic acids increased. 
10.2307/4040926|In the greenhouse, 20% granular isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate (CIPC) at 6 lb/A provided 100% dodder control for 3 to 6 weeks. In the field, 95 to 100% control persisted beyond the expected soil life of CIPC because shade from the crop plants inhibited dodder development and dry soil reduced dodder germination. Effective control required uniform distribution on the soil before the dodder was wrapped on the host plant. CIPC was most effective when applied on the soil surface; incorporation 1/2, 1 1/2, or 3 in deep reduced its effectiveness. It controlled dodder well if applied to moist soil but was less effective when the soil surface was dry. Partial shade from the crop at the time of application increased the effectiveness of CIPC. Under certain undefined conditions, CIPC applied to the soil injured attached dodder. However, it was consistently effective only on dodder seedlings before attachment.
10.2307/4040913|Non-lethal dosages of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), which stunted pigweed plants, markedly reduced transpiration. Lethal dosages of 2,4-D, 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon), or toxic oil reduced transpiration rapidly, but transpiration continued until treated plants were air dry. Large plants died slower than small plants after herbicide treatment; consequently, they transpired more water before death.
10.2307/4040923| New Line Early Perfection peas (Pisum sativum L.) in the 10th-node stage were treated with a foliar broadcast application of 1 lb/A of the sodium salt of carboxyl carbon-14 labeled 4-(2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxy) butyric acid (MCPB*). Direct counting of C indicated that MCPB* equivalent to 8.4 ppm on the fresh weight basis was in or on the pea tissue immediately after treatment. The concentration declined rapidly for 6 days following treatment and then at a reduced rate until shelled pea harvest 5 weeks later. Translocation of C was studied by autoradiography. Most of the labeled material was retained at the application site. Very little was translocated to the new growth or into the pea seed. The plants retained C equivalent to 0.4 ppm MCPB* at the time of harvest with a concentration in the shelled peas of not more than 0.1 ppm. 
10.2307/4040914|The response of four growth stages of Setaria glauca (L.) Beauv. (yellow foxtail), Eleusine indica (L.) Gaertn. (goosegrass), and Dactyloctenium aegyptium (L.) Richt (crowfootgrass) to dimethylarsinic acid (cacodylic acid) applied at rates of 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 lb/A was studied. The four growth stages for chemical treatments were generally: (a) early tillering, (b) late tillering, (c) boot, and (d) post-heading. Seed production was reduced by as much as 96% in yellow foxtail, 80% in goosegrass, and 37% in crowfootgrass. Application of the chemical at the "boot" stage was most effective although earlier applications also were effective. Inflorescences often were malformed. Other growth effects suggested a growth regulator type activity.
10.2307/4040909|Applications of disodium methanearsonate (DSMA) killed Johnsongrass foliage in field and greenhouse experiments. Control of regrowth following treatment increased with increasing rates, but there was no indication of translocation to rhizomes. DSMA toxicity did not change in 20 to 80 gpa water, but somewhat less control was obtained in 10 gpa. Addition of a surfactant to spray solutions increased toxicity. Control was not affected by stage of Johnsongrass growth, but observations indicated increased control during droughty conditions. Repeated usage provided seasonal Johnsongrass control equal to that obtained with sodium 2,2-dichloropropionate (dalapon), although more frequent applications were necessary.
10.2307/4040928|Tubers of sago pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus L.) were grown at 72 F in a 14-hr photoperiod under 400 ft-c of cool-white fluorescent illumination. Plants were randomly harvested each day for 30 days, the organs individually weighed, and carbohydrate determinations made on selected tissues. Unsprouted tubers averaged 19.5% dry weight of which 74% was carbohydrate, predominantly in non-extractable form. During growth, the carbohydrate supply in the tubers decreased logarithmically by 1/2 each 4.93 days. Shoots began to grow logarithmically at 11 days, doubling in dry weight each 4.5 days. After 18 days, the carbohydrate content of the main shoot increased logarithmically, doubling each 7.35 days. Plants produced from average tubers increased 7-fold in dry weight in 30 days. Growth analysis showed that no shoots became self-sufficient before 16 days. Deduced patterns of carbohydrate flow are correlated with reports of herbicidal effectiveness.
10.2307/4040931|Mathematical relationships are developed for a general system in which the concentrate chamber and diluent vessel contain the active material to be evaluated. The use of the system for increasing the effective half-dosage distance is illustrated. A technique is described for decreasing the half-dosage distance with a conventional system.
10.2307/4040932|Using previously published data, a quantitative treatment of the influence of soil moisture content on herbicidal activity has been described. The treatment is based upon the use of the distribution coefficient,
10.2307/4040922| The effect of ultraviolet (UV) light (240-260 m range) on 6, 7-dihydrodipyrido (1, 2-a:2,1-c)-pyrazidiinium salt (diquat) and 1,1-dimethyl-4,4-bipyridinium salt (paraquat) was studied. Both dipyridyls were very stable in dark but were altered rapidly in the presence of UV light. Radioassay data collected from planchets containing solidified diquat or paraquat indicated a loss of more than 50% of the C from both compounds after 48 hr and more than 75% after 96 hr. When radioactive aqueous solutions were placed under UV lights, little change in the radioactivity occurred during an 8-day period as determined by liquid scintillation. When the concentration of diquat or paraquat in these solutions was determined by chemical analysis, degradation of the original molecules was observed. Information obtained by autoradiography of chromatograms, spotted with radioactive aqueous solutions exposed to UV light, indicated that two or possibly more C-containing degradation products were formed from both diquat and paraquat. Co-chromatography indicated that one degradation product from paraquat was 1-methyl-4-carboxy-pyridinium ion. 
10.2307/4040927| A study was made with glucose-l-C, glucose-6-C, and glucose U-C to determine quantitatively the effects of 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon) on glucose utilization in roots and shoots of one-week-old barley seedlings. An attempt also was made to determine the major pathway of glucose metabolism involved. Dalapon apparently did not change the normal pathway of glucose metabolism but interferred with glucose utilization as evidenced by differences in radioactivity of sugars and organic acids. Partial blocks may be operative initially at the beginning of the glycolytic pathway and subsequently in the Krebs cycle. 
10.2307/4040916|Glasshouse and field experiments were conducted on fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, and clay to study under high temperatures 2-chloroallyl diethyldithiocarbamate (CDEC) and ethyl N,N-dipropylthiolcarbamate (EPTC) incorporated with the surface 1/2, 1, 2, and 3 in of soil and unincorporated. Herbicides, sprayed on the soil surface, were incorporated either manually in the glasshouse or with a powered, rotary tiller in the field. The principal weed species were Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. Wats.), redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), junglerice (Echinochloa colonum (L.) Link), and barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crusgalli (L.) Beauv.). Performances of herbicides were determined by counting the plants 2 weeks after treatment. The herbicidal performance of CDEC was greater when the applications were incorporated with the surface 1/2 or 1 in whereas the performance of EPTC increased with increasing depths of incorporation up to 3 in. Soil temperature, soil moisture losses, and the distribution of herbicide in soil apparently contributed to differential herbicide performance.
10.2307/4040920|Plots infested with quackgrass (Agropyron repens (L.) Beauv.) were treated with 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropyl-s-triazine (atrazine) at several rates at various times and subjected to a number of cultural and cropping treatments. Depletion of carbohydrate reserves in the rhizomes increased with time after treatment. Recovery of the quackgrass occurred after 2 lb/A but usually not after 4 lb/A applications. Applications of nitrogen increased the rate of carbohydrate depletion. Two applications of atrazine at reduced rates were equal or superior to a single heavy rate. Tillage after treatment and crop competition improved the control of quackgrass obtained.
10.2307/4040919|The tolerances of wheat and wild buckwheat (Polygonum convolvulus) to various rates of 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (dicamba) were determined under field conditions and supplemented by studies with wheat in the growth chamber. Wheat height and yield were inversely proportional to rate, but response to various rates was dependent on stage of growth at application. Greatest reductions in wheat height and yield resulted from treatment at the late tiller and boot stages, respectively. The weight per 100 wheat seeds was increased from treatment at the boot and flower stages but was decreased at the early tiller stage. The ratio of peduncle length:length of the flag leaf-sheath was decreased most from 24 oz/A applied preemergence and 12 oz/A applied at the late tiller stage. Growth rate of wheat was decreased for a 2-week period after treatment. Excellent kill of wild buckwheat was observed from all rates applied through the 12- to 15-leaf stage of growth.
10.2307/4040921|The adsorption and desorption of 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropyl-amino-s-triazine (atrazine) as affected by pH, temperature, and cencentration of atrazine were studied on Drummer clay loam soil and a humic acid isolated from Leonardite. The adsorption of atrazine on the soil increased as pH decreased, but it was affected only slightly by temperature and cencentration of atrazine. Desorption of atrazine was greater with increasing temperature and pH. The adsorption of atrazine on the soil was reversible and desorption was nearly complete. Adsorption of atrazine on the humic acid increased as pH decreased and temperature increased, and there was very little desorption of atrazine from the humic acid.
10.2307/4040930|A low-volume, transparent, acrylic plastic concentrate tank for herbicide spray solutions is described which includes a fast-opening filler valve, a pressure relief valve, and a compressed air intake.
10.2307/4040912|Germination of wild carrot (Daucus carota L.) was not confined to any season but was correlated with abundant soil moisture in field studies. In laboratory studies, germination percentage for any seed lot increased with time as dormancy was overcome. Further, the germination was not clearly correlated with seed weight, light, or pH, but temperature and the availability of water were clearly significant. Dormancy was due to the endosperm which surrounds the embryo. When part of the endosperm covering the tip of the radicle was digested or broken off, germination was increased nearly to the potential for a given lot of seed.
10.2307/4041059|Two morphological types of tubers of yellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus L.) were collected over a 2-year period and were sprouted in the laboratory. Tuber dormancy occurred during late summer and early fall. Sprouting was highest during the winter and spring. Mechanical disturbance of the nutsedge stand increased tuber sprouting. Available carbohydrates followed a pattern similar to sprouting; minimum levels were found during late summer. The two types of tubers appeared to be similar in respect to the characteristics studied.
10.2307/4041061|Two fish from South America. (Metynnis roosevelti Eigenmann and Mylossoma argenteum E. Ahl.), both called silver dollar fish, grazed rapidly on several species of submersed aquatic weeds. Horned pondweed (Zannichellia palustris L.), American pondweed (Potamogeton nodosus Poir.), and sago pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus L.) were most palatable to the fish. Richardson pondweed (Potamogeton richardsonii (Ar. Benn.) Rydb.), curlyleaf pondweed (Potamogeton crispus L.), and American elodea (Elodea canadensis Michx.) also were grazed. The fish readily grazed on shoots of all sizes except those of mature plants. The Mylossoma grazed the plants more rapidly than the Metynnis. When water temperatures were above 70 F, the fish became more active in their feeding habits.
10.2307/4041055|Gas chromatographic and thermoelectric methods were combined in a quantitative study of absorption and movement of 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) in bean plants in various intensities of moisture stress. Foliar absorption of the herbicides studies was unaffected by extreme moisture stress. Herbicidal movement in the plant was markedly reduced, however. Distribution patterns were affected only when stress was permitted to progress to the wilting point. Picloram was more mobile than 2,4,5-T at all stresses.
10.2307/4041076|The herbicide 0-(2,4-dichlorophenyl) 0-methyl isopropylphosphoramidothioate (DMPA) applied either as a preemergence spray or in mixture with the alkanolamine salt of 4,6-dinitro-orthosec-butylphenol (DNBP) at the "ground-cracking" (emergent) stage increased the yield of peanuts from 1960 to 1965. Average yield increases from DMPA treatments for the 5-year period were highly significant statistically if DMPA treated peanuts were compared with peanuts either cultivated, handweeded, or sprayed with standard herbicide mixtures.
10.2307/4041078| Four new biodegradable alkylpolyoxyethylene glycol surfactants (15-S-9, DN-65, 15-S-3, and 15-S-3A) provided excellent visual wetting of corn foliage in spray solutions of 1,1-dimethyl-4,4-bipyridinium salt (paraquat), 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon), and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole) and many combinations were equal or superior to standard surfactants Tween 20, X-77, and Osamul 95 in enhancing phytotoxicity. Exceptions were observed, apparently due to specific but incompletely understood herbicide-surfactant-plant surface interactions. All four biodegradable surfactants and Osamul 95 were slightly toxic when sprayed alone on corn foliage. 
10.2307/4041060|Heights of corn and giant foxtail (Setaria faberii Hermm.) were measured during 1963, 1964, and 1965 in east-central Illinois to establish guidelines for postemergence control of this weed in corn. With an average planting date of May 9, corn grew to a height of 6 in and foxtail 2 in by May 28. With corn growing at a daily rate of 1 in and foxtail 1/2 in from June 5 to 20, foxtail height was 40 to 45% that of corn.
10.2307/4041067| Methods of weed control and seeding of perennial grasses on rangelands infested with downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.) in Nevada and northeastern California were compared for 4 years. In this study, 1, 1-dimethyl-4,4-bipyridinium salt (paraquat) at 0.5 lb/A and higher gave adequate and consistent control of downy brome for establishment of perennial grasses. Disking gave weed control and perennial grass establishment generally comparable to that of paraquat. Weed control from furrowing alone usually was not adequate for establishment of good stands. Seeding in furrows combined with paraquat spraying or disking gave best seedling establishment. Establishment of intermediate or pubescent wheatgrass (Agropyron intermedium (Host) Beauv. and A. trichophorum (Link) Richt.) was better than crested wheatgrass (A. desertorum (Fisch.) Schult.). Precipitation in different years, site potential, and weed population at different locations influenced weed control and establishment of perennial grasses. 
10.2307/4041057|The use of preplow foliar application of 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon) for two seasons, a pre-emergence soil incorporated treatment of ethyl N,N-dipropylthiocarbamate (EPTC) for three seasons, and tillage during all 3 years was effective in the control of Johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers.) while corn was being produced on the land. The use of tillage alone, dalapon plus tillage, or EPTC plus tillage resulted in neither satisfactory Johnsongrass control nor corn yield. Dalapon plus tillage reduced the rhizomatous Johnsongrass population and increased corn yield the season following preplow treatments; reinfestation occurred, however, from Johnsongrass seedlings that emerged in the row after the corn was planted. EPTC afforded early season control of seedling Johnsongrass. EPTC plus tillage did not satisfactorily control Johnsongrass or increase corn yield over tillage alone. Injury to corn planted 1 in deep was noted in the first season's treatments; however, corn planted 1 1/2 in deep in subsequent years was not affected.
10.2307/4041063|Methods of extraction, cleanup, and determination of 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) residues from soil were studied. Two-hr soxhlet extraction with methanol was more efficient than shaking extraction with methanol or other solvents. The most successful cleanup method was the use of grade IV basic alumina columns. Polyethylene coated alumina columns were useful if the soil extracts contained high amounts of pigments. A pyridine-alkali-ethylcyanoacetate method of determination was more sensitive and had better color stability than the pyridine-alkali method. Another advantage of the method with ethylcyanoacetate was that a pink chromophore was determined rather than a yellow chromophore which is subject to high interference from yellow pigments from soil extracts.
10.2307/4041072|Three facets of the phytotoxicity of disodium methanearsonate (DSMA) incorporated in soils were studied in seven greenhouse experiments. Growth of cotton planted immediately after incorporation of DSMA in Bosket silt loam was reduced significantly by herbicide concentrations of 50 to 80 ppmw. Toxicity appeared to decrease with time, particularly during the first 16 weeks after incorporation. DSMA incorporated in Bosket silt loam at 120 ppmw did not inhibit significantly the growth of cotton planted 32 weeks later. The addition of phosphorus to two silt loam soils increased the toxicity of DSMA to cotton. The incorporation of 50 ppmw of DSMA in Bosket silt loam inhibited rice growth by 75%, soybeans by 39%, oats by 12%, corn and cotton by 10%, and wheat by 0%. Rice growth was not affected in Dubbs silt loam or Sharkey clay by DSMA at concentrations as high as 100 ppmw.
10.2307/4041056|Purple nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus L.) was grown under greenhouse conditions as single tubers and various tuber chain systems. Single and repeated applications of amine methylarsonate were made to shoots of single tubers and shoots of terminal tubers in chain arrangements, and visual toxicity symptoms were noted in shoot growth both from treated tubers and from other tubers in chain arrangements. Arsenic (As) was translocated (as indicated by As content) laterally to tubers separated by at least four tubers from the treated shoot. The tuber on the opposite end of the chain from the treated shoot tended to be higher in As content than the middle tubers, and translocated As tended to be higher in tubers from which active growth was present or developed. No apparent relationship was found between As content of tubers and their ability to produce new shoots. There was some tendency for tubers to produce more than one shoot in the initial regrowth following treatment. Tuber lethality following repeated treatments evidently was due to depletion of food reserves and/or bud supply from increased sprouting and not to the accumulation of a specific level of As in the tuber.
10.2307/4041054| Water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes L.) was susceptible to applications of 6,7-dihydrodipyrido(1,2-a:2,1-c)pyrazidiinium salt (diquat). The most satisfactory rates of application were 1.0 to 1.5 lb/A of diquat. The addition of a surfactant did not increase the effectiveness of diquat. Several other chemicals gave unsatisfactory control of water lettuce. 
10.2307/4041062| The quantities of chloroplast proteins and chlorophyll were lower in oat plants treated 6 days with 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) than in the controls. Radioactive amino acid incorporation into chloroplasts indicated that the reduced levels of protein resulted from reduced synthesis. Glucose improved the amino acid incorporation in the treated tissue, but still the rate was reduced markedly by the simazine treatment. An effect of simazine even in darkness on amino acid incorporation into chloroplasts was suggested by the data. Total ribonucleic acid (RNA) content and synthesis as measured by incorporation of p were altered by simazine treatments. 
10.2307/4041066|Studies conducted near Bernardo, New Mexico, from 1962 to 1964 involved the influence of environment on weekly shoot growth and carbohydrate storage in roots and stems of undisturbed saltcedar (Tamarix pentandra Pall.) and of regrowth (plants regrown from having been mowed the previous winter). Environmental variables wee air and soil temperatures, relative humidity, wind, solar radiation, barometric pressure, evaporation from a free-water surface, depth to water table, and water quality. No variable or combination of variables could be used to predict accurately the maximum shoot growth period or the minimum carbohydrate storage. An analysis of the individual weekly growth patterns of plants showed considerable week-to-week variation in the rate of growth. Wide variations in total carbohydrate storage in roots and stems within weeks also were evident, and probably reflected the variation in growth.
10.2307/4041064|The control of vegetation along fence lines was studied using 1,2-dihydropyridazine-3,6-dione (MH) at rates of 0, 8, 10, and 12 lb/A. MH reduced plant height, did not change the number of leaves, decreased number of seed stalks, increased the number of discolored leaves, and decreased the uneven appearance. The leaf discoloration was linearly related to the application rates. Observations on species' susceptibility showed a considerable interspecies variability to MH effects. MH at 10 lb/A applied in narrow bands was effective in decreasing maintenance work along fence lines without reducing the protective cover.
10.2307/4041068|Histological abnormalities were found in Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.) roots after plants received foliar treatments of 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram). These abnormalities included destruction and distortion of cortical cells and cambial and phloem disintegration. Some or all of these conditions were present, depending upon which portion of the root was sectioned.
10.2307/4041070|Foliar and soil herbicidal treatments were made on creosotebush (Larrea tridentata (DC.) Cov.), tarbush Flourensia cernua DC.), and whitethorn (Acacia constricta Benth.) near Tombstone, Arizona, from 1957 to 1964. All herbicides were most effective when applied approximately 30 days after initiation of the summer rainy season. The herbicides 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) were about equal in effectiveness, but the relative susceptibility of the individual shrubs to the herbicides varied with treatment conditions. The acetic form of 2,4,5-T generally was more effective than the propionic; propylene glycol butyl ether, iso-octyl, and tetrahydrofurfuryl esters more effective than pentyl. Foliar applications of 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram) were most effective on whitethorn, intermediate on creosotebush, and least effective on tarbush. The most effective soil herbicidal treatments were 3-phenyl-1,1-dimethylurea (fenuron) and 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron). In general, effective control of dominant Chihuahuan Desert shrubs required 2 to 4 lb/A of 2,4-D or 2,4,5-T, 1/4 to 1 lb/A of picloram, or 2 lb/A of fenuron or monuron.
10.2307/4041065| Rates of dissipation of 6,7-dihydrodipyrido [1,2-a:2,1-c] = pyrazidiinium salt (diquat) and 1,1dimethyl-4,4-dipyridinium salt (paraquat) in water were studied from 1963 to 1965 at Davis, California. Effects of several environmental factors on dissipation of the herbicides, and herbicidal control of 9 to 14 aquatic weeds and toxicity to three kinds of fish and an Asiatic clam also were investigated. Small amounts of the herbicides were still detectable in water at the end of 12 days. In reservoirs, diquat applied at 1000 ppbw or less dissipated to 9 ppbw or less. In growth pools, a concentration of 4000 ppbw dissipated to between 600 and 900 ppbw. Dissipation of paraquat in reservoirs was slower than diquat and exhibited unpredictable fluctuations in amounts present. When 250 to 2500 ppbw of paraquat were applied in reservoirs, 0 to 180 ppbw remained after 13 days. In growth pools, 80 to 300 ppbw of paraquat persisted on the 12th day after applications of 1000 to 3000 ppbw. 
10.2307/4041058| The responses of herbicides applied singly are used in calculating the "expected" response when they are combined. The expected response for a combination is obtained by taking the product of the percent-of-control values for herbicides applied alone and dividing by (100) where n is the number of herbicides in the combination. 
10.2307/4041069|In an attempt to improve the metering of herbicides applied to soil in horticultural plantings, loosely knitted cellulose acetate cloth was impregnated with herbicides, using appropriate acre rates as determined by those used in spray applications. Treated cloth was placed on the soil and the edges anchored or the cloth was lightly covered with soil. Adjacent plots were sprayed with the same herbicides. The herbicide-impregnated cloth was as effective as spray applications of 12 of the 15 herbicides used.
10.2307/4041074|Corn was grown in soils containing root residues of giant foxtail (Setaria faberii Herrm.), yellow foxtail (Setaria glauca (L.) Beauv.), and crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop.). The effect of these residues on corn root growth was studied using a new technique which measures root response to soil properties with a single plant. Giant foxtail was the most inhibitory. Implications of these data are discussed in terms of the dominance and competitive ability of giant foxtail.
10.2307/4041071| Measurements were made of plant toxicity and of several physical and chemical properties of spray solutions containing 1,1-dimethyl-4, 4-bipyridinium salt (paraquat) and either anionic, nonionic, or cationic surfactants. Surface tension and pH values were variable among 10 surfactant-paraquat mixtures and also at 0.1 and 1.0% surfactant concentrations, but neither showed any correlation with herbicidal activity on corn when all surfactants were considered. All four nonionic, both cationic, and two out of four anionic surfactants markedly enhanced paraquat toxicity at appropriate concentrations. Studies of UV absorbance of herbicide and surfactant solutions, alone and in combination, and adsorption of paraquat-C at solution-air interfaces indicate that significant interactions occurred between paraquat and the anionic surfactants. Foliar toxicity studies offered substantiating evidence of such interactions; however, the degree or lack of enhancement of paraquat toxicity was strongly influenced by plant species (corn vs. bean) and the type and concentration of surfactant. No surfactant-paraquat combinations studied were less effective than 1/8 oz/A of paraquat used alone. 
10.2307/4041079|A laboratory sprayer, designed to make herbicide applications to potted plants and to study spray distribution patterns with different nozzles, is described. An activated charcoal air filter was installed to minimize herbicide contamination to adjoining greenhouse-laboratory facilities during the spraying operation.
10.2307/4041073|High concentrations of arsenic (As) may be expected on Coastal bermudagrass forage harvested soon after application of organic arsenicals for weed control. Stage of plant development at treatment, rainfall between treatment and harvest, rate of application of arsenical herbicides, and the amount of growth between treatment and harvest are factors influencing As residue levels in harvested material. Regrowth following removal of treated growth had a lower As concentration. Treatment application on short grass and removing and discarding the treated foliage appeared to be the most effective means of reducing As residues.
10.2307/4041077|The U.S. Department of Agriculture World Collection of Flax Germ Plasm was screened for resistance to 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine). A single plant selection of CI 719 was the most resistant. It produced dry matter equaling 33% of the control in soil treated with atrazine at 1 lb/A while Arny produced 10%. In another experiment, the selection of CI 719 produced 44% as compared to only 11% for Koto. The atrazine-resistant selection was not resistant to 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine [simazine]. Seed of this selection of CI 719 have been entered in the World Collection and assigned the number CI 2484.
10.2307/4041075|Five rates of 1-(2 methylcyclohexyl)-3-phenylurea (siduron) were applied to Cohansey and IaGreen cultivars of creeping bentgrass (Agrostis palustris). Siduron had no effect upon leaf respiration or photosynthesis of either cultivar. Cohansey was tolerant to 100 lb/A of siduron while top growth of IaGreen was reduced 90% at 1.5 lb/A. Siduron inhibited new root growth of the IaGreen cultivar and decreased root respiration.
10.2307/4041053|A new technique designed for the study of various modes of weed competition has been developed and tested. It applies to almost all environmental conditions as they affect plant growth. The technique is adaptable to single factors and multiple factors in almost any combination. The only major restriction imposed by present dimensions is that only early competition can be studied. The uniformity of seed used in closely controlled competition studies is extremely important. Heavy seeds of redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.) produced plants that brought about earlier and more intense shading than plants from light redroot pigweed seed. Applying an aluminized Mylar reflective surface on the inside of the aerial portion of the competition box increased the growth rate and development of species and shortened the time interval for experiments by 10 days.
10.2307/4040996|Rush skeletonweed (Chondrilla juncea L.), a serious agricultural pest in Australia, is increasing in the western United States. Persistence in established areas is encouraged by the resprouting of all portions of the taproot and wind borne achenes. Invasion to new areas is reduced by short achene life, the germination pattern of young seedlings, and the lack of shade tolerance. Fall applied 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram) and 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (dicamba) were effective for chemical control of spot infestations.
10.2307/4041011|Herbicide-application equipment was combined with a sled tool-carrier to plant a test crop and apply a herbicide simultaneously to single rows as surface, subsurface, incorporated, and injected sprays. Results obtained, using the methyl ester of 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben), indicated the equipment can facilitate the evaluation of the influence of method of application on the activity of herbicides applied to soil.
10.2307/4041012|A new method for taking soil samples was devised. Vacuum is used to move the soil in an air stream from the sampling site into a sealed bag. Much of the hard, time-consuming work can be eliminated with this new method of sampling. No differences were noted in bioassay plants grown in samples of soil taken in the conventional manner, as compared to plants grown in samples taken with the vacuum device.
10.2307/4040993|Experiments were conducted to determine adsorption of methanearsonate by soils, soil separates, and reference clay minerals from solutions of disodium methanearsonate (DSMA), effects of soil type and pH on the leaching of surface-applied DSMA, and effects of soil type and added organic matter on the oxidation of the methyl carbon of methanearsonate. Adsorption of methanearsonate by kaolinite and vermiculite increased with increasing concentration of DSMA in the equilibrium solution. Kaolinite and limonite adsorbed much more methanearsonate than vermiculite and montmorillonite. The clay fraction of Augusta silt loam adsorbed more methanearsonate than did the sand and silt fractions. Adsorption by whole soils was related generally to their clay contents. Leaching with 20 successive 1-in increments of water removed 52% of surface-applied methanearsonate from Norfolk loamy sand. Rates of movement of DSMA in Norfolk loamy sand did not differ at three pH levels. About one-half of the applied methanearsonate remained in the surface inch of Decatur clay loam and none was leached below 6 in. Oxidation of the methyl carbon of methanearsonate was associated with oxidation of soil organic matter in each soil. In three of the soils, there was no evidence of microbiological adaptation to methanearsonate. In Norfolk loamy sand, however, increasing decomposition of methanearsonate relative to soil organic matter occurred with time of incubation. Decomposition of added plant material in this soil enhanced the oxidation of methanearsonate.
10.2307/4041006|Selective control of red sorrel (Rumex acetosella L.) in Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) seed fields was obtained with 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (dicamba), 7-oxabicyclo(2.2.1)-heptane-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (endothall), 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben), 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid (fenac), and 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA). Kentucky bluegrass seed yields and germination were not significantly reduced by application of any of the herbicides in the fall even though rates higher than necessary for red sorrel control were used. Application of dicamba in the spring at more than 1/2 lb/A reduced Kentucky bluegrass seed yields and germination. Endothall reduced seed yields when applied in the spring at 4 or 5 lb/A.
10.2307/4040997|This work is an endeavor to aid researchers located in remote areas as well as researchers who may have experienced difficulties in the regulation of controlled environment chambers. Descriptions of the maintenance and use of controlled environment chambers contained herein were compiled over an 8-year period of experience with four chambers. Although the physical characteristics of the controlled environment chambers described are dissimilar from many, the causes and remedies of malfunctions are general and typical of those found in many controlled environment chambers. Several protective devices for expensive equipment are described as well as several common malfunctions and their remedies.
10.2307/4040995|In field, soil culture, and nutrient culture experiments, 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) increased percent total nitrogen in all species studied, whether resistant, intermediate, or susceptible to 1 lb/A of atrazine. However, nitrogen content per plant was either unaffected or decreased by these atrazine treatments. One lb/A of atrazine increased percent protein and nitrate nitrogen in most species studied. Atrazine susceptibility apparently was related to its effect on percent non-protein and ammonia in the species tested. One lb/A of atrazine had no effect on percent non-protein nitrogen and decreased percent ammonia nitrogen in resistant species but increased both fractions in intermediate and susceptible species. One lb/A of 2-hydroxy-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (hereafter referred to as hydroxyatrazine), a degradation product of atrazine, had no consistent effect on any nitrogen fraction studied.
10.2307/4041014| A 0.25-mil mylar film was used as a part of an in-situ autoradiographic technique for studying C-labeled compounds in soil containing growing corn (Zea mays L., var. WF9  Hy) roots. This technique facilitates herbicide movement studies in soils and plants while plants grow undisturbed. 
10.2307/4041003| Uptake of phosphorus by red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) seedling roots from a medium containing .0015 ppm P was stimulated at 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) levels of 5 and 10 ppmw but inhibited at higher levels of 15 and 20 ppmw. Concentrations of simazine between 5 and 20 ppmw resulted in increased translocation of phosphorus from roots to stem and needles with increasing incubation time from 12 to 96 hr. Combinations of simazine at 10 ppmw with P at concentrations above 20 ppm resulted in decreased phosphorus uptake for incubation periods less than 72 hr. Phosphorus content of stems was not greatly influenced by simazine treatment or P concentration, but phosphorus content of needles was significantly higher in response to simazine. 
10.2307/4041008|The herbicide 5-amino-4-chloro-2-phenyl-3(2H)-pyridazinone (pyrazon) was selective for sugar beets (Beta vulgaris L.). In preemergence treatments, sugar beets tolerated pyrazon at rates up to 6 lb/A, but at this level some mortality occurred. On the other hand, some weed species were susceptible to levels as low as 2 lb/A. Between emergence and the cotyledon stage, both beets and weeds were quite susceptible and the phytotoxicity of pyrazon increased with increasing temperature. In the late cotyledon stage, beets were resistant to pyrazon in aqueous suspension and partially susceptible to an oil-water suspension. Beets in the two to four-leaf stage tolerated an oil-water herbicidal combination, while lambsquarters (Chenopodium albium L.) and redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.) remained susceptible up to the six to eight-leaf stage. Rape (Brassica napus L.) was of intermediate susceptibility. In general, preemergence treatments were the most promising but could be replaced by postemergence treatments of pyrazon in an oil-water emulsion.
10.2307/4041009| Astragalus miser Dougl., var. oblongifolius (Rydb.) Cronq. was analyzed for seasonal and physical distribution of its contained poison. Small chickens (Gallus domesticus, Arbor Acre  Vantress hybrids) and cattle (Bos taurus, Hereford) were used as test animals. The poisonous compound was extracted from dried plants with 95% ethanol, evaporated and redissolved in water, then semi-purified by several extractions with chloroform for toxicological studies. The poison was found primarily in the green leaves. The plants were very poisonous until they began drying in August. Once leaves became bleached at senescence, toxicity disappeared. Plants treated with the triethylamine salt of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) and the alkyl amine salts of 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)-propionic acid (silvex) were less poisonous to cattle than untreated plants. Acute poisoning in chickens was characterized by depression, accelerated heart action, followed by congestion of lungs, cardiac insufficiency, paralysis, and heart failure. Chronically poisoned birds exhibited the same syndrome but sustained more severe liver damage. 
10.2307/4040999| Experiments were conducted on black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) to determine the effect of auxin distribution and degradation on the formation of root suckers. Stump sprouting and root suckering occurred when black locust seedlings were decapitated, and the presence of stump sprouts prevented root suckering. The influence of stump sprouts could be replaced by applying indoleacetic acid (IAA) in lanolin paste to the cut surfaces of root stubs. These results provide additional support for an apical dominance theory of suckering. When IAA-2-C in lanolin was applied to the cut surfaces of root stubs, autoradiographs showed that C activity was concentrated where the majority of root suckers normally would develop. Apparently, IAA accumulated in this region and inhibited root suckering. When the IAA-lanolin paste was removed from the root stubs after inhibiting suckering for a month, vigorous root suckcring took place. This indicated the possibility that black locust roots contain an IAA oxidase system. The existence of such a system was demonstrated by dialyzed enzyme preparations extracted from black locust roots which oxidized IAA in a Warburg apparatus. 
10.2307/4041010|Soil surface applications of crabgrass (Digitaria spp.) herbicides prevented rooting of Bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon L., var. 328) from the stolon nodes. Inhibition of root development was confined to the areas of the stolon which were in direct contact with dimethyl 2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalate (DCPA). Placement of the herbicides at various soil depths reduced the number of roots developing below the treatment; however, normal root growth occurred above the treated layer. Under field conditions, certain crabgrass herbicides delayed normal rooting of Bermudagrass from nodes for 12 weeks. Established root systems were not appreciably altered by the herbicidal treatments.
10.2307/4041005|The anatomy of the first internodes of three different lengths of giant foxtail (Setaria faberii Herrm.) was studied in the seedling stage. Epidermis was non-cutinized throughout the entire length. Least cortical breakdown occurred in an area 1 cm below the coleoptilar node, regardless of the length of internode. Endodermis and pericycle were present throughout the internode length, but identity was lost at the coleoptilar node and above. The number of metaxylem and protoxylem elements decreased basipetally from the coleoptilar node. Adventitious root primordia, found in all first internodes, originated from the pericycle. The total number of primordia, at the growth stage studied, appears to be proportional to the length of the internode, with fewer primordia in the 1-cm sections below the coleoptilar node. The implications of root and shoot uptake are discussed in terms of the anatomy of the first internode.
10.2307/4041015|Encroachment of woody species reduces the productivity of sphagnum moss (Sphagnum sp.) in acid bogs. Leatherleaf (Chamaedaphne calyculata (L.) Moench) and black chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa (Michx.) Willd.) were major species of concern to moss harvesters. Black chokeberry was controlled by spray applications in spring of 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram) at 1 lb/A. Leatherleaf was controlled by either fall or spring applications of picloram at 1 lb/A. No control was obtained with eight other herbicides tested. Sphagnum moss carried phytotoxic residues three growing seasons after picloram application.
10.2307/4040994|Narrow bands of activated charcoal sprayed on the soil surface directly over the rows seeded with alfalfa (Medicago sativa L., var. Cayuga) in the field protected the legume from damage by a broadcast application of 2-isopropylamino-4-(3-methoxypropylamino)-6-methylthio-s-triazine (hereafter referred to as G-36393). Charcoal suspended in water and applied at 25 to 50 lb/A, gave adequate protection from 1.5 lb/A G-36393. Higher rates of charcoal, 100 lb/A, were necessary to protect the legume from a 3.0 lb/A application. Charcoal did not protect alfalfa seedlings from 1.5 lb/A 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine).
10.2307/4040998|Environmental and physical factors influencing the effectiveness of preemergence applications (4 lb/A) of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron) were evaluated under field conditions for 10 Hawaiian sugar cane (Saccharum officinarum L.) plantations. Rainfall, soil pH, organic composition, time lapse between field harvest and herbicide application, and maximum temperature had a significant effect on the resultant period of weed control. The data from 295 field tests conducted over a 10-year period then were subjected to multiple regression analysis. The prediction equation derived via these calculations was sufficiently accurate to justify its application to the Hawaiian sugar cane regions. The single most important factor adversely influencing the pre-emergence activity of diuron was the lapse of time between harvest and application, a factor within the control of the plantation personnel.
10.2307/4041001|Both direct and indirect effects of the environment, and the possible role of the crop in modifying the environment of the weeds, are considered. High humidities and high temperatures in general increase susceptibility, and temperature also may have important morphogenetic effects. Low light intensity before, and high intensity after, spraying appear to increase susceptibility. Light also may affect leaf morphogenesis. Soil condition also may affect susceptibility, particularly soil residues of certain herbicides, and crop competition may contribute to weed mortality. The relationship of stage of growth at spraying to susceptibility is also discussed.
10.2307/4041016|Soil dispersion in an aqueous solution of sodium hexametaphosphate and sodium bicarbonate facilitates extraction of seeds by flotation with megnesium sulphate. The percentage viability of seeds collected in this manner subsequently can be determined with 2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride. Extraction of seeds usually is 100% efficient and enumeration of viable seeds via the tetrazolium test is accomplished much more rapidly than with conventional methods.
10.2307/4041002|The effects of four densities of annual broadleaf weeds and annual grass weeds and an equal combination of the two on the yields of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) roots and tops, percent sucrose and total solids, average diameter of beet roots, and total plot yields were studied during 1964 and 1965. Broadleaf weeds were more competitive than annual grass weeds and the effects of an equal combination were intermediate. Without cultivation, all weed densities reduced the yield of beet roots below the weed-free plots. Twenty broadleaf weeds/sq ft were required to reduce yields when plots were cultivated and weeds were limited to a 10-in band over the beet row. The effects on the yield of beet tops, average root diameter, and total plot yield were similar to the effects on beet root yield. The components of total plot yield are examined. No weed density had a real effect on beet stand, percent total solids, or percent sucrose of the beet roots.
10.2307/4041004| The metabolism of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole) in bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L., var. Black Valentine) corn (Zea may L., var. Batam Cross), and sugar beet (Beta saccharifera L.) leaves was studied with both C and tritium-labeled amitrole. Insignificant amounts of C were recovered in the respired CO from plants given amitrole-5-C. The metabolic conversion of amitrole in leaves was exponential and can be expressed by an equation for a first order reaction. The half-time of amitrole in sugar beet, corn, and bean leaves were 18.7, 28.0, and 23.2 hr, respectively. Radioactivity from amitrole-5-C was found in extracts or nucleic acids, proteins, and other plant constituents. Largest amounts of radioactivity were recovered as alcohol soluble metabolites. Experiments with (amitrole-H) and (amitrole-5-C) showed the position of hydrogen substitution in each alcohol soluble metabolite. 
10.2307/4041013| The influence of pH and incubation time on the detoxication of 11 herbicides incorporated into high organic matter soils was investigated. Five of the chemicals were detoxified at different rates at the various pH levels. Optimum pH levels for the detoxication of these chemicals were (a) pH 5.3 for 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (dicamba) and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), (b) 6.5 for 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon) and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole), and (c) pH 7.5 for S-propyl dipropylthiocarbamate (vernolate). Slow positive detoxication, without pH influence, was observed for 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron) and 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben). No detectable detoxication was observed for 4-amino-2,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram), ,,,-trifluoro-2,6-dinitro-N,N-dipropyl-p-toluidine (trifluralin), 5-bromo-3-isopropyl-6-methyluracil (isocil), or 2-methoxy-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (prometone). 
10.2307/4041000|Spring and fall applications of 10 soil sterilant herbicides were investigated for control of brush and herbaceous vegetation at five locations in Texas. A majority of the herbicides controlled most brush species. However, 5-bromo-3-sec-butyl-6-methyluracil (bromacil), 2-methoxy-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (prometone), and 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram) were most effective at all locations. A mixture of disodium tetraborates, 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron) and trichlorobenzoic acid was very effective for at least 20 months at four of the five locations. Most herbicides controlled herbaceous vegetation for 1 year or less. Bromacil controlled herbaceous vegetation for approximately 2 years at most locations.
10.2307/4041007|Residues of 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid (fenac) and 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile (dichlobenil) were determined in irrigation water flowing over canal-bottom plots treated with the herbicides prior to the entry of water. Concentrations of fenac and dichlobenil in the first water to flow over the entire treated plots were 8.82 and 8.63 ppm, respectively. The bulk of the residues was transported from the plots in a very short time, and safe levels were reached after 1 hr of water flow. The dichlobenil burden, picked up by water as it flowed over the treated plot, was effectively reduced as the water passed over untreated canal soil downstream.
10.2307/4041185|Preliminary observations indicate that tobacco is extremely sensitive to 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram). This study was conducted to determine the effect of time and rate of treatment on tobacco yield, quality, dollars per acre, and the effect on chemical constituents in the tobacco. Results indicated that picloram remaining in the soil as a residue at rates of 5 g/A and above can cause serious damage to tobacco. A broadcast spray applied shortly after setting the tobacco in the field was most injurious to tobacco. One-half g/A at this time reduced dollars per acre by about 50%. The tobacco plant gained tolerance to 2.5 g/A by the time it was 24 in tall. Treatments made when the tobacco was 24 in tall and also when treated after topping controlled suckers at rates of 0.5 and also at 2.5 g/A.
10.2307/4041174|Aerial herbicide treatments were made on a native stand of short-leaf pine (Pinus echinata Mill.) heavily infested with noncommercial oak (Quercus sp.), hickory (Carya sp.), and associated species in southeastern Oklahoma from 1957 through 1960. Two formulations of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) were applied in May and September at 1 1/2 lb/A annually in one, two, and three applications with the later two made a year apart. The most diameter growth for all sizes of pine measured occurred following May treatments. Late May aerial applications also were made with 2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy) propionic acid (dichloroprop) and 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy) propionic acid (silvex). Silvex reduced pine cone development, seed fill, and germination. Native grass growth was increased twice following good weed tree control. However, where dense short-leaf pine seedlings developed, the native grasses were smothered and volume of herbage decreased.
10.2307/4041191| Many acid herbicides must be methylated before analysis by gas-liquid chromatography. Several reagents were evaluated for the esterification of substituted acid herbicides. Esterification by the different methods was determined on 2,3,6-trichlorophenyl-acetic acid [fenac], 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid [2,3,6-TBA], 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid [picloram], 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid [dicamba], and 3,6-dichlorosalicylic acid, a possible metabolite of dicamba. The effect of substituent size and position is discussed in relation to esterification. The best methylating reagent for acid herbicides was diazomethane although it is toxic, explosive, and more costly than the other methods. BF-methanol was equally as good when the compound was not sterically hindered. Water interfered with the esterification efficiency of all reagents. Diazomethane esterified the ammonium salt but not the sodium salt of the acids used. 
10.2307/4041190|The herbicidal activity of potassium azide and calcium cyanamid, applied singly and in combination, was evaluated in greenhouse and field experiments. In the greenhouse, the combinations were synergistic against several plant species including yellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus L.) and crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop). The combinations also were synergistic in two field experiments at different locations. In the field, the combinations reduced the number of weed seeds germinating from treated soil over a 6-month period; potassium azide or calcium cyanamid applied singly were not effective. In the laboratory, calcium cyanamid reduced the rate of disappearance of potassium azide from the soil.
10.2307/4041178|Under controlled conditions in a growth chamber, emergence of tumblegrass (Schedonnardus paniculatus (Nutt.) Trel.), redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), and barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crusgalli (L.) Beauv.) was best with an 8-hr night temperature of 65 F and a 16-hr day temperature of 80 F. Other temperature ranges, in order of decreasing effectiveness in stimulating emergence, were 80-95, 50-65, and 35-50 F. Best emergence occurred at the 1/2-in depth of planting followed by 1/4, 1, 2, and 4 in. Barnyardgrass was the only weed that emerged appreciably from the 4-in depth. Average emergence was better on a coarse-textured soil than on a fine-textured soil. Under dry soil conditions, emergence was reduced by soil crusting.
10.2307/4041183|Quantitative measurements were made by cucumber root bioassay of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) contained in washoff (water-soil mixture) from cultivated fallow Cecil sandy loam soil. Formulations of 2,4-D used included iso-octyl and propylene glycol butyl either esters and an alkanolamine salt of the ethanol and isopropanol series. Simulated rainfall intensities and storm durations used represented storm frequencies of 1, 10, 80, and greater than 100 years. The 2,4-D applied at rates of 2.2 or 4.4 lb/A was assayed in washoff and as residue in the soil. Concentrations of 2,4-D in washoff were positively correlated with the rate applied, were greatest early in each storm, and decreased with duration of the storm. The iso-octyl and butyl ether ester formulations of 2,4-D were far more susceptible to removal in washoff than the amine salt. When the amine salt was used, 2,4-D concentrations in washoff were less than 1 ppm, even in the early stages of runoff, whereas concentrations as high as 4.2 ppm were measured using an iso-octyl ester formulation of 2,4-D. When a direct comparison was made between the butyl ether ester and amine salt forms of 2,4-D, ester or amine losses were respectively, 13 and 4% following a 1-year frequency storm and 26 and 5% following a 100-year frequency storm. Soil bioassays showed that most of the 2,4-D remained in the surface 3 in of soil.
10.2307/4041173| A quantitative colorimetric procedure was developed for the determination of N-glucosyl amiben in tissue sections of etiolated seedlings. N-glucosyl amiben biosynthesis in soybean hypocotyl sections was heat labile, sensitive to freezing and thawing, unaffected under anaerobic conditions, dependent on amiben concentration, and proportional to tissue section concentration. The formation of N-glucosyl amiben in soybean hypocotyl sections was greatest between pH 6.3 and pH 7.3 and was inhibited by NaF, HgCl, iodoacetate, iodoacetamide, and N-ethylmaleimide but not by NaCN or NaN. On a specific activity basis, sugar beet seedling, soybean cotyledon, and soybean hypocotyl tissue sections were the most active tissues studied in the biosynthesis of N-glucosyl amiben. 
10.2307/4041186| Results of studies with the herbicide 1-(3-chloro-4-methylphenyl)-3-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (hereinafter referred to as BV-207) suggest that it interferes appreciably with photosynthesis. A concentration of 10 M of BV-207 almost completely inhibited fixation of labelled carbon dioxide by leaf disks of various plants. In addition, carbohydrates protected plants from the phytotoxic action of the chemical. BV-207 was considerably more toxic when plants received light after application of the herbicide, compared with those held in the dark. On the other hand, root growth was inhibited only slightly by BV-207. 
10.2307/4041194|Virginia chain fern (Woodwardia virginica (L.) Smith) was controlled by 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile (dichlobenil) in cranberry bogs on a St. Johns soil at Chatsworth, New Jersey, in experiments conducted during 1960, 1961, 1962, 1963, and 1964. The treatments were applied at emergence of the weed. Stalk counts of the fern were recorded the year following treatment. Excellent control was obtained at either 4 or 8 lb/A of dichlobenil. No re-growth occurred in subsequent years.
10.2307/4041171|Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.), a submersed aquatic weed, has seriously interfered with many water uses in the TVA reservoirs. More than 150 test plots were treated with 34 herbicides from 1960 through 1965. More effective results were obtained with granular preparations of butoxyethanol ester, 2-ethyl hexanol ester, and propylene glycol butyl ether ester of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and liquid preparations of propylene glycol butyl ether ester and potassium salt of 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid (silvex). The two most effective control methods found from field tests were (a) lowering the lake levels enough to permit complete drying of stems and root crowns and (b) applying butoxyethanol ester of 2,4-D in a 20% granular form. Applications of this herbicide to about 3,700 acres at rates of 20 and 40 lb/A gave results that varied from excellent control in protected embayments to poor control in moving water on these large impoundments.
10.2307/4041175|The dimethylamine salt and isopropyl and isooctyl ester formulations of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) were applied at 0, 1/2, 1, 2, and 4 lb/A 21, 14, and 7 days before harvesting Bison hard red winter wheat. Treatment effects on yield, chemical composition, or milling and baking properties of the grain were either nil or of no practical significance. When treated with 1/2 or 1 lb/A, rates generally recommended for farm use, 2,4-D residues in the grain ranged from 0.04 to 0.27 ppm. As rates of the three formulations of 2,4-D were increased from 1/2 to 4 lb/A, increasing amounts of 2,4-D residues occurred in the grain and reached a maximum of 1.8 ppm when the isopropyl ester of 2,4-D was applied at 4 lb/A 14 days before harvest. Grain from plots treated 21 days before harvest had less 2,4-D residue than grain from plots treated 14 and 7 days before harvest.
10.2307/4041172|Complete control of annual bluegrass (Poa annua L.) at all levels of P and at both planting dates was obtained with a,a,a-trifluoro-2,6-dinitro-N,N-dipropyl-p-toluidine (trifluralin) at 2 lb/A. For both planting dates, high levels of P reduced the effectiveness of both calcium arsenate (CaAs) and to a small degree dimethyl 2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalate (DCPA). On a plant count basis, O-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)O-methyl isopropylphosphoramidothioate (DMPA) was more effective than N-(2-mercaptoethyl) benzenesulfonamide S-(O,O,-diisopropyl phosphorodithioate) (bensulide) for the control of annual bluegrass. In the field, injury to bentgrasses (Agrostis palustris Huds.) from preemergence herbicides generally was specific to one or two varieties. Washington bentgrass was severely injured from a 12-lb/A application of 1-(2-methylcyclohexyl)-3-phenylurea (siduron).
10.2307/4041176|Several herbicides were used for control of weeds in Jersey Orange sweet potato plantings on a sandy loam soil at Hammonton, New Jersey, during 1960, 1961, and 1962. The treatments were applied preemergence to the weeds at transplanting of the crop. Data included crop injury scores, level of weed control, effects on yield, influence on internal root color and flavor, and effects on sprouting. Excellent control of germinating annual weeds was obtained with 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben), 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile (dichlobenil). N,N-dimethyl-2,2-diphenylacetamide (diphenamid), and dimethyl 2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalate (DCPA). These herbicides had no adverse effects on yield, quality factors, or growth.
10.2307/4041181|Preemergence herbicides were applied to lawn turf on a loam soil in April, 1963. Polychlorodicyclopentadiene isomers, N-2-mercaptoethyl)benzenesulfonamide (bensulide), calcium arsenate, 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,8a-octachloro-4,7-methano-3a,4,7,7a-tetrahydroindane (chlordane), dimethyl 2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalate (DCPA) 0-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-0-methyl isopropylphosphoramidothioate (DMPA) and 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-tolyl-methylcarbamate (terbutol) were included. Soil of the respective plots were sampled from 0 to 2- and 2 to 4-in depths in December. These soils samples were used for planting plugs of mature Merion Kentucky bluegrass. The cultures were grown for 18 days in the greenhouse. Twenty-three in of rain had fallen between the treatment and sampling dates. Yet root growth was seriously reduced in the soil from the 0 to 2-in depth that had received terbutol and bensulide. Several chemicals gave significant reductions in topgrowth. Preemergence herbicide residues had sufficient influence on Kentucky bluegrass type lawn turf to justify specific study of each chemical with regard to this factor before widespread use.
10.2307/4041184|A 4-year field study was conducted to determine losses and gains in alfalfa production and utilization due to direct competition of various densities of Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.) and their control. Regardless of initial Canada thistle density, within 4 years all stands under no control approached one plant/sq ft. Mowing after each grazing period for 4 years almost eliminated Canada thistle. Throughout the study, the rate of alfalfa stand reduction was the same under mowing treatment regardless of Canada thistle density. Mowing increased alfalfa production 6.2 T/A in 4 years over no control in plots having initial Canada thistle stands of two plants/sq ft. The production loss due to Canada thistle stands of two plants/sq ft was 7.4 T of alfalfa for a 4-year period. Alfalfa consumption was reduced 4.5 T/A.
10.2307/4041188|In field experiments, corn (Zea mays var. Dixie 18) and Johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense) seeds were planted in Norfolk sandy loam soil and treated preemergence with 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) at 0, 2, 4, and 16 lb/A. In growth chamber studies, corn seeds were planted in flats of Independence loamy fine sand and treated pereemergence with atrazine at 0, 2, and 4 lb/A. In nutrient culture studies, corn was treated with 0, 2, 4, and 8 ppmw atrazine. Treated plants of all species and rates tested usually were smaller than untreated plants and contained higher nitrogen percentages. Corn and Johnsongrass plants treated with high rates of atrazine always contained less nitrogen (mg/plant) than untreated plants. Atrazine-treated corn plants contained higher percentages of both 80% ethanol soluble and insoluble nitrogen than the checks. Percentage increases in both fractions were proportional to the rate of atrazine treatment. Nitrate percentages also were increased, but free ammonia content was not significantly affected.
10.2307/4041193| Visible symptoms of injury in susceptible oat plants were not apparent until 4 days after initial exposure to 1 ppm 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) solution. However, the herbicide affected normal absorption and translocation over this period of time. The expected translocation and uniform distribution of xylem transported atrazine-C was stopped after 2 days of exposure to atrazine. The reduction in translocation of atrazine-C to the shoot apices in early stages of herbicidal injury was not due to reduced asborption but very likely to some other factor such as reduced transpiration. Reduction in atrazine-C absorption reduced translocation to the shoot apices, but this probably was not an important factor in the early stages of injury. Absorption of atrazine-C by oat plants was not reduced until 3 days of exposure to atrazine. A reduction in carbohydrate concentration, resulting in injury to root tissues, may be responsible for reduction in total atrazine-C absorption. 
10.2307/4041187| Tracer studies employing 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon)-2-C and -Cl were conducted on barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), and three hypostomatous species-zebrina (Zebrina pendula Schnizl.), coleus (Coleus blumei Benth.), and nasturtium (Trapoelum majus L.). Count data and radioautographic evidence showed that greater amounts of dalapon were absorbed and translocated at high (88  3%) than medium (60  5%) or low (28  3%) post-treatment relative humidity (herein called R.H.). Also, greater uptake and translocation of C occurred in bean at 43  1 C than at 26  1 C post-treatment temperature, with constant R.H. and light conditions. Rate of droplet drying, and stomatal distribution and behavior, apparently contributed to the R.H. effect. Droplets dried less rapidly at high than at low R.H., thus prolonging the period of effective absorption. At low R.H., periodic rewetting of the droplet area enhanced absorption and translocation but never to the extent achieved with high ambient R.H. (in growth chambers) or in saturated atmosphere (polyethylene bagging in the greenhouse). High R.H. (95  3%) favored stomatal opening in zebrina, and uptake of dalapon was greater through the abaxial than adaxial surface of leaf disks of zebrina, coleus, and nasturtium. Rewetting of droplets or high ambient R. H., however, promoted uptake through astomatous as well as stomated surfaces. Absorption and translocation were markedly greater in bean plants grown at 95  3% R.H. than at 28  3% R.H., both treated under high R.H. conditions. Thus cuticle hydration and ontogeny also were implicated in the R.H. phenomenon. Several solution additives also were studied in an attempt to substitute for the R.H. effect. At low R.H., a surfactant (X-77) markedly enhanced uptake of dalapon in bean, glycerol (a humectant) and hexadecanol (a filming agent) were less advantageous, and Plyac (a sticker-spreader) decreased penetration. Results of these studies aid in explaining the greater toxicity of dalapon in regions of high R.H. and, conversely, its sometimes erratic performance in drier climates. The results also confirm the distribution and accumulation patterns of dalapon absorbed by plants and the usefulness of an effective spray adjuvant in promoting foliar absorption. 
10.2307/4041195|Experiments were conducted to evaluate the preplant incorporation and preemergence activity of several herbicides for weed control in southern peas (Vigna sinensis (L.) End.). The selectivity of 4,5,7-trichlorobenzthiadiazole-2,1,3 and 4-(methylsulfonyl)-2,6-dinitro-N,N-dipropylaniline has been demonstrated. Eight other chemicals generally gave good weed control but resulted in injury to the peas.
10.2307/4041180|Rhizome differentation in yellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus L.), cultured under 12 1/2, 14, and 15 1/2-hr photoperiods, 21-16, 27-21, and 33-27 C temperatures (day and night, respectively), Hoagland solutions of 1/32, 1/8, and 1/2 strength nitrogen (N), and 0, 10, and 1000 ppm gibberellin (GA), was investigated in controlled-environment chambers. High levels of N, long photoperiods, and high levels of GA at the shortest photoperiods inhibited tuberization whereas high temperatures at the lowest N level favored tuberization. Shoot formation was promoted by high levels of N, long photoperiods, and high temperatures under 12 1/2 and 14-hr photoperiods while GA had a retarding effect. The higher levels of N, temperature, and GA decreased carbohydrate level whereas the longer photoperiods increased it. It may be concluded that tuberization is not only the result of surplus carbohydrates in the plant but is controlled also by some GA-like substances regulated in the plant under specific conditions of photoperiod and temperature.
10.2307/4041177|The toxicity, adsorption, and leaching of four herbicides in different soils were determined by a method based on a sensitive root bio-assay which appeared suitable for herbicides affecting root growth. The rate of leaching of the herbicides was determined by measuring the herbicidal effect of the leachate obtained from three heights of soil columns. The same bio-assay was utilized for testing the extent of inactivation of herbicides due to adsorption by soil. In this case, mixtures of various rates of soil with silica sand were used as cultures for the bio-assay.
10.2307/4041179| To evaluate the effect of different soil moisture levels on the phytotoxicity of soil applications of arsenic trioxide (AsO), water and alcohol extractable soil arsenic (As) data were related to the growth and development of 4-month-old Monterey pine (Pinus radiata D. Don.) in greenhouse soil cultures. Also, various rates of AsO and water were applied to the surface of soil columns to determine the effective penetration of soluble As. Under normal moisture regime, 8000 lb/A of AsO were required for high phytotoxicity on a Chenango silt loam, with excessive moisture resulting in an increase in this phytotoxic effect. With water and alcohol extraction procedures, an adequate range of values was obtained in relation to the total AsO rates and plant responses. Lethal concentrations of As in the soil columns were limited to the surface 3 in depth in the silt loam. 
10.2307/4041192|Preemergence applications of 5-bromo-3-sec-butyl-6-methyl-uracil (bromacil) and mixtures containing bromacil controlled both broadleaf and grass weeds best, and increased seed production and quality in side-oats grama [Bouteloua curtipendula (Michx.) Torr.] fields. Other herbicides significantly reduced broadleaf weeds but did not control grass weeds. The most troublesome grasses were foxtails; bristly foxtail [Setaria verticillata (L.) Beauv.] was the most prominent. Weed competition, in plots where herbicides were ineffective, significantly lowered seed production. Excessive rainfall after treatment was probably responsible for decreased weed control and increased crop damage from some of the herbicides. Applications of 2,3,5-trichloro-4-pyridinol (pyriclor) resulted in early crop chlorosis.
10.2307/4041189|Satisfactory selectivity of 4-chloro-2-butynyl m-chloro-carbanilate (barban) for the control of wild oats (Avena fatua L.) in spring wheat was obtained when it was applied from 4 to 14 days after emergence of wild oats. Following this period, the effectiveness and selectivity declined rapidly. Depending on the season, this period of maximum efficiency represented the following growth stages of wild oats; 1 to 3-leaf stage in 1960, 1 1/2 to 3 1/2-leaf stage in 1961, and 1 1/2 to 2 1/2-leaf stage in 1962. Injury to wheat was most pronounced during a period beginning about 15 days after crop emergence and continuing for several weeks. This pattern of wild oat control and wheat susceptibility was virtually identical over the 3-year period even though growing conditions varied considerably. This suggests that days after emergence may be at least as reliable as leaf stages as an index for the proper timing of barban treatments and would be more easily determined under practical field conditions. If leaf stages are used, then spraying should not be recommended later than 2 1/2-leaf stage, since in some years, wild oats will have reached resistant stages. Furthermore, it may be desirable to apply barban early, perhaps even before all the plants are fully in the 2 1/2-leaf stage. When wild oats reach the 2-leaf stage, it may be too late, at least in years of abundant moisture.
10.2307/4041196| Herbicides which contain primary or secondary amino groups may be detected on thin layers of silica gel G or silica gel H with 1% tert-butyl hypochlorite, followed with an aqueous solution of 1% KI and 1% soluble starch. Detection limits range from approximately 1 g to less than 0.05 g, depending upon the herbicide in question. The technique also appears to be effective for aromatic or aliphatic iodides. 
10.2307/4041182|A series of three experiments was conducted from 1951 to 1963 for the control of western snowberry (Symphoricarpos occidentalis Hook.) in southern Nebraska. Western snowberry was best controlled with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) when sprayed in early full foliage. Timeliness of herbicide application was considered the most important factor in a control program. Excellent control was obtained with 1 to 2 lb/A of the isopropyl ester of 2,4-D in all studies. The triethanol amine salt of 2,4-D was less effective. A 1:1 mixture of 2,4-D + 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) at 1 and 2 lb/A, 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA) at 1 and 2 lb/A, and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole) at 2 and 4 lb/A were not as effective for western snowberry control as 2,4-D. Mowing was an ineffective method of control.
10.2307/4041206|A soil column system for determination of relative movement of herbicides in soils is described. A data presentation system which expresses the results for each herbicide in a given soil as a single number is proposed. Comparisons of mobilities of new herbicides with those known for other older, better understood herbicides should make it possible to predict the behavior of new herbicides in the field. The aromatic acid herbicides were most mobile, and the insoluble toluidines least mobile. Results for 28 herbicides are presented.
10.2307/4041205| Herbicidal residues in water and soil were determined after treating eight ponds with six herbicides. Relatively high concentrations of 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile (dichlobenil), 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid (fenac), and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) were present in the upper 1-in of the hydrosoil following treatments with granular formulations of these herbicides. Fenac and dichlobenil residues persisted in both water and soil for periods exceeding 160 days. Low concentrations of 2,4-D were found in water for 24 days and in the soil for 55 days following treatment. The mono-N,N-dimethylcocoamine salt of 7-oxabicyclo(2.2.1)heptane-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (amine salt of endothall), 1,1-dimethyl-4,4-bipyridinium salt (paraquat), and 6,7-dihydrodipyrido(1,2-a:2,1-c)-pyrazidiinium salt (diquat) were relatively less persistent in water and were no longer found after 24, 8, and 4 days, respectively. However, paraquat and diquat were held by the hydrosoils and persisted in high concentrations for more than 85 and 160 days, respectively. In ponds with dense weed infestations, a large fraction of the herbicide may be held by the plants for some time. 
10.2307/4041213| Three experiments were conducted over a period of 2 years on native grasslands in an attempt to suppress or control the resident vegetation to permit the establishment of alfalfa. Spring applications of 1,1-dimethyl-4,4 bipyridilium salt (paraquat) at 1 lb/A were effective in suppressing the existing grasses and forbs, thereby enhancing alfalfa establishment; however, woody perennials were not effectively controlled. Application of a mixture of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid(butyl ester of 2,4-D) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (iso-octyl ester of 2,4,5-T) (2:1 ratio) at 1 1/2 lb/A prior to paraquat treatments and alfalfa seeding also was ineffective in controlling woody perennials. Alfalfa could not be successfully established when seeded 6 days after the application of phenoxy herbicides. Fall applications of paraquat at rates up to 1.5 lb/A were not effective in suppressing the resident vegetation; thus, alfalfa seeded in the following spring failed to establish an adequate stand. 
10.2307/4041223|Selected clones of field bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis L.) differing in susceptibility to foliage applications of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) were used in testing some of the various mechanisms proposed for the selective action of this chemical. The differences found in external morphology, such as degree of pubescence and number of stomata, showed no relationship to the selective action of 2,4-D. Entry of the chemical into the plant and translocation within the stem also were not critical factors. The most pronounced physiological differences between resistant and susceptible clones of bindweed occurred at the cellular level. When incubated in a nutrient agar containing 2,4-D, excised stem sections of both clones produced callus tissue, but the callus of the susceptible clone, as compared to the resistant, was approximately double in volume, dry weight, and degree of hydration. With increasing age, stem sections of the susceptible clone became even more responsive to 2,4-D; the reverse was true for the resistant. The differential response of the two clones was less pronounced when 2,4-D was applied to the roots than when it was applied to the foliage.
10.2307/4041211|Wet tropical forests have a high diversity of woody species which cause problems in sampling and analysis of data regarding herbicidal effectiveness. Three simplified sampling procedures were tested to determine their reliability in providing an estimate of whole-plot defoliation from broadcast applications. A procedure using a 50-tree sample including all species will provide the most reliable data.
10.2307/4041214|Corn, cotton, peanuts, and soybeans in various rotations received six separate herbicidal treatments in a 5-year rotation from 1959 through 1963. Several of the combination treatments were highly effective in controlling witchweed (Striga spp.). Land heavily infested with witchweed required 3 to 4 years of herbicidal treatments before the competition of witchweed was eliminated and normal corn yields were produced. The most effective treatment for the control of witchweed without crop injury was postemergence applications of 1/2 lb/A 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) as needed in continuous corn. At the end of the 5-year study, all plots were planted to corn, Using corn yields as a criteria, there were no differences in witchweed competition in herbicide treated plots with continuous corn and herbicide treated plots in which corn was rotated with other crops.
10.2307/4041208|A field study was made on the competitive effect of quackgrass (Agropyron repens (L.) Beauv.) on corn for the nutrients N, P, and K during 1962 and 1963. Quackgrass competition drastically reduced corn height and yield and delayed maturity. High levels of fertilization did not overcome the effects of quackgrass competition. The annual uptake by quackgrass during the growing seasons of 1962 and 1963 was 105, 15 and 60 lb/A of N, P, and K, respectively. Quackgrass shoots harvested at maturity in mid-July had taken up 55, 45, and 68% of the total N, P, and K, respectively, that was removed throughout the season by quackgrass shoots plus rhizomes. It appeared that the early season uptake of N and K by quackgrass may have contributed to, but was not solely responsible for, the reduction in corn height and yield and delayed maturity noted later in the season.
10.2307/4041209|The effect of a,a,a-trifluoro-2,6-dinitro-N,N-dipropyl-p-toluidine (trifluralin) on the growth of cotton seedlings was studied under greenhouse conditions as influenced by dosage, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 lb/A, and depth of soil-incorporation, 0 to 6 in in 0.5-in increments; the cotton seed were planted 1.5 in deep and watering was by subirrigation. Trifluralin caused stunting in height of cotton seedlings and prevention of lateral root growth. The dosage of the chemical influenced the degree and persistence of stunting more than did depth of incorporation. Marked stunting occurred at 1 lb/A at all depths of incorporation and persisted for the duration of the experiments, about 1 month; slight to moderate stunting occurred at 0.75 lb/A or less but was of short duration, 1 to 2 weeks. Lateral root growth was affected more by depth of incorporation than by dosage; though the growth of the taproot was essentially unaffected, the growth of lateral roots was completely prevented by even the lowest dosage applied, 0.25 lb/A, incorporated to the greatest depth, 6 in. Root growth was prevented only along that portion of the taproot growing in treated soil; when trifluralin was incorporated above the seed, root development was unaffected. Stunting occurred independently of the effect on root growth.
10.2307/4041210| Soil incorporation and site of uptake of preemergence herbicides was investigated under greenhouse conditions using green foxtail (Setaria viridis (L.) Beauv.) and the herbicides 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine), 2-chloro-N-isopropylacetanilide (hereinafter referred to as CP31393), 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben), 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methoxy-1-methylurea (linuron), ethyl N,N-dipropylthiolcarbamate (EPTC), and ,,-trifluroro-2,6-dinitro-N,N-dipropyl-p-toluidine (trifluralin). As depth of incorporation of most herbicides was increased, control of green foxtail decreased, indicating a dilution effect. Subsurface application of herbicides at a 2-in depth generally was less than half as effective as surface application or shallow incorporation. With three different moisture conditions, shallow incorporation of trifluralin to depth of 1 in was beneficial at all moisture levels. Shallow incorporation of atrazine and EPTC improved effectiveness under conditions analagous to furrow irrigation but not under conditions simulating moderate or high rainfall immediately after application. Shallow incorporation of the ammonium salt of amiben increased effectiveness significantly under high moisture but decreased effectiveness under low moisture. Effectiveness of linuron was reduced by incorporation under moderate and high moisture. Shallow incorporation did not significantly affect results with CP31393 under any moisture condition. For the six herbicides tested, the expression of lethal action on tops of green foxtail was evident when herbicide was placed in the shoot zone but not when placed in the root zone during the 2-week period after seeding. 
10.2307/4041202|Sixteen field tests conducted over 12 years showed that, under the soil and climatic conditions prevailing in the Peace River region of western Canada, application of maximum rates of 20 lb/A of 2, 2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon) combined with tillage did not kill more than 95% of quackgrass (Agropyron repens (L.) Beauv.). Best treatment was to rejuvenate the quackgrass in the spring by thorough tillage, apply the dalapon when the resprouts were 4 to 6 in tall, till thoroughly again about 2 weeks later, and then till at monthly intervals until freeze-up. The type of implement used was not important, providing the quackgrass rhizomes were thoroughly shredded. With rates of dalapon at or below 20 lb/A, no residual effect occurred on cereal crops planted in the spring following the year of treatment.
10.2307/4041216|The depth of leaching of 3(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron) in a Yolo sandy clay loam soil was altered by the various types-anionic, cationic, or nonionic-of surfactants. The effects of surfactants Aliquat 204 and Aliquat 221 on the leaching of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methoxy-1-methylurea (linuron), 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron), 1-butyl-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methylurea (neburon), and diuron may reflect a sorption complex of the substituted urea herbicide, surfactant, and the soil. This sorption appears to be closely associated with the dilauryl portion of the surfactant molecule. Other surfactants of the Aliquat series containing lauryl, dioctyl, and distearyl substitutions had little or no effect on this sorption phenomenon.
10.2307/4041217|Differences in degree of seed dormancy were shown to exist both among and within the four varieties of wild oats (Avena fatua L. spp. fatua (L.) Thell.) occurring in natural infestations throughout southwestern Alberta. Among the varieties, pilosissima was the most dormant, intermedia was more dormant than vilis, and glabrata possessed about the same dormancy as intermedia. Dormancy was overcome more rapidly under dry storage in vilis and glabrata than in intermedia and pilosissima. Seed dormancy of most collections made in 1959 differed from that of collections made at the same locations in 1962, being both higher and lower by as much as 40% in either of the varieties vilis or intermedia. In seeds from plants grown as transplants at three sites, dormancy differed within varieties, but there was no consistent pattern of difference evident among sites.
10.2307/4041222|Plots planted to corn (Zea mays L. var. Mo. 880) were treated with 0, 2.5, 5, and 10 lb/A of 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) or 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) plus 0, 100, or 200 lb/A of nitrogen fertilizer. Yields of corn forage harvested 5 weeks after planting were significantly reduced by herbicidal treatments. Reductions were more pronounced on corn treated with simazine than with atrazine. In a given year, yields of corn forage from each successive harvest were reduced less, percentagewise, than the previous ones. Yields of corn grain generally were unaffected by herbicidal treatments, except when 10 lb/A of simazine were applied. Herbicides caused an increase in percent nitrate in forage approximately 5 weeks after treatment. Percent of nitrogen in corn forage rose sharply, approximately 5 weeks after planting, due to herbicidal treatments, especially on plots not treated with nitrogen fertilizer.
10.2307/4041207|Treatments made at 2-week intervals on guava (Psidium guajava L.) with a 1:1 ratio of butoxyethanol esters of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid:2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D:2,4,5-T) have shown it to be more susceptible when treatments are made during the wet season than during the dry season. Greater susceptibility is related to a plant condition characterized by many new leaves but little or no terminal twig elongation. A similar pattern of defoliation response is caused by 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (dicamba) and 2,3,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram) as by 2,4-D:2,4,5-T, but the period of maximum susceptibility based on defoliation percentages 1 year after treatment occurred later in the season.
10.2307/4041218|Amitrole (3-amino-1,2,4-triazole) is absorbed and actively bound to non-physiological sites in Salmonella typhimurium. Accumulation of amitrole is inhibited by purines; but the effect does not seem to explain adenine protection against growth inhibition by amitrole. Guanine, xanthine, and hypoxanthine cannot replace adenine in growth protection but do inhibit accumulation of amitrole in the bacterial cells.
10.2307/4041219|Subsurface application of liquid or granular formulations of ethyl N,N-dipropylthiocarbamate (EPTC) at planting time effectively controlled annual grass weed species in new seedlings of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.). Control of annual broadleaf weeds by EPTC was incomplete. A postemergence application of 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)butyric acid (2,4-DB) in addition to the EPTC treatment resulted in excellent overall weed control. Benefits of weed control were more evident in birdsfoot trefoil than alfalfa.
10.2307/4041225|Effect of 3,5-dimethyltetrahydro-1,3,5,2H-thiadiazine-2-thione (DMTT) on the growth of Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) seedlings was studied at constant levels of soil moisture maintained by capillary fringes. A high content of water depressed the growth of plants but preserved their normal morphological balance. A low content of water produced succulent seedlings with inferior root systems. The results suggest that DMTT is better adapted to fine-textured soils with restricted aeration. Maintenance of water supply at field capacity of the soil also may improve the balance of nursery stock and its survival potential.
10.2307/4041200|Thiobacillus thioparus, Azotobacter chroococcum, Rhizobium leguminosarum, Aspergillus niger, Paramecium caudatum, Colpidium sp., and a mixed culture of soil ciliates were not adversely influenced nor stimulated by the presence of dimethyl 2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalate (DCPA). Soil from plots treated 7 years at 5.0 ppm showed no accumulation of DCPA. Plate counts of actinomyces, bacteria, and molds from field and laboratory-treated soils showed no adverse effect. A mixed culture of soil algae and fungi grew significantly more in the presence of DCPA.
10.2307/4041201|The selective properties of 5-amino-4-chloro-2-phenyl-3-(2H)-pyridazinone (pyrazon), a new herbicide for the control of weeds in sugar beets, were investigated. Common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.), redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), and green and yellow foxtail (Setaria viridis (L.) Beauv. and S. glauca (L.) Beauv.) represented about 77% of the weeds emerging and developing with beets. The preemergence rate of 4 to 5 lb/A pyrazon satisfactorily controlled the two broadleaf weed species but was marginal in controlling foxtail. At 6 and 7 1/2 lb/A, beet stands were reduced; however, because of the standard practice of overseeding, normal stands were possible and yields of roots and extractable sugar were unaffected. Preemergence applications of aqueous suspensions of pyrazon were more satisfactory than postemergence. The addition of miscible non-phytotoxic oils or adjuvants to aqueous mixtures greatly improved the postemergence activity of pyrazon. In spite of the occasional temporary beet injury, beets in the two to four-leaf stage seemed relatively tolerant to postemergence treatments. Control was excellent when weeds were treated in the seedling stage (i.e. between cotyledon and four true leaves).
10.2307/4041227|A truck sprayer for applying herbicides to brush is described. It consists of a three-section, hydraulically controlled boom capable of spraying about a 22-ft swath on brush up to 12 ft tall. The spraying system is mounted on a 3/4-T truck equipped with additional lights for night spraying. Plots 22 ft wide by 50 to 200 ft long are sprayed.
10.2307/4041212| Postemergence application of isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate (CIPC) killed small seedlings or redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), large crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis L.), and pale smartweed (Polygonum lapathifolium L.). However, the apparent mode of action in redroot pigweed and large crabgrass was different from that in pale smartweed. The first two species showed injury symptoms 1 to 2 days after spraying, while the effect of the herbicide on pale smartweed was slow and no growth inhibition was observed until about 2 weeks after application. Injury symptoms of smartweed were different from those of the other two species. Tolerance of redroot pigweed and large crabgrass to CIPC increased rapidly with age. Studies on respiration, CO fixation, and chlorophyll content showed that the fast action in redroot pigweed and large crabgrass was accompanied by a reduction in photosynthesis, decrease in chlorophyll content, and increase in respiration. In pale smartweed, where slow action of CIPC took place, there was no change in carbon dioxide fixation, chlorophyll content, or oxygen uptake until about 2 weeks after spraying, when symptoms of this type of action were first observed. 
10.2307/4041204|A laboratory assay method was developed for studying pricklypear (Opuntia sp.) responses to herbicides. Herbicidal translocation from one pad to another and lateral translocation across a pad appeared to be very slight. Pads were killed when a butoxy ethanol ester, a propylene glycol butyl ether ester, or a 2-ethylhexyl ester formulation of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) was applied to only one side. Increasing temperatures from 21 to 43 C increased the rate of killing pads. Concentrations of 2,4,5-T at 8 lb aehg of solution usually killed the pad at temperatures above 21 C. Concentrations of 2,4,5-T at 4 lb aehg or less had little effect on the pads. Relative humidity level had little effect on 2,4,5-T activity, but the activity of a propylene glycol butyl ether ester of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) was more effective at the 90 to 95% level than at levels ranging from 30 to 75%. Water, diesel oil, and three diesel oil:water mixtures had little effect on 2,4,5-T toxicity. More toxic effects were shown by 2,4,5-T than 2,4-D. The propylene glycol butyl ether ester, the butoxy ether ester, and the 2-ethylhexyl ester of 2,4,5-T were equally effective on pricklypear at the same concentrations.
10.2307/4041220|Prior to planting of birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.), stony soils were sprayed with ethyl N,N-dipropylthiocarbamate (EPTC) at 0, 2.0, or 4.0 lb/A and were tandem-disked or harrowed 0, 1, 2, or 3 times or rotary-tilled to incorporate the herbicide. Rotary tillage was the best incorporation method where stones were not numerous. Tandem disking was the most practical. Annual grasses were controlled by 2.0 lb/A EPTC and one incorporation. Higher rates of EPTC and more incorporations resulted in better annual broadleaf weed control and increased yields of birdsfoot trefoil.
10.2307/4041221|The herbicides 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T), and 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (dicamba) each labeled in the carboxyl position were sprayed on a pasture consisting of a mixture of silver beardgrass (Andropogon saccharoides Swartz), little bluestem (A. scoparius Michx.), and dallisgrass (Paspalum dilatatum Poir.) and a sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula [Michx.] Torr.) pasture over a 3-year period. Plant samples were harvested at intervals between 1 hr and 16 weeks after treatment and residues determined by radioassay. No important differences were found in the persistence of herbicides or of different formulations of the same herbicide. Rainfall was the most important factor influencing the persistence of the herbicides. The little bluestem-silver beardgrass-dallisgrass samples harvested 1 hr after treatment with the butoxyethyl ester of 2,4,5-T contained both this ester and the acid of 2,4,5-T. One week after treatment, the acid of 2,4,5-T and unknown metabolites were found but no ester.
10.2307/4041203|Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) yields were correlated negatively with weed yields and positively with stover yields, sorghum heads per plant, and sorghum weight per 1000 seeds. Sorghum yields were not different when weeds were removed 1, 2, or 3 weeks after planting and each week thereafter, but a significant yield decrease occurred each week when weeds were not removed for 4, 5, 6, or 8 weeks. Sorghum kept weed-free the first 4 weeks after planting showed little yield loss from weeds emerging later. Weeds left after two cultivations reduced sorghum yields 38% below plots weeded weekly. As weed competition increased, sorghum grain yield, stover yield, sorghum heads per plant, seed weight per head, and weight per 1000 seeds decreased, whereas sorghum seed moisture at harvest increased.
10.2307/4041226|Growth of Oxalis cernua Thunb. was determined in different temperature regimes. Growth occurred in the 55 to 75 F range. Temperature variation promoted growth. Bulbs sprouted more rapidly and uniformly after storage at 35 F than after storage at 95 F. The weed probably is best adapted to areas with winter soil temperatures between 55 and 75 F.
10.2307/4041224|Damping-off of pea (Pisum sativum) seedlings in autoclaved soil subsequently inoculated with Pythium debaryanum ATCC 9998 grown in potato dextrose broth in presence of 75 ppmw O-(2,4-dichlorophenyl) O-methyl isopropylphosphoramidothioate (DMPA) was not different than in soil inoculated with the fungus grown in potato dextrose broth without DMPA. Damping-off of pea seedlings was less in autoclaved soil subsequently inoculated with Pythium debaryanum ATCC 9998 and to which DMPA (100 ppmw) had been added than in inoculated soil with no DMPA present. Damping-off of pea seedlings germinated in soil from plots that had received annual applications of DMPA, 15 lb/A, was nearly as great as that in the control plots.
10.2307/4041215|The potassium salt of 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram) was applied as soil, foliar, and soil plus foliar treatments to defoliated and non-defoliated huisache (Acacia farnesiana (L.) Willd) grown in the greenhouse. Soil applications of 1/8 lb/A were more effective than foliar treatments. However, soil or foliar applications at 1/2 lb/A were lethal on non-defoliated plants. Defoliated plants treated with 1/2 lb/A showed considerable regrowth, indicating that leaves were important for absorption and movement of the herbicide into stem and root tissues. Plants treated with 1/4 lb/A of picloram and defoliated after 0, 4, 10, and 24 hr indicated that 24 hr were necessary to obtain maximum herbicidal effectiveness. Picloram content was determined in the leaves, upper stem, lower stem, and roots by gas chromatographic analysis, 3, 10, and 30 days after treatment. Most of the picloram applied to foliage was found in and on the leaves 30 days after treatment. The upper stem contained several times more picloram than the lower stem. No detectable amounts of picloram were found in the leaves and upper stem 3 and 30 days after soil treatment. The concentration of picloram in roots from soil applications was similar to foliar treatments. Absorption and movement studies showed that a period of 24 hr was required to move lethal amounts of picloram into stem and root tissues of huisache after foliar treatments.
10.2307/4040632|The use of insects in the biological control of weeds necessitates that these insects have very restricted host ranges. Specialized insects boring in stems or living in seed pods have adaptations which obligate them to their host plant. However, the leaf-feeding beetle, Chrysolina quadrigemina Suffrian, imported for the control of St. Johnswort (Klamath weed) (Hypericum perforatum L.) through its feeding habits, tropistic responses and synchronization of its life history to the growth phases of the plant has shown that it is restricted to its preferred host plant.
10.2307/4040631|Bristly thistle (Cirsium horridulum Michx.) is an important perennial weed in Alabama pastures. It may remain vegetative many years before flowering and may regrow from the roots after flowering. A heavily infested pasture produced about 10,000 seedlings per acre per year of which 73% established from January through April. There was an average of 150 achenes per head but many did not contain fully developed seed. Essentially equal numbers of red and yellow flowered types were found. From two to as many as six successive cuttings below the soil surface were necessary to kill thistle plants. Thistles were effectively controlled by 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA).
10.2307/4040642|Marked differences in the response of field bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis L.) to 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) were found among plants grown from seed obtained from 19 states in the U. S. and one province in Canada. These differences were not correlated with the origin nor with plant vigor. Inherent physiological differences seemed to be responsible.
10.2307/4040635|The toxicity of 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) and 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isoproylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) to eight crops was determined. The crops in order of increasing tolerance to these herbicides were Southern Giant Curled mustard (Brassica juncea (L.) Coss.), Missouri 0-205 oats, Straight Eight cucumbers (Cucurbita sativa L.), Knox wheat, Clark soybeans, RS610 grain sorghum, GT-112 inbred corn, and F-6 inbred corn. Inactivation of simazine and atrazine applied at 2 lb/A on field plots, as determined by soybean and oat bioassay, was most rapid when the soil environment was favorable for the growth of microorganisms. Very little inactivation occurred between September, 1960, and June, 1961, following a May, 1960 application. One year after application, 0.16 lb/A of atrazine and 0.31 lb/A of simazine were detected, but neither was detected after 16 months.
10.2307/4040638|2-chloro-4-isopropylamino-6-ethylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) applied at 3 lb/A to wheat stubble shortly after harvest in 1961 and 1962 controlled all vegetation for the remainder of the season. 2-chloro-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (propazine) was nearly as effective as atrazine in 1962. Grain sorghum was planted in the spring of 1962. No preplanting tillage was used, and no weed control measures were needed in sorghum during the growing season on the treated plots, and crop stands, vigor, and grain yields were superior to those on the cultivated checks.
10.2307/4040640|Two lines of corn (Zea mays L.)-one, GT112 RfRf, resistant to 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) and 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine), and the other, GT112, susceptible to both-were used. Both glucose and sucrose, supplied to the treated plant through a severed leaf tip, were found to protect GT112 from the toxic effect of atrazine and simazine. Glucose gave a slightly better protection. Oxygen uptake in excised roots of GT112 treated with atrazine gradually declined with age until death, while leaf discs of treated and untreated lines showed no distinct trend in oxygen uptake. Atrazine decreased root respiration in GT112 but had no effect on that of GT112 RfRf. Root respiration in untreated GT112 was higher than in untreated GT112 RfRf. Atrazine decreased leaf respiration when both lines were considered.
10.2307/4040633| A single-gene homozygous recessive mutant in an S inbred line of corn resulted in an 8- to 10-fold reduction in 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one content. Aqueous suspensions of acetone extracts from low segregates formed little 2-hydroxy-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (hydroxysimazine) when incubated with 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine). Tolerance studies on 3:1 and 1:1 segregating ears indicated that the low segregates were somewhat less tolerant to 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) supplied in solution culture. 
10.2307/4040645|A tractor-mounted experimental plot sprayer for applying herbicides is described.
10.2307/4040639|Seeds of largeseed dodder (Cuscuta indecora, Choisy), field dodder (Cuscuta campestris, Yuncker), and small-seeded dodder (Cuscuta approximata, Bab.) were studied on the basis of (1) germination at different temperatures, and (2) spring emergence of seedlings as related to soil temperature. Small-seeded dodder germinated at 35 to 45 F with maximum germination at 60 F. Largeseed dodder germinated very little and field dodder not at all below 50 F. They germinated best at 60 F and above. Dodder seeds were planted outside at different depths in a sandy loam soil during the autumns of two years. Daily counts on seedling emergence during the spring showed that small-seeded dodder was first to germinate, at a soil temperature of 39 F, largeseed dodder emerged from 7 to 10 days later at a soil temperature of 51 F, and field dodder emerged 2 to 4 days still later. Very few seedlings of the small-seeded dodder emerged after mid-May, but largeseed and field dodders continued to emerge throughout the summer.
10.2307/4040641| Metabolism of C-labeled and unlabeled atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine) was studied in oats, soybeans, and beans (susceptible); cotton and peanuts (intermediate in susceptibility); and Johnsongrass, grain sorghum, and corn (resistant). Atrazine residues were found in all plants 11 days after a preemergence application of 1 lb atrazine/A. Methanol was found to be a better extraction solvent for atrazine and hydroxyatrazine than chloroform. Undegraded atrazine found in plants was roughly correlated with susceptibility, but atrazine absorption was not directly correlated with plant susceptibility. Radioactivity remaining in plant residue after methanol extraction likewise was not completely correlated with susceptibility. All plants converted some atrazine to hydroxyatrazine and the amount of hydroxyatrazine formed was somewhat correlated with resistance. The three resistant species converted at least twice as much atrazine to hydroxyatrazine as did the susceptible soybean and oats. Beans converted considerably larger amounts of atrazine than did other susceptible species. 
10.2307/4040624|Four concentrations of 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron), 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron), 1-n-butyl-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methylurea (neburon) and 3-phenyl-1,1-dimethylurea (fenuron), adsorbed on photometrically uniform filter paper, were irradiated with ultraviolet light 253.7 millimicrons) or sunlight. Marked changes in the absorption spectra after irradiation indicated photodecomposition of the four herbicides was different with the two light sources.
10.2307/4040625|Recrystallized 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine), 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine), and 2-methylmercapto-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (ametryne) were adsorbed on filter paper, and exposed to ultraviolet light (253.7 millimicrons) or sunlight. All underwent photodecomposition, which was different under ultraviolet light and sunlight.
10.2307/4040630|Strains of hoary cress, particularly within the lens-podded species (Cardaria chalepensis (L.) Hand.-Maz.), varied greatly in leaf size and shape, spreading ability, stand density, and reaction to treatment with several herbicides. Without competition, heart-podded hoary cress (C. draba (L.) Desv.) spread farther and produced a denser stand than either lens-podded or globe-podded cress (C. pubescens (K. A. Meyer) Jarm.), and, in general, was more susceptible to 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA) than lens-podded cress. Within 12 strains of lens-podded hoary cress no relationship was found between susceptibility to 2,4-D or 2,3,6-TBA and any other characteristic.
10.2307/4040629|Collections of plants of medusahead, Elymus caputmedusae L., were made from natural infestations in Nez Perce County and Washington County in northern and southern Idaho, respectively. The ash and silica content (dry weight basis) decreased as the plant matured. The total ash of the entire plant contained from 72-89 per cent silica. Similar percentages of silica in ash were obtained in the culms, heads, and seeds of the plant. X-ray diffraction patterns and polarizing microscope examinations showed the mineral form of silica to be opal. Heavy deposition of silica was found in the barbs of awns, in the epidermis of the leaves, culms, glumes and seeds, and in strands beneath the epidermis.
10.2307/4040637|Flat pea (Lathyrus sylvestris L.), previously investigated as a forage plant in the United States, is a perennial legume with undesirable qualities of low palatability, difficulty of establishment, and a toxic principle. Characteristically aggressive and tolerant to a wide range of growth conditions, it is a potentially serious weed in its area of adaptation. A related species, everlasting pea (L. latifolius L.), has similar characteristics. A 2-lb/A rate of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T), 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid (silvex), or 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA) followed by 2-lb/A of silvex a year later gave complete control of established plants and seedlings of flat pea.
10.2307/4040643| A grass seed attachment to a grain drill was modified to apply granular herbicides using positive metering mechanism. Uniformity of granule output was adjusted within  4% maximum error. Speed of travel did not appreciably affect the amount of granules applied per acre. 
10.2307/4040647|Catalase and peroxidase activities were run at several ages on two lines of corn (Zea mays L.)-GT112 RfRf, resistant, and GT112, susceptible to 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine). Atrazine significantly decreased catalase activity in GT112, while in treated GT112 RfRf catalase activity was usually significantly increased. Catalase activity was higher in GT112 RfRf than in GT112 for both treatments at all ages. GT112 RfRf had a higher peroxidase activity than GT112 when both were untreated, but when treated with atrazine there was no overall trend.
10.2307/4040644|The resistance of corn to the herbicides, 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine [simazine] and 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine), may be related to stalk rot and corn borer resistance. Of five inbred lines of corn studied, three with known resistance to stalk rot and corn borer were found to be much more resistant to simazine and atrazine than were two inbreds which were susceptible to stalk rot and corn borer.
10.2307/4040626|Amitrole (3-amino-1,2,4-triazole) and 5-chlorobenzo-1,2,3-triazole were the only compounds tested that inhibited wheat root elongation and growth of carrot explants, produced chlorosis, and depressed catalase activity. Ten other heterocyclic compounds were more effective in inhibiting growth in wheat roots or carrot explants. Overall biological activity was reduced when substituents other than the amino group on the number three position were substituted on the triazole nucleus.
10.2307/4040627|Seven different types of nozzles were compared as to uniformity of spray application, spray drift, and tendency to clog. The wide angle whirl chamber nozzles applied the spray more uniformly than other nozzles. Increasing nozzle height to 1.5 times the recommended height increased uniformity of spray application with most nozzles. Lowering the nozzle height to half the recommended height seriously reduced uniformity of spray application with almost all nozzles except the wide angle whirl chamber nozzles which provided a uniform spray at all 3 heights. The whirl chamber nozzles were least easily clogged of the nozzles studied. Wettable powders normally applied in 30 gallons or more per acre have been satisfactorily applied at rates of less than 1/4 of this amount. Spray drift was reduced to a no crop hazard level, with effective coverage, at rates of application as low as 7 gallons per acre.
10.2307/4040636|The alkanolamine salt of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), the dimethylamine salt of 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA), and the sodium salt of 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid (fenac), were evaluated in controlling witchweed and toxicity to corn on germinating seed in petri dishes, as preplanting, preemergence, and postemergence treatments in the greenhouse and as preplanting, soil-incorporated treatments in the field. Corn roots were affected more than the shoots by each herbicide. Fenac and 2,4-D inhibited root growth of corn seedlings in petri dishes more than 2,3,6-TBA. Fenac was the most effective herbicide for control of witchweed and weedy grasses when applied as a preplanting, soil-incorporated treatment and controlled witchweed at rates which significantly increased corn yields. Applied preplanting, 2,4-D did not control witchweed and 2,3,6-TBA at rates which gave witchweed control equivalent to that obtained with fenac was toxic to corn.
10.2307/4040634| The amount of C-labeled triazine herbicides absorbed by the upper and lower surfaces of peanut (Arachis hypogea) leaves was found to be significant with the exception of 2-methoxy-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (prometone). Almost always a surface active agent increased the absorption of triazine herbicides by the leaves. The surface active agent did not play any role in diffusion of these herbicides. Among the four herbicides tested 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) and 2-methoxy-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (prometone) were found to move both acropetally and basipetally, whereas 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) and 2-chloro-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (propazine) moved only in the acropetal direction. 
10.2307/4040646|Thirteen treatments during a 5-year period with a 1: 1 mixture of the propylene glycol butyl ether esters of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,4-5 trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) were required to eradicate an established stand of kudzu, Pueraria lobata (Willd.) Ohwi.
10.2307/4040628| The rates of decarboxylation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 2-chloro-4-fluorophenoxyacetic acid and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) in excised leaves of blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica Muenchh,) were determined by collecting the CO evolved from carboxyl-labeled herbicides. 2,4,5-T was decarboxylated only in trace amounts. 2,4-D was decarboxylated to a maximum of about 1 per cent and 2-chloro-4-fluorophenoxyacetic acid of about 7 per cent, of the amounts taken up by the leaf. Decarboxylation rates for 2,4-D in June were highest in persimmon (Diospryos virginiana L.) and blackjack oak, and were very low in winged elm (Ulmus alata Michx.), sweet gum (Liquid-ambar styraciflua L.), and green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh.). The rates of decarboxylation of 2,4-D apparently were not correlated with susceptibility to 2,4-D. 
10.2307/4040758| The most promising of 13 herbicides for the control of southern naiad (Najas guadalupensis (Spreng.) Magnus) were acrylaldehyde (acrolein), mono-N,N-dimethylcocoamine and di-N,N-dimethylcocoamine salts of 7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (endothall), 6,7-dihydrodipyrido[1,2-:2,1-c] pyrazidiinium salt (diquat), and 1,1-dimethyl-4,4-bypyridinium salt (paraquat). Acrolein and the 2 alkylamine salts of endothall gave the most rapid kill of southern naiad but retreatment was necessary at the end of 16 weeks. Diquat and paraquat were the 2 most promising materials evaluated. Large scale applications of acrolein, di-N,N-dimethylcocoamine salt of endothall and diquat confirmed these results. Diquat and paraquat were the only herbicides of the 13 that were not toxic to fish. 
10.2307/4040760|Plants of Zebrina pendula L., Phaseolus vulgaris L., Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers., and Chenopodium album L. were sprayed with a solution containing herbicide (sodium 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid or sodium 2,2-dichloropropionic acid), surfactant (sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate), and fluorescent tracer (sodium pyrenetrisulfonate). In most instances plants having stomata relatively open absorbed more tracer (based on UV observation) and more herbicide (based on injury and growth responses) than those with stomata relatively closed. Differences, however, were less than those expected from studies using detached leaves, probably from poorer control of stomatal aperture in intact leaves. There was good agreement between degree of opening and tracer uptake.
10.2307/4040761|Monuron [3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea] and neburon [1-n-butyl-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methylurea] were applied to a sandy loam soil which was planted to several crops in southern California. Monuron at 2, 4, and 8 lb/A and neburon at 2 lb/A were below phytotoxic levels by 12 months. Neburon at 4 lb/A persisted at phytotoxic levels for over 16 months, and at 8 lb/A for over 24 months.
10.2307/4040753|Seeds of winged elm (Ulmus alata Michx.) stored under moist conditions lost viability rapidly. Under dry conditions the seeds lived longer. Winged elm seeds would not germinate at 4 C or 42 C but did at temperatures between these points. Salt concentrations above 20,000 ppm killed the seed; concentrations below this inhibited germination; twelve per cent manitol solutions (16 atmospheres osmotic pressure) prevented germination; pressures lower than this decreasingly affected germination. If the soil moisture level was below 2%, winged elm seeds would not germinate. Removal of the outer husk of the seed did not affect germination. Winged elm seedlings did not emerge if planted at depths below 1/4 inch.
10.2307/4040763|The ribonucleic acid (RNA) content of corn roots and etiolated coleoptiles treated with amitrole (3-amino-1,2,4-triazole) was very similar to that in untreated tissues. Amitrole consistently decreased the acid-soluble nucleotide content of etiolated corn coleoptiles.
10.2307/4040752| The effects of thirteen plant growth regulators and herbicides on glucose absorption, metabolism, and incorporation in pea root tissues were studied. Both indoleacetic acid (IAA) and gibberellic acid (GA) caused no effects, while -naphthaleneacetic acid (-NAA) and -naphthaleneacetic acid (-NAA) caused an increase in catabolic and a decrease in anabolic processes, with the C-1 carbon undergoing the largest change. The absorption of glucose was also inhibited considerably by the synthetic auxins. The carbamates, isopropyl N-phenylcarbamate (IPC), n-Ethyl-N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (EPTC), and 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron) inhibited slightly the glucose absorption. All affected the catabolic process to a certain extent while only IPC caused a change in the anabolic process. Both 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (TBA) and 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) decreased glucose absorption and increased glucose-1-C catabolism. TIBA also affected the anabolic process. Other herbicides, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole), maleic hydrazide (MH), 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine), and 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon) caused varied degrees of inhibition to glucose absorption. Both simazine and dalapon increased C-1 catabolism and exerted no effect on the anabolic process. Only dalapon altered the catabolism of glucose-6-C. Amitrole and MH decreased the over-all catabolic process with no effect on the pathway; both chemicals increased the anabolic process. 
10.2307/4040762|When weeds were controlled in sorghum by handweeding or a herbicide there was no advantage or need for cultivation. Control of weeds in sorghum with preemergence herbicides was feasible, but the combination of cultivation and herbicides gave more dependable weed control than either method used alone. Preemergence applications of 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) were the most effective for controlling weeds and increasing sorghum yields. In decreasing order of effectiveness were 2-chloro-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (propazine), 2-chloro-N,N-diallylacetamide (CDAA) + trichlorobenzyl chloride (TCBC), and postemergence atrazine applications.
10.2307/4040766|If there was no heavy rainfall or surface irrigation before corn emergence, as ethyl-N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (EPTC) at 3 lb/A was incorporated deeper into the soil, more corn plants were injured, the height of plants was reduced, and a loss in weight or yield occurred, although the germination of the corn seed was not affected. Implements used to incorporate EPTC did not produce significantly different amounts of corn injury where used at the same depth.
10.2307/4040748| In short-term studies, diquat (6,7-dihydro-dipyrido(1,2-a:2,1-c) pyrazidiinium salt) and paraquat (1,1-dimethyl-4,4-dipyridinium salt) caused a stimulation in respiration and an inhibition in photosynthesis of duckweed (Lemna minor L.). Atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine) and monuron [3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea] caused inhibition of the Hill reaction at rates lower (10M) than diquat and paraquat (10M), and diquat was considerably more effective than paraquat. The effect of a combination of monuron and diquat on O production was additive. Inhibition of the Hill reaction by these dipyridyliums was directly related to their redox potentials. Autoradiographs of chromatograms and electrochromatograms as well as CO studies indicated that neither diquat nor paraquat was degraded in alligatorweed [Alternanthera philoxeriodes (Mart.) Griseb.] and garden, or snap beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L. var. Black Valentine). 
10.2307/4040747|The nature and mode of action of surfactants is reviewed. Surfactants are useful additives for formulated herbicides because they contribute to wetting, spreading, emulsification, and solubilization of the herbicide. The use of extra surfactant to increase herbicidal activity is a desirable practice. The factors in selecting a suitable agent are discussed in terms of surfactant properties.
10.2307/4040764| The minimum red-light (> 590 m) intensities from fluorescent tubes at which growth or maintenance of original fresh weight were obtained at 20 C in a growth chamber for 28 days were 11-20 foot-candles for waterstargrass (Heteranthera dubia [Jacq.] Mac M.) and 12-45 foot-candles for coontail (Ceratophyllum demersum L.). Duckweed (Lemna minor L.) frond number increased significantly at 45 foot-candles red light, and the fresh weight probably increased at 45 foot-candles. The intensites of 11-45 foot-candles constituted 1.0-3.8 percent of the red portion of full sunlight. 
10.2307/4040751| The fate of the C label in ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiol-carbamate (EPTC) was studied following root uptake by alfalfa plants for periods of 2 and 5 days. The uptake and movement of the C label in alfalfa was demonstrated by means of autoradiographs and measurements of radioactivity with a Geiger-Mller detector. The amount of radioactivity accumulating in plants during the 5-day uptake period was approximately twice the amount accumulating in 2 days. The autoradiographs of plants receiving the 5-day uptake treatment showed an accumulation of C in the youngest tissue. Radioactive CO was liberated by the treated plants and their extracts contained a large number of C labeled compounds. 
10.2307/4040757|All horizontal underground structures were roots and not rhizomes. The small, light-colored feeder roots are short-lived and consist mainly of primary tissue. Only one transition zone per clone was found. This was found in the collet (lower hypocotylary swelling). The transition from exarch, radial stele of the root, to endarch, collateral stele of the upper collet, was complete in approximately 2500 microns. All root primordia examined had endogenous origin from pericycle and pericyclic tissues. Buds arose endogenously in roots but exogenously in the region of the hypocotyl with endarch protoxylem. Primordia were often identified as roots or shoots prior to their emergence from the main axis.
10.2307/4040767|Dimethylarsenic acid (cacodylic acid), 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (dicamba), 2,6-dinitro-N,N-di-n-propyl-alpha-alpha-alpha-trifluoro-p-toluidine (trifluralin), and O-(2-4-dichlorophenyl) O-methyl isopropyl-phosphoramidothioate (DMPA) were tested to determine if they could selectively control nimblewill (Muhlenbergia schreberi J. F. Gmel.) in Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) pasture. DMPA reduced the nimblewill population 95% during the initial year of treament, while other herbicides gave only 61 to 72% reduction. No effect on nimblewill was evident the second year after application. None of the herbicides caused severe or permanent injury to the bluegrass.
10.2307/4040754| Stationary and portable field sampling equipment and techniques are described for the collection of gaseous and aerosol forms of 2,4-D compounds. Air was sampled at the rate of 1 liter per minute through 10 ml of n-decane in a modified midget impinger maintained at approximately 1 C. Field sampling was conducted at two eastern Washington sites for approximately 106 days during the summer of 1963. The presence of isopropyl, butyl, and isooctyl esters of 2,4-D in the atmosphere was established by electron capture gas chromatography. Twenty-four hour average atmospheric concentrations of these esters ranged from undetectable to 3.1 g/m. 
10.2307/4040750|Application of 20 to 40 lb/A dichlobenil made prior to emergence accomplished various degrees of control of pondweeds (Potamogeton diversifolius, P. foliosus, P. pectinatus, P. pusillus) and a slender naiad (Najas flexilis). Coontail (Ceratophyllum demersum) was affected only by the higher dosage. Limited control and growth inhibition was achieved on several forms of algae in early spring applications. However, applications made to rooted submersed aquatic plants and filamentous algae (Cladophora, Pithophora and Chara) at postemergence stage of development had little herbicidal effect. Dichlobenil was not acutely toxic to fish at herbicidal concentrations. The range of median tolerance limits was 10 to 20 ppmw for pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus), bluegill (L. macrochirus), redear sunfish (L. microlophus), and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides).
10.2307/4040759|Saltcedar (Tamarix pentandra Pall.) and Woods rose (Rosa woodsii Lindl. var. ultramontana [Wats.] Jeps.) were sprayed with systemic herbicides at frequent intervals over a 2-year period. Root samples were collected at each spray date and analyzed for "total available carbohydrates." Food reserve levels in the roots and response to herbicides were not correlated.
10.2307/4040749|Selections of wild oats (Avena fatua L.) had varying degrees of resistance to isopropyl N-phenylcarbamate (IPC). Strains with gray glabrous lemmas and non-dormant seed tended to be more resistant to IPC than those with brown pubescent lemmas and dormant seed.
10.2307/4040746|Selected, representative research on surfactants, herbicide penetration, and plant cuticles was reviewed briefly. New evidence was presented that surfactants influence the activity of herbicides in oil sprays as spectacularly as in aqueous sprays. Most of the experimental facts about surfactants were integrated in a blanketing theory for entry of herbicides by separate hydrophilic and lipophilic pathways.
10.2307/4040765|After 10 months, diphenamid residues were found throughout the 0-9 inch soil depth. In silt loam soils under climatic conditions prevailing in and around the bluegrass region of Kentucky, diphenamid residues in soils may be present at phytotoxic levels in the plow layer 10-11 months after application at rates required for weed control in tobacco.
10.2307/4040756|Greenhouse experiments showed that monuron, 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea, uniformly applied to the soil surface immediately after planting, was about twice as toxic to seedling cotton as was diuron, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea. Phytotoxicity was increased when either of these herbicides was applied with either of the systemic insecticides phorate, O,O-diethyl S-(ethylthio) methyl phosphorodithioate or Di-syston, O,O,-diethyl S-[2-(ethylthio) ethyl] phosphorodithioate.
10.2307/4040745|In the last few years the possibility of growing small fruits and several vegetable crops without any soil disturbance has been demonstrated. On many soil types crop yield has been unaffected and has sometimes shown a slight increase compared with traditional cultivation. Advantages of non-cultivation include the possibility of increasing crop uniformity and yield by using closer row spacings and completely new methods of crop production, the avoidance of injury to surface-feeding roots, decreased risk of frost and easier mechanical harvesting of some crops. In small-fruit plantations the weed problem has greatly diminished after about 3 years, because of non-disturbance of seeds lying below the germinating zone and the absence of a "seed-bed". While the surface crust that sometimes forms where the soil is not disturbed may affect plant growth in certain circumstances, no evidence was obtained in recent experiments in Britain that a crust was detrimental to the growth of established plants. However, water infiltration on bare non-cultivated soil was sometimes retarded and increased run-off occurred on sloping sites. Due to the wide diversity of soil types, climatic conditions and crop response it is impossible to generalize about the effect of eliminating cultivation. Nevertheless, as some of the advantages are considerable while the disadvantages can often be overcome it seems likely that non-cultivation practice will extend to many horticultural crops in the future.
10.2307/4040755|Seed of common cattail (Typha latifolia L.) germinated 100 percent when the blunt ends of the seed coats were ruptured. Seedlings developed primarily while submersed in water. Growth of the seedlings was rapid. A single plant in 6 months developed a network of rhizomes covering an area 10 feet in diameter. Pistillate spikes 7 inches long produced an average of over 222,000 seeds.
10.2307/4040614|Band applications of residual preemergence herbicides were equal to timely shallow cultivations for the control of annual weeds in corn, and were superior when wet weather delayed or interfered with early shallow cultivations. The average corn yield reduction of 7.4 bushels per acre from weed competition observed over a 13 year period, suggested that under average conditions the net cost of herbicide treatment would be less than the value of corn lost through failure to control weeds.
10.2307/4040604|Preemergence herbicides for the control of crabgrass, (Digitaria ischaemum (Schreb.) Muhl. and D. sanguinalis (L.) Scop.) were applied on bluegrass sod at three different rates for three years to determine residual effects on the stand and vigor of perennial ryegrass, red fescue, tall fescue, and Merion and common Kentucky bluegrass seedlings. With few exceptions, the herbicides retarded stand and vigor of these turfgrasses seeded in turf killed with methyl bromide. Chlordane was least and a commercial arsenic complex plus 7% N most toxic to young seedlings. Seedlings of Merion Kentucky bluegrass were most resistant to herbicide injury. No appreciable decrease in original turf density was noted except for the arsenic complex material which severely injured bluegrass turf at the two heavier rates. Germination of the same turfgrasses seeded in flats of sterilized soil in the greenhouse 1 day, 41 days, and 93 days after the application of preemergence crabgrass herbicides, showed the most reduction in emergence from treatments with DMPA [O-(2,4-dichlorophenyl) O-methyl isopropylphosphoramidoate], trifluralin (2,6-dinitro-N,N-di-n-propyl-alpha-alpha-alpha-trifluro-p-toluidine), DCPA (2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalic acid), and dipropalin (N,N-di-n-propyl-2,6-dinitro-p-toluidine). Lead arsenate was least injurious to germinating seedlings. Tall and red fescue were more tolerant to herbicides than the other grasses studied.
10.2307/4040611| The adsorption of herbicides from aqueous solution by muck (organic soil), bentonite, an anion exchanger, and a cation exchanger was studied. The nature of the adsorbent, pH, and temperature all influenced adsorption, and different herbicides responded differently to changes in these factors. Lowering of the pH resulted in increased adsorption by bentonite of all of the herbicides studied, except 6,7-dihydrodipyrido (1,2-a: 2, 1-c) pyrazidiinium salt (diquat) which was completely adsorbed at both a high and a low pH. The influence of pH was greatest for 4,6-dinitro-o-sec-butylphenol (DNBP) and 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine). The DNBP was adsorbed by an anion exchanger, but not by a cation exchanger, while isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamate (CIPC), 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron), and atrazine were adsorbed by both. Diquat was completely adsorbed by the cation exchanger and only slightly by the anion exchanger. All were adsorbed by muck but to verying extents as follows: diquat > CIPC > DNBP > monuron > atrazine. No relationship was found between water solubility and adsorption. Adsorption by bentonite (pH 8.5) was much greater at 0C than at 50C, but adsorption by muck was the same at both temperatures. Desorption studies were conducted using C-labeled atrazine, monuron, 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine), 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben), and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). Repeated extractions with distilled water desorbed these herbicides from bentonite and muck and their desorption was more readily accomplished from bentonite than from muck. 
10.2307/4040613| Results of studies with microorganisms suggest that 5-bromo-3-isopropyl-6-methyluracil (isocil) does not interfere appreciably with pyrimidine metabolism. Instead the uracil herbicides studied appear to act in higher plants as inhibitors of photosynthesis. Strong inhibition of the Hill reaction of isolated chloroplasts by substituted uracils was noted I of 2.7  10 M for isocil). Exogenously supplied carbohydrates partially nullified toxicity symptoms in intact barley plants growing in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of isocil. 
10.2307/4040597| Derivative of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), type of bottom sorbent, and application concentration affected the rate and quantity of 2,4-D released into water from attapulgite granules. All three factors were temperature dependent. Temperature, granule size, and solution pH affected the rate during short exposure periods, but not the total quantity of release of herbicide during 256 hours. Generally, decrease in temperature was associated with a decrease in rate of release of 2,4-D. Decrease in granule size slightly increased the rate of release. Increased acidity reduced the rate of release of 2,4-D acid. Types of attapulgite granules were not significantly different. Rates of subaqueous release of eleven granular herbicides were measured at concentrations of 10, 15, and 20 g ai/ml. Compounds tested were 2,4-D and its butoxyethanol ester (BE), propylene glycol butyl ether ester (PGBE), and isooctyl ester (IOE) derivatives, tris-(2,4-dichlorophenoxyethyl)phosphite, the IOE of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, the BE, PGBE, and potassium salt of 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid (silvex), the sodium salt of 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid, and 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid (fenac). The rate of release of herbicides from granules varied from complete release of silvex potassium salt in 4 hours to less than 10 per cent release of 2,4-D IOE in 256 hours. 
10.2307/4040610|Volunteer wheat and downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.) were consistently controlled by aerial applications of granular 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) without supplemental tillage. Injury to winter wheat seeded in the fall 13 and 14 months after application of atrazine has occurred. Plots aerially treated with 2 lb/A atrazine produced yields comparable to the check but plots treated with 4 lb/A atrazine produced no wheat. Use of persistent herbicides for chemical fallow must be restricted until further knowledge is obtained.
10.2307/4040600| Volatilities of 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine [simazine], 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine [atrazine], 2-chloro-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine [propazine], 2-methoxy-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine [prometone], 2-ethylamino-4-isopropylamino-6-methylmercapto-s-triazine [ametryne], 2,4-bis-(isopropylamino)-6-methylmercapto-s-triazine [prometryne], and 2-chloro-4-diethylamino-6-ethylamino-s-triazine [trietazine] were studied at different temperatures. In descending order at 25 C the relative volatilities of the herbicides from nickel-plated planchets were prometone  trietazine > atrazine  ametryne  prometryne >propazine  simazine. Prometone losses from five soils appeared to be directly related to per cent sand and inversely related to per cent clay and organic matter. Atrazine and simazine losses from the same soils appeared to be less influenced by soil properties than prometone. All seven s-triazines were examined at one temperature on wet and dry Tifton loamy sand. Moisture level affected both the amount of compound lost and the relative order of loss among compounds. Conversion of atrazine and prometone to their corresponding hydroxy analogues was a practical method for preventing vapor losses from planchets. 
10.2307/4040606| Relative vaporization losses of five C ring-labeled 2-chloro-4,6-alkylamino-s-triazines were studied at 25 and 60 C. Herbicide solutions in 95% ethanol were deposited on metal planchets, dried and counted at intervals. The herbicides, ranked in order of decreasing volatility, were: trietazine (2-chloro-4-diethylamino-6-ethylamino-s-triazine), ipazine (2-chloro-4-diethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine), atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine), propazine (2-chloro-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine) and simazine (2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine). Prometone (2-methoxy-4,6-bis (isopropylamino)-s-triazine) and the 2-hydroxy analogues of simazine and propazine, dissolved in water at pH 2-3 (HCl) before plating, showed no detectible loss in 25 hours at 60 C. Foliar penetration and acute toxicity following drop application of the five 2-chloro-triazines and prometone to corn, soybean, tomato, cotton, oat and sorghum appeared to be correlated with their water solubilities. A surfactant tended to enhance activity. Important differences were noted among species, although apparently not related to inherent herbicidal tolerance or susceptibility. Tomato was most sensitive to acute toxicity; soybean cotyledons were least permeable. Basipetal translocation was negligible under all conditions (e.g. 6 herbicides, 6 species, 2 solvents, with or without a surfactant). The 2-hydroxy analogues tended to translocate downward but appeared restricted by acute, acid (pH 2-3) destruction of the transport mechanism. Acropetal (apoplastic) movement of all compounds occurred readily with transpiration, reflecting the vasculature of the species. All 2-chlorotriazines and prometone (but not the two 2-hydroxy compounds) showed pronounced accumulation of C in the lysigenous glands of cotton. Root uptake and distribution of C within the plant body occurred generally for all compounds and species. 
10.2307/4040598|Mixtures of CDAA + atrazine or propazine applied preemergence gave excellent grass and non-grass weed control and no sorghum injury. Such mixtures offer promise of more consistent weed control than either component alone and less soil residue than a higher rate of atrazine or propazine alone. CDAA + trichlorobenzyl chloride preemergence was a less effective mixture but gave better grass weed control and poorer non-grass control than propazine or atrazine pre- or postemergence. Atrazine or propazine postemergence following CDAA preemergence gave excellent results. The best time to spray sorghum with atrazine or propazine between planting and the 11-leaf stage was when the weeds were in the very early postemergence stage. Sorghum was tolerant at all times of application. Atrazine over all trials averaged superior to propazine as an herbicide for grain sorghum.
10.2307/4040612|Yield reductions from the heaviest stand of smooth pigweed (Amaranthus hybridus L.) averaged 39% for corn and 55% for soybeans. For corn the increase in pigweed dry matter about equalled the decrease in the dry matter from the crop; the total dry matter yield was relatively constant. Pigweed grew taller than soybeans, and the dry weight of crop plus pigweeds was 1 1/3 times that of weed-free soybeans. As stand of pigweed was increased, there was a decrease in yield of grain, cobs and stalks or straw, diameter of cornstalks, height of crop, and soybean pods per plant. Yield reductions obtained emphasize the importance of both chemical and cultural measures for reducing competition between row crops and weeds.
10.2307/4040605|When applied in enough water to wet tubes of dry Pullman silty clay loam top soil to a depth of 22 inches, dimethylamine salts of 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA) and polychlorobenzoic acid (PBA) were leached to about 20 inches; an amine salt of 2,4-dichlorophenozyacetic acid (2,4-D) and the sodium salt of 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid (fenac) leached to 15 inches; esters of fenac, 3-phenyl-1,1-dimethylurea (fenuron), 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron) and amine salts of 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyl)propionic acid (silvex) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) leached to approximately 9 inches. Esters of silvex, 2,4,5-T, and 2,4-D remained in the top 3 inches of soil. The leaching with additional water was in the same general order as just given.
10.2307/4040603|Complete control of established plants of absinth wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) was obtained with a single application of borax derivatives at 650 lb/A or less. Of several phenoxyacetic, benzoic, and borax compounds which were tested, the most effective, economical treatment was 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). Competition from perennial grasses was beneficial. Fall tillage prevented the establishment of absinth seedlings, and intensive tillage during the summerfallow year eradicated established plants.
10.2307/4040608|Movement of 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (dicamba) and N,N-dimethyl-2,2-diphenylacetamide (diphenamid) in Hagerstown silty clay was greater with either 5 or 10 surface inches of water when the water was applied in 0.25-inch increments rather than 1-inch. Upward movement of these herbicides occurred under sub-irrigation and when surface-applied water was allowed to evaporate freely from the soil surface. Dicamba always moved more readily than diphenamid. The results indicate that weather patterns may be important in addition to total rainfall in determining the movement of herbicides in soil.
10.2307/4040602|The persistence of soil-surface applied ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate [EPTC] was studied at air velocities of 3/4 to 4 mph in special air-flow equipment. Persistence was inversely related to velocity though the effect was quantitatively changed by soil composition and the materials used in formulating the EPTC spray.
10.2307/4040619|Birdsfoot trefoil, timothy, and sterile pea plants treated with 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy) butyric acid [4-(2,4-DB)], formed 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) to about the same extent. Apparently the enzymatic ability for beta oxidation can reside in the plant as well as in microorganisms.
10.2307/4040620|Black henbane (Hyoscyamus niger L.) has invaded cultivated land, pastures, and disturbed areas in east central Saskatchewan. This species flourishes during cycles of abundant moisture and disappears during dry cycles, surviving in Saskatchewan only in moist depressions or disturbed areas. Summerfallow, fall tillage, and competition from vigorous perennial grasses provide effective control of the weed. Black henbane is not likely to become a serious deterrent to crop production in Saskatchewan.
10.2307/4040615| This investigation studied simazine (2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine), atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine), propazine (2-chloro-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine), and prometone (2-methoxy-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine). Preemergence applications of granular formulations of simazine on attaclay or calcium sulfate of simazine at 1 to 2 ppmw controlled Potamogeton, Najas, Ceratophyllum, Heteranthera and Zannichellia. Higher rates were required to control filamentous algae (Cladophora and Pithophora) and chara (Chara vulgaris). Early postemergence applications of wettable powder to submersed aquatics and filamentous algae were often effective. Atrazine gave similar results. Concentrations of 0.5 to 1.0 were effective in controlling Cladophora and Pithophora and three species of Potamogeton in pond applications. Spray applications, generally, were more effective than broadcasting granular atrazine. Propazine and prometone did not control submersed species in concentrations up to 3 ppmw. Simazine had a relatively high margin of safety with respect to acute toxicity to fish. It was less toxic than propazine, prometone or atrazine. Granular forms were less toxic than wettable powder or emulsifiable concentrates. Laboratory tests on bottom organisms gave an acute LD toxic dosage of 28 ppmw. Field observations did not demonstrate a serious reduction in the production of bottom organisms. However, the control of aquatic vegetation brought about ecological changes affecting bottom dwelling and weed clinging organisms. These changes would affect certain fishes with special food habits. 
10.2307/4040609|The postemergence herbicidal activity and specificity of 16 s-triazines on 8 test species were determined at 3 application rates and the influence of various substitutions discussed.
10.2307/4040607|Ford soybean yields and weed yields were studied under combinations of tillage treatments, 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben) applications, hand weedings, and row spacings on irrigated and non-irrigated locations in Nebraska during 1961 and 1962. Soybean yields increased and weed yields decreased with tillage, amiben applications, hand weedings, and narrow-row spacing of soybeans. Combinations of these weed control treatments gave more dependable results than any one alone. Each 86 lb/A of weeds present produced an average soybean yield reduction of 1 bu/A. Advantages of growing soybeans with amiben applications in 10-inch rows as compared to 40-inch rows are: (a) an average soybean yield increase of 39%, (b) elimination or reduction of tillage (c) a 50 to 75% reduction in amiben application rate, and (d) little or no soybean injury from the lower rates of amiben required in the 10-inch rows.
10.2307/4040617|Absorption and translocation in both leaves and roots is less under low temperatures. Seasonal response of wheat to 2,4-D is conditioned by the stage of growth as well as environment. The response of wheat and downy bromegrass to triazine herbicides is seasonal, whereas the response to carbamate herbicides appears to be influenced by local environmental conditions at time of spraying. Physiological condition of fiddleneck is more important than age, i.e., plants in the rosette stage were always far more sensitive than bolting plants of the same age. Sensitivity to 2,4-D was greater at 26 C than at 10 C or 5 C at all stages of growth. Applications of certain metabolites, especially thiamin, increased the sensitivity of fiddleneck to 2,4-D at low temperatures.
10.2307/4040616|Alligator juniper (Juniperus deppeana Steud.) is a weed tree of Arizona and New Mexico. It sprouts from stems, roots, or especially from buds on the crown, whenever the top is destroyed. Adequate mechanical control requires that the root crown be removed from the soil. Treatment of stumps with pelleted 3-phenyl-1,1-dimethylurea (fenuron) on the soil or polychlorobenzoic acid (PBA) sprayed on the stumps are promising means of preventing sprouting.
10.2307/4040599| An effective technique was developed for partitioning the environment of intact submersed aquatic plants. The technique facilitates absorption and translocation studies by permitting application of radioactive herbicides to selected portions of the plants. Root and shoot treatments of Potamogeton pectinatus L. for 24 to 96 hours with C-labeled 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid (fenac) showed no leakage across the partitioned system. Little or no basipetal translocation of the herbicide was observed. Limited acropetal translocation occurred and this was reduced by removal of tubers prior to herbicide application. Accumulation of activity in nodal regions of the stem was noted. 
10.2307/4040618|B. verticillata Meyer was killed by selective rates of 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid (fenac), but not by selective rates of nine of the most common phenoxy herbicides. It was also killed by soil-sterilant rates of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron) and 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA) but not by soil-sterilant rates of three s-triazine compounds. With all herbicides, treatments made in the wet season gave better results than those made in the dry season.
10.2307/4040601|Experiments were conducted in 200-gal concrete tanks to evaluate a large fresh-water snail, Marisa cornuarietis, as a biological aquatic weed control agent. Adult Marisa snails were collected from a canal near Miami, Florida, where a colony had recently become established. These snails are of South American origin and appear identical to those being used in Puerto Rico for biological control of schistosomiasis. The snails controlled Ceratophyllum demersum, Najas guadalupensis, and Potamogeton illinoensis completely and Pistia stratiotes and Alternanthera philoxeroides partially. Eichhornia crassipes was not completely eaten, but its growth and flowering were greatly retarded by the root-pruning action of the snails. Marisa preferred submersed weeds to floating or emersed weeds, but the floating weed Salvinia rotundifolia was eaten nearly as readily as submersed weeds. Little damage was done by Marisa to 4- and 5-week-old rice plants, but younger rice was killed when the snails had no other source of food. A common snail-eating bird, Cassidix mexicanus, was found to be a predator of Marisa in Florida. Except for its possible deletarious effects in rice-growing areas, Marisa was regarded as very promising for control of aquatic weeds at least in confined bodies of water.
10.2307/4040735|When crop plants were competing with well-established quackgrass (Agropyron repens) for the same nutrient supply, chlorosis and stunting of crop plants occurred. Apparently this was due to the greater ability of quackgrass to withdraw available nutrients, especially nitrogen, and to a lesser extent phosphorus and potassium, from the nutrient solution. No evidence was obtained for a phytotoxic substance from living quackgrass roots or rhizomes that could inhibit germination or growth of alfalfa and oats. Quackgrass residues in large amounts caused chlorosis and stunting in alfalfa and oats when added to soil. The evidence obtained linked this behavior to the high C:N ratio with consequent temporary deficiency of available nitrogen. Water extracts of quackgrass leaves or rhizomes were not phytotoxic unless subjected to high temperatures during or subsequent to extraction. If soils contained decomposing quackgrass or crop plant residues, extremely phytotoxic extracts of such soils were obtained, but only when soils were saturated and decomposition was anaerobic.
10.2307/4040740|In a closed system the vapors from the potassium salt of 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid caused severe damage and death of Pinto beans. Vapors from the potassium salt of 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid caused more injury to Pinto beans than vapors from the same application rates of the propylene glycol butyl ether esters of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid or the dimethylamine salt of 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid.
10.2307/4040738|Soil-surface applications of isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamate (CIPC), 2-chloroallyl diethyldithiocarbamate (CDEC), ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (EPTC), sodium 2,4-dichlorophenoxyethyl sulfate (sesone), and N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) were made on a Willacy fine sandy loam just before and after a 24-to-32 mph windstorm, which moved significant amounts of treated soil. All treatments were overhead-irrigated after the storm. All herbicides performed less efficiently after the wind. CIPC was found below the surface of soil only when applications were undisturbed by the wind.
10.2307/4040722|As the seeds of leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.) increase in age after fertilization, their color changes from yellow to yellow with brown tips, to brown ends with a narrow yellow band, to brown with an orange band, and to a reddish-brown seed, followed in order by brown, gray-brown, gray, and finally, mottled. The last four are viable; the others are not. Mowing of leafy spurge to prevent viable seed production must be done before seeds have turned brown. Brown seeds appeared 10 to 13 days after fertilization depending upon seasonal conditions.
10.2307/4040732|Experiments were conducted at Lincoln, North Platte, and Alliance, Nebraska, during 1961 and 1962 to determine the effect of tillage, atrazine, hand-weeding, and row spacings on RS 501 sorghum and weed yields. Combinations of tillage, narrow row spacings, and preemergence 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isoproplyamino-s-triazine (atrazine) treatments gave more dependable weed control than any one alone. Sorghum yields increased and weed yields decreased with tillage and atrazine treatments. Preemergence atrazine applications as low as 1 lb/A gave higher sorghum yields and lower weed yields than postemergence atrazine applications of 2 to 4 lb/A. Preemergence atrazine applications should be reduced on lighter soils because atrazine gives more effective weed control and increased sorghum injury on such soils. There was a 1 bu/A decrease in sorghum yield for each 50 lb/A of weeds present.
10.2307/4040724| Jimsonweed (Datura stromonium) was treated with carboxyl-labeled C 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D*); autoradiographs and extraction of radioactive materials were used to determine the movement and form of the herbicide. Activity rapidly decreased in the leafy tissue. There was an accumulation of activity in the stem, but very little accumulation in the roots. With the exception of the stem tissue where minor alteration of the herbicide occurred, 2,4-D* was the only radioactive material recovered from jimsonweed. A loss of radioactivity from the root systems indicated a possible detoxification mechanism for jimsonweed. Up to 25% of the 2,4-D* applied to jimsonweed was expelled from the roots in six weeks. 
10.2307/4040739|Internal dormancy was shown to occur in western ironweed (Vernonia baldwinni Torr.) and leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.) in late summer and fall. Time required for emergence and extent of growth were important indicators of dormancy. Dormancy is apparently broken naturally in the field by low soil temperatures.
10.2307/4040727| Paraquat (1,1-dimethyl-4,4-dipyridylium cation) removed weedy annual grasses from seedings of rose clover (Trifolium hirtum All.) and subclover (T. subterraneum L.) with only temporary damage to the clovers when applied at early growth stages. Paraquat applied under weed-free conditions reduced herbage yields of Lana woollypod vetch (Vicia dasycarpa Ten.) and Wimmera ryegrass (Lolium rigidum Gaud.) at three dates of application; neither herbage nor seed yield of rose or subclover was reduced. 
10.2307/4040718|Weed Science-a new scientific discipline, has evolved and caused a revolution in agricultural technology. Weeds and their control are basically ecological and economic problems. The losses caused by weeds and the cost of their control, now estimated to exceed $4 1/2 billion annually, are motivating forces in the revolution. The technological revolution in Weed Science is characterized by the rapid and extensive acceptance and use of chemical weed control methods, expanded scope and diversity of weed research, advances in Weed Science technology, needs and challenges for advances in future technology, impact of chemical weed control on farm management practices, and its effect on the objectives and direction of agricultural research and educational programs. Chemical methods of weed control greatly reduce energy requirements on farms. Herbicides reduce the manpower, machine hours, and machine horsepower requirements in crop production. Thus, herbicides provide a new dimension for improving farming efficiency and lowering production costs. In 1962, chemical methods of weed control were used on more than 70 million acres of agricultural land at a cost of more than $272 million, as compared to approximately 53 million acres treated in 1959 at a cost of $128 million, a 33 percent increase in the acreage treated in 1962. The acreage treated in 1962 was equivalent to about 25 percent of the national crop acreage. These use data do not include chemical weed control on industrial sites and other non-agricultural lands. Chemical weed control is having a far-reaching impact on all phases of crop production. New chemical methods of weed control will affect choice of crop and variety; seedbed preparation; method of seeding; seeding rates; row spacing; plant spacing in the row; plant populations; fertilizer practices including type, time of application, and placement; cultivation; irrigation practices; harvesting; seed-cleaning operations; erosion control; fallow practices for weed control; disease and insect control practices; pasture renovation; pasture and range management; clearing new lands for crops or pasture; forest management; utilization of farm water resources for irrigation and recreation; and maintenance of drainage ditches, ditchbanks, irrigation canals, and farm roadsides. Agriculture is on the horizon of a second-generation breakthrough in production efficiency because of the revolution in Weed Science. Already the accomplishments made possible by this revolution have established the necessity for a new research cycle in crop production that can result in new plateaus of crop yields, crop quality, and production and harvesting efficiency.
10.2307/4040733|In one study, twelve treatments consisting of 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine), 2-chloro-4,6-bis-(ethylamino)-6-isoproplyamino-s-triazine (simazine), 3-(p-chloro-phenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron) and 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron) applied alternately in a program pre- and postemergence to the weeds were evaluated on ten sugar cane plantations. Averaged data indicated that combinations including atrazine outperformed simazine in every instance and diuron was better than monuron on all plantations but one. Diuron was most effective on grasses, e.g., Digitaria spp. whereas atrazine was outstanding against Commelina diffusa Burm. In a second study on the same plantations, the initial treatment of 5 lb/A of atrazine followed by 3 lb/A of diuron gave outstanding weed control on five plantations. Using 3 lb/A of each material applied simultaneously had merit at times but some plantations required only a single application of either material. Net days of weed control obtained by diuron were inversely dependent on the amount of chemical adsorbed by the soil in both studies and total days control appeared to be dependent on ample rainfall in the second.
10.2307/4040723|Livestock losses, mainly to cattle, from Astragalus miser Dougl. ex Hook. (timber milkvetch) have been reported since 1927. The species is found in the northwestern United States and also in Alberta and British Columbia. Recent taxonomic treatment distinguishes eight varieties. The most northern variety (A. miser var. serotinus (Gray) Barneby) and the most southern variety (A. miser var. oblongifolius (Rydb.) Cronq.) are the only two varieties known to cause livestock losses, but all varieties should be regarded as poisonous until it is known they are not. A. miser var. oblongifolius was controlled with 2 lb/A of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) or 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxypropionic acid (silvex). Removal of A. miser increased both cover and frequency of grass species.
10.2307/4040730|In two experiments beans were kept weed-free for various periods early in the season, and in a third, weeds were allowed to grow with beans for various periods before being removed. Weeds which emerged soon after planting caused extensive reductions in bean yields, but the actual yield-reducing competition occurred considerably later in the season. For 5 to 7 weeks after planting, the grower must control weeds by chemical or other means; for the remainder of the season, bean competition provides weed control.
10.2307/4040737|A system involving resting cells of Euglena gracilis provides a rapid and convenient test system for screening potential herbicides which act as inhibitors of chlorophyll synthesis. The system appears to distinguish between inhibitors of chloroplast formation, such as 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, and inhibitors of chlorophyll formation per se, such as ethionine.
10.2307/4040728|Direction and rate of translocation of sucrose* from urea* 2,4-D* (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) and amitrole* (3-amino-1,2,4-triazole) were toward regions of active growth. In oak seedlings translocation was slower than in cotton seedlings. In oak seedlings growing leaves and shoots constitute active sinks toward which tracers move. Sucrose* from urea* translocates freely; 2,4-D* moves less freely because of accumulation enroute; amitrole* is intermediate between these. High humidity induces rapid and extensive uptake of tracers by oak seedlings; the increase over normal transport is mainly in the xylem.
10.2307/4040726|Swainsona salsula is an unpalatable legume of Asiatic origin which spreads by seed and lateral roots and has become a problem in some poorly drained, marshy, or saline areas of several western states. Its growth characteristics indicate a high potential for establishment along stream banks, irrigation canals, wasteways, pastures, and meadows with high water tables and other poorly drained areas. Its aggressiveness results in its dominance on such areas. 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid (silvex), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, (2,4-D), or 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) applied at 2 lb/A for 2 or more years in succession controlled swainsonpea satisfactorily on cropped land. 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA) was also effective.
10.2307/4040734|Five strains of Johnsongrass [Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers.] in selected and random plantings received repeated foliar applications of 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon). For three characters studied, the residual variance was less with selected plantings than with random plantings. Johnsongrass strains differed in their response to dalapon.
10.2307/4040729|A metabolite of swep [methyl N-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-carbamate] was detected in the straw, hulls and bran layer of rice but not in the polished rice grain (endosperm) or bran oil, using microcoulometric gas chromatography (MCGC). This metabolite was identified as a swep-lignin complex which is quite stable and not extractable from plant tissues by common organic solvents. Upon extraction with HCl-dioxane, a portion of this complex is hydrolyzed to swep and soluble products of lignin. The swep was purified by adsorption chromatography and identified by infrared spectroscopy and microcoulometric gas chromatography retention times. The mechanism of swep-lignin complex formation is considered to be an example of a common detoxification mechanism by plants through immobilization.
10.2307/4040720|Root sections of Canada thistles (Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.) from 10 locations in Montana, Idaho, Washington, and Wyoming were planted at Bozeman, Montana. Leaf margins varied from deeply ruffled and lobed with numerous spines, to entire margins essentially without spines. Flowers varied in color from shades of purple to pale blue and white. Seed size ranged from 300,000 to 673,000 seeds per pound. The earliest ecotype emerged about 2 weeks before the latest and shoot and flower development and height of plants were varied.
10.2307/4040725|Naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino s-triazine (atrazine) were applied to Chlorella pyrenoidosa in an attempt to characterize mathematically the growth inhibition responses obtained. (Chlorella was found to serve well as a test organism.) Inhibition results induced by NAA and 2,4-D satisfactorily supported the hypothesis inherent in the kinetic interpretation. Results with atrazine were most satisfactorily interpreted by a probit analysis which showed large differences in rate of toxicity between high and low concentrations. This difference is thought to be responsible for the poor fit to a straight line in the reciprocal plots of the kinetic analysis. It is assumed that growth inhibition by atrazine resulted from a blocking of the photosynthetic process.
10.2307/4040736|Bioassay methods are described for determining the concentration of 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid in solutions and in soil. These methods are suitable for determining the concentration of the herbicide in the presence of other herbicides. These test methods can detect considerably less than one microgram of herbicide.
10.2307/4040721|Seed dormancy in velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medic.) was due primarily to an impermeable seed coat. Embryo dormancy was not a factor in the occurrence or maintenance of seed dormancy. The presence of germination inhibitors was indicated, but their role in seed dormancy appeared limited. The termination of dormancy under field conditions was considered to result from naturally occurring fractures in the seed coat. The point of fracture was always in the region of the chalazal slit and was considered to follow intense drying under natural conditions. Drying seed in laboratory experiments produced the same fractures in seed coats.
10.2307/4040731|Sorghum grain yield losses in Northwest and Central Texas caused by uncontrolled weed growth varied from 8 to 41%. Under high moisture conditions, sorghum competed best with weeds when planted thickly in narrow rows. With less moisture, seeding in wide rows resulted in more effective competition. If rains produced weed germination immediately after planting, competition with the sorghum was more severe than when weeds germinated 1 or 2 months after sorghum planting. Several mechanical weed control methods were very successful.
10.2307/4041096|Recrystallized 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron), 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron), 3-phenyl-1,1-dimethyl-urea (fenuron), 1-n-butyl-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methylurea (neburon), 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine), 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine), 5-bromo-3-isopropyl-6-methyluracil (isocil), and 5-bromo-3-sec-butyl-6-methyluracil (bromacil) were deposited in thin layers on aluminum planchets, irradiated with far, middle, and near ultraviolet light and collected in ethanol. Spectral changes in the ultraviolet region and losses were determined spectrophotometrically. The greatest changes and losses occurred with far ultraviolet and the least with near ultraviolet irradiation. Little or no spectral changes occurred in the dark, but there was some loss of each herbicide.
10.2307/4041090| It was shown that less sprouting of blue oak (Quercus douglasii) and California black oak (Q. kelloggii) occurred when treated stumps were (a) cut 30 cm rather than 90 cm high, (b) treated at once after cutting rather than after 7 days, (c) treated with 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) amine rather than with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) amine, and (d) left uncovered rather than covered. The differences between treatments eventually disappeared because of the death of the sprouts, possibly due to the levels of herbicide used in making the treatments. The downward movement of carboxyl C-labeled 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole-5-C, and C-labeled urea in interior live oak (Q. wislizenii) stumps was studied. Rainfall, level of 2,4-D applied, and time interval all appeared to influence downward movement. 
10.2307/4041091|Dicamba (dimethylamine salt of 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid) followed slightly behind the forward penetration of added water in both loam and sandy loam soils. Dicamba persisted longer than 2,4-D butyl ester in autoclaved and not-autoclaved loam and sandy loam soils. Tartary buckwheat, Fagopyrum tataricum (L.) Gaertn. planted at intervals in the autoclaved soils showed no injury from the 2,4-D at 16 oz/A after 4 weeks but was completely killed by dicamba at 8 oz/A after 12 weeks of incubation. In the not-autoclaved soils there was no visible effect on the buck-wheat plants from 2,4-D after 2 weeks but nearly all of the plants were killed by dicamba after 12 weeks of incubation. Oxygen consumption in the loam soil was greatly reduced by dicamba at concentrations of 10,000 ppm or higher. Similar concentrations of 2,4-D butyl ester had only a slight and sometimes no effect on oxygen uptake. These concentrations are well in excess of those suggested for selective weed control in grain crops.
10.2307/4041087|The following surfactants were prepared at various concentrations in distilled water, with and without 3% W/V technical or formulated 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon): anionic-Vatsol OT (sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate), sodium lauryl sulfate; nonionic-Dynawet (chemistry undisclosed), X-77 (alkylarylpolyoxyethylene glycols, free fatty acids and isopropanol), Tween 20 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate), Tween 80 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate), T-1947 (polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene polyols). Contact angles on paraffin coated plexiglas and corn leaf surfaces correlated well with surface tension measurements. With solutions having surface tensions of 31 dynes/cm or less, leaf wetting was complete. Although surfactants differed considerably in their influence on surface tension and wetting, all markedly enhanced herbicidal activity, increasingly with rate. The superiority of Vatsol OT as a surface tension reducer and wetting agent was confirmed. Vatsol OT alone was toxic to corn at 0.5% concentration and higher; T-1947 and sodium lauryl sulfate produced early injury symptoms at 5.0% but caused no lasting effect; all other surfactants were nontoxic at all concentrations used. Minimum surface tensions and contact angles occurred at 0.1-0.5% concentration for all surfactants. However, maximum herbicidal activity was observed at ten times these levels or greater. Thus above 0.1-0.5% surfactant concentration herbicidal enhancement was not correlated with surface tension lowering, contact angle, observed wettability or initial toxicity of the surfactants. This confirms the view that herbicide-surfactant-plant surface interactions, more specific than mere increased wetting, are a part of total surfactant action.
10.2307/4041093|Nemaha oats and 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben) were effective in reducing weed growth during sweetclover establishment. Hubam and Madrid sweetclover, as well as Nemaha oats, were tolerant of amiben rates necessary for annual weed control. Second-year Madrid sweetclover hay yields were increased from amiben applications the previous year.
10.2307/4041095|Giant foxtail (Setaria faberii Herrm.) was grown from seed in controlled climate rooms at temperatures of 50, 60, 70, and 80 F and photoperiods of 8, 12, 16, and 20 hours. An inherently poor primary root system resulted in slow and uniform growth during the first few weeks under all environmental conditions. Giant foxtail produced the most dry matter at the highest temperatures and longest photoperiods. No photoperiod inhibited flowering but photoperiod produced differences in development of inflorescences. Within any temperature, the longer the photoperiod the greater the size of panicle and number of seeds produced. Seed viability was high at 80 and 70 F, low at 60 F and zero at 50 F within all photoperiods.
10.2307/4041100|Giant foxtail (Setaria faberii Herrm.) germinated, emerged, and produced panicles containing viable seeds when sown during the greater part of the growing season. The height of the plant, size of panicle, and number of seeds produced depended on date of planting. Cutting to 2 inches at various stages of growth did not prevent further growth and reflowering but reduced the size of the panicle and the number of seeds. Mowing in May and June allowed giant foxtail to produce two crops of viable seeds.
10.2307/4041097| The extent of adsorption of five C-labeled s-triazines, 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine), 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine), 2-chloro-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (propazine), 2-methoxy-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (prometone), and 2,4-bis(isopropylamino)-6-methylmercapto-s-triazine (prometryne) from aqueous solutions by soil constituents was expressed as a distribution coefficient (Kd), which is the ratio of the amount of herbicide adsorbed to the amount in the equilibrium solution. The Kd value for a given s-triazine and exchanger remained relatively constant over a range of concentrations. The adsorption reaction was essentially at equilibrium within 1 hour. Increasing the temperature and pH resulted in decreased adsorption of simazine and atrazine. The order of increasing adsorption of these compounds by soils was propazine, atrazine, simazine, prometone and prometryne. Increased amounts of organic matter and/or clay in a soil generally were associated with increased adsorption of these s-triazines. No adsorption of simazine or atrazine was detected with kaolinite. Putnam clay, illite, and montmorillonite were increasingly adsorptive in that order. The organic materials were generally much more adsorptive than the clays. The adsorption reaction was reversible by increasing temperatures, water elution, and elution with various organic solvents. Fifty percent ethanol plus heat was very effective in eluting the chloro-s-triazines from soil. 
10.2307/4041094|Some seeds of Cicuta douglasii (DC.) Coult. & Rose (western waterhemlock), Cuscuta planiflora Tenore (smallseed dodder), Cuscuta indecora Choisy (largeseed dodder), Linaria dalmatica Mill. (Dalmatian toadflax), Asclepias speciosa Torr. (showy milkweed), and Halogeton glomeratus (M. Bieb.) C. A. Mey (halogeton) (brown seeds) still germinated after 12 months of submergence at 12- and 48-inch depths in canal water. Black seeds of halogeton were not viable after 6 months. In another test, 35 percent of the seeds of Polygonum persicaria L. (ladysthumb) remained firm and 24 percent germinated after 5 years. Seeds of Cichorium intybus L. (chicory) and Swainsona salsula (Pall.) Taub. (swainsonpea) were not decomposed and devitalized in toto until after 5 years. No seeds of Avena fatua L. (wild oat), Bassia hyssopifolia (Pall.) Kuntze (fivehook bassia), and Rumex crispus L. (curly dock) sprouted after 6, 18, and 42 months, respectively. No seeds of Salsola kali L. var. tenuifolia Tausch (Russian thistle) and few seeds of Sonchus arvensis L. (perennial sowthistle) germinated after 3 months.
10.2307/4041102|Silvex, [2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid], impregnated (20% ae) on clay granules, applied at a rate as low as 20 lb/A ae gave excellent control of well-rooted alligatorweed [Alternanthera philoxeroides (Mart.) Grieb] growing in less than 18 inches of water. The 2-ethylhexyl ester of silvex was more effective than the potassium salt. Silvex was not effective on floating-mat alligatorweed or in water over 18 inches deep.
10.2307/4041088|Herbicidal rates (5 to 9 lb/A) of 2-chloroallyl diethyldithiocarbamate (CDEC) retarded emergence of head lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) reduced both pre- and postthinning plant populations, caused injury symptoms in young plants, affected the subsequent rate of growth, date of maturity, weight of marketable heads, and yield. Decreased yields were attributed to a reduction in plant population, poor head solidity, and small head development. Reductions in yield were in proportion to dosage and of economic importance.
10.2307/4041104| Diquat (6,7-dihydropyrido[1,2-a:2,1-c] pyrazidiinium salt) was applied to several emergent, submersed, floating-leaved, and free-floating aquatic plants common in Central Illinois ponds. At relatively low rates, it was effective in controlling several submersed aquatic plants but not American pondweed, Potamogeton nodosus, and cabomba, Cabomba caroliniana. This herbicide also was effective on several common emergent species. 
10.2307/4041098|During a 2-year study corn exhibited relatively good tolerance to flaming at a speed of 4 mph. Soybeans were more susceptible to injury by flaming at early growth stages than was corn. For weed control conventional cultivation and preemergence herbicides were superior to flaming. Damage to crop or weeds was influenced by morphology of the plant, size of plant, adjustment of equipment, number of flamings, and speed or length of exposure. This study suggests that flame cultivation would not be very competitive in areas where preemergence herbicides and conventional cultivation give satisfactory control of weeds. Although cost of gas would be about equal to cost of herbicide, cost of flame cultivation equipment is about five times greater, and flame cultivation would require 2 to 4 more trips over the field. Flame cultivation may have more potential in the drier areas where preemergence herbicides have been less effective.
10.2307/4041084|The effects of various rates of 7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-dicarboxylic acid (endothall), isopropyl N-phenylcarbamate (IPC), and 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (dicamba) on Bromus tectorum L. (downy brome) on four soils with surface litter and incorporated organic matter treatments were studied. Significant differences were found in reaction of downy brome seedlings to the herbicides in the four soils. The soil with the highest organic matter content generally inhibited herbicide action to the greatest extent. Straw mulch alone caused a significant decrease in growth of downy brome seedlings. Action of IPC was most inhibited by straw, and endothall the least.
10.2307/4041082|A 7-year ecological study of natural infestations of globe-podded (Cardaria pubescens) and lens-podded (C. chalapensis) hoary cresses was conducted under conditions of irrigation and dry land farming in southern Saskatchewan. Density and area measurements were compared annually in competition with grasses, forbs and shrubs in several environments. The hoary cresses are well adapted to moist situations but are not particularly vigorous in dry, semi-arid environments. Globe-podded hoary cress was better able to survive a period of drought than the lens-podded species. Native roses (Rosa spp.), western snowberry (Symphoricarpos occidentalis) and Russian knapweed (Centaurea repens) were the most effective competitors of the hoary cresses. Alfalfa and to a lesser degree, bromegrass were also effective. As these infestations of hoary cress are situated upstream from the Saskatchewan River Irrigation Project, they constitute a serious threat to many acres of irrigable farmland. Control by cultural means is shown to be feasible.
10.2307/4041086|Germination of dormant crabgrass seed, Digitaria ischaemum (Schreb.) Muhl. and D. sanguinalis L., was increased by treatment with the nematocides 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane and ethylene dibromide.
10.2307/4041106| A chromatographic method with silver nitrate reagent detected dalapon extracted from quackgrass (Agropyron repens (L.) Beauv.) rhizomes. Minimum detectable quantity was 210 grams. Following field applications of dalapon, the amounts recovered 1 hour after spraying were low for plots receiving 4 lb/A while relatively high amounts were found initially from 8 lb and 12 lb/A treatments, but several days later, these relations were reversed. 
10.2307/4041083|Early spring or late fall treatments of 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile (dichlobenil) were effective for the control of several annual and perennial sedges, grasses, and broadleaf weeds in cranberry bogs. Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate (CIPC) 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 2,4-D and 2-chloro-4,6-bis (ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) as spring applications were less effective than dichlobenil for the wide spectrum of weeds encountered. Single spring applications of as much as 4 lb/A of dichlobenil, 6 lb/A of 2,4-D, 24 lb/A of CIPC, and 2 lb/A of simazine were tolerated by the cranberry vines. Dichlobenil at 4 and 6 lb/A caused reductions in upright growth and fruit size. Keeping quality of mature fruit was not adversely affected by herbicidal rates of any of the materials.
10.2307/4041092|A study was conducted to determine the effects of five densities each of rough pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), green foxtail (Setaria viridis (L.) Beauv.), and combinations of the two upon sugar beet yields, top weights, percent sucrose, and total vegetation weights. Green foxtail was less competitive per plant than rough pigweed. Foxtail densities of less than one plant per beet did not reduce beet yields significantly. Rough pigweed alone or combined with green foxtail reduced the beet root yields significantly at all densities in this study. Root yields were reduced 80 percent by two pigweeds and two foxtails per sugar beet. Beet top weights were consistently higher than those of the roots and were reduced approximately in proportion to those of the roots by the various weed densities. The diameter and length of the sugar beets were significantly reduced by competition, the diameter being more affected than the length. The percent sucrose of sugar beets was not affected by weed competition.
10.2307/4041099|The phytotoxicities of three phenylurea herbicides applied annually to cotton at rates used for selective weed control were studied in irrigated soils of the southwestern United States. Yields of seed cotton were generally not affected by annual applications of 3-(p-chlorophenyl-1)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron) and 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron). Annual applications of 3-phenyl-1,1-dimethylurea (fenuron) often reduced seed cotton yields. Mild chlorosis of foliage of cotton seedlings was occasionally observed when monuron was used annually. Although diuron affected the growth of oats and barley 6 to 12 months after application, it caused no adverse effect on cotton seedlings. Monuron residues affected barley and oats more severely than did diuron residues. Accumulation of diuron and monuron from annual applications at rates used for selective weed control in cotton appears unlikely.
10.2307/4041107|The acid and amine formulations of 2,4-dichorophenoxy-acetic acid (2,4-D) can be extracted from soybean seed simultaneously or separately. The method consists of partitioning first between ethyl ether and citrate-phosphate buffer and then between carbon tetrachloride and citrate-phosphate buffer. Quantitative determination of the 2,4-D can be made by means of chromatography.
10.2307/4041089| Metabolic incorporation of adenine-2- by Saccharomyces cerevisiae was examined for alterations produced by 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole) and histidine. The radioactivity recovered from cells after a 4-hour incubation was found predominantly in ethanol-insoluble components (nucleic acids and proteins) of untreated cultures. Amitrole inhibited incorporation of C into insoluble components. Carbon-labeled imidazoleglycerol phosphate, a precursor of histidine, and labeled imidazoleglycerol accumulated in the ethanol-soluble fraction of amitrole treated cells. Imidazoleglycerol accumulated in the external medium. Histidine prevented C incorporation into the hot trichloroacetic acid-insoluble residue (protein), prevented amitrole-induced imidazoleglycerol and imidazoleglycerol phosphate accumulation, and circumvented amitrole inhibition of C incorporation into the hot trichloroacetic acid-soluble (nucleic acids) fraction. 
10.2307/4041105|3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben) and N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) were applied to soybeans and 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) and 2-chloro-N, N-diallylacetamide (CDAA) to corn as sprays and as granules. Except where excellent weed control was established by the herbicides, rotary hoeing 2 weeks after application of the herbicides usually improved the degree of weed control without any detrimental effect on performance of the herbicides.
10.2307/4041101| Methionine-methyl-C administered to seedling tissue produces radioactive polymers consisting primarily of protein. Formation of polymer was inhibited within half an hour in susceptible species by 1, 10, and 50 ppm concentrations of isopropyl N-phenylcarbamate (IPC), isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamate (CIPC), methyl N-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)carbamate (swep), and 4-chloro-2-butynyl N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamate (barban). Resistance to inhibition varied with plant species, and was in accord with previously observed responses in field work. Inhibition of amino acid utilization may be a fundamental cause of carbamate phytotoxicity. Formation of material tentatively described as lignin is also inhibited. 
10.2307/4041103| Cotton plants were treated with C-ring-labeled 2-methylmercapto-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (prometryne) which was soil-incorporated or placed in solution cultures. C-labeled material accumulated in the lysigenous glands of roots, stems and leaves. No evolution of C-carbon dioxide could be detected. Unaltered C-prometryne was present in stems and leaves 23 weeks after treatment, but no radioactive materials could be detected in the seed. Small amounts of hydroxypropazine were isolated from the stems and leaves of plants grown in soil, but none was detected in plants grown in solution culture. Both water-soluble and acetone-insoluble radioactive materials accumulated in the leaves, stems and roots of all treated plants. 
10.2307/4041085|The growth and development of newly-planted red tart cherry trees on a silt loam soil were satisfactory following six annual treatments of 2.5, 5, and 10 lb/A of 2-chloro-4,6-bis (ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) or 2.5 lb/A of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1, 1-dimethylurea (diuron). Measurements of tree diameter and leaf area gave no evidence of injury. The control of annual and perennial weeds was excellent. In survey experiments, trees which received 80 lb/A of simazine in 4 years were not injured, but 160 lb/A in 4 years produced leaf injury in the fourth and fifth years.
10.2307/4040898|Greenhouse evaluation of 13 herbicides indicated that several were suitable for preemergence weed control in sesame. CIPC appeared best and was field evaluated for 2 years. This herbicide provided adequate to excellent annual weed control without plant injury or reductions in yield.
10.2307/4040882|Watering with 1 surface cm or more following spray treatment with dicamba (2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid) and picloram (4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid) markedly increased inhibition of shoot growth from rhizome sections of quackgrass (Agropyron repens (L.) Beauv.) and bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss). Shoots were most sensitive to the herbicides at early stages of development. Bromegrass and quackgrass were about equally susceptible to the two herbicides. Uptake through roots or rhizomes was more effective than foliar uptake. Kentucky bluegrass in established sod was not injured by dosages of the two herbicides that killed or controlled quackgrass. Young stands of Kentucky bluegrass were more sensitive.
10.2307/4040879|The substituted urea herbicides were rated according to their effectiveness as aquatic herbicides in this order: diuron [3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea], monuron [3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea], neburon [1-butyl-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methlyurea] and TCA (trichloroacetic acid) mixtures with them. They showed greatest potential in controlling certain aquatic plants in preemergence and early postemergence applications. However, relatively high concentrations were required to control filamentous algae (Cladophora, Pithophora and Spirogyra), chara (Chara), coontail (Ceratophyllum), naiad (Najas), and pondweeds (Potamogeton) for periods of time exceeding three months and up to three years. Granular formulations achieved better distribution of herbicides for control of rooted aquatic plants along the margins of lakes and ponds. Wettable powder and liquid emulsifiable concentrates were superior to granular formulations for the control of algae and emergent or floating aquatic plants. Monuron and fenuron were less toxic to fish than were diuron and neburon. The TCA mixtures were somewhat more toxic than the simple ureas. Some species of fish were more sensitive than others and fingerlings more sensitive than adults of the same species. Fish-food organisms were reduced appreciably in plastic enclosures at herbicidal concentrations.
10.2307/4040893| (Arbutus menziesii Pursh.) trees in the field (15-20 cm diameter) xyacetic acid (2,4-D*) and 2,4-5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T*) in blue oak (Quercus douglasii H. & A.) seedlings occurred following application of these herbicides to cuts made through the bark into the wood of stems. Downward transport was limited. C-labeled 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole*), maleic hydrazide (MH*), urea*, and P-labeled phosphate translocated extensively into the roots as well as upward into the shoots. High humidity had little effect on translocation of 2,4-D* and 2,4,5-T* into the roots, but had marked effect on translocation of amitrole*, MH*, and urea*. The addition of herbicidal amounts of unlabeled 2,4-D or 2,4,5-T reduced translocation of labeled compounds into the roots. Unlabeled 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram) or 2,4-D applied to cuts prevented translocation into the roots of all but traces of MH* applied to the same cuts. Treatment of blue oak or madrone (Arbutus menziesii Pursh.) trees in the field (15-20 cm diameter) with herbicidal doses of 2,4-D or picloram largely inhibited the downward movement of PO applied to the same cuts at all stages of growth; such interference was less pronounced in madrone than in blue oak. 
10.2307/4040880|In greenhouse studies, Johnsongrass [Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers.] seedlings were killed when the first internode passed through treated soil. Shoots from rhizomes were not killed, but lateral root development was inhibited on that stem portion in contact with treated soil. Trifluralin may control Johnsongrass seedlings, but it is not likely that it will be useful in the control of established stands.
10.2307/4040878| Seedbed preparation was completed about October 15, just before the fall rains. Four herbicide treatments, 1,1-dimethyl-4,4-bipyridinium salt (paraquat), 6,7-dihydrodipyrido(1,2-a:2,1-c)pyrazidiinium salt (diquat), isopropyl N-phenylcarbamate (IPC) + butoxyethanol ester of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole + ammonium thiocyanate (amitrole-T) were successfully applied before Janaury 15 for control of weeds and volunteer crop plants. Grasses for seed production were sown in March without disturbing the soil. An application of paraquat at seeding greatly increased subsequent seed yields. Little additional germination of contaminating weed grasses occurred after the grasses were planted and they became established rapidly. By the following October most species could be treated with 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron) to control winter annual weeds. Where weeds were thus effectively controlled during the establishment period, excellent stands resulted which produced high yields of weed-free seed in the first year of seed production. 
10.2307/4040902|Potato fields were surveyed semi-monthly. Seedlings of barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crusgalli (L.) Beauv.) began to emerge as soon as the potatoes or shortly after. Emergence continued throughout the growing season. Barnyardgrass plants were most noticeable in the field in August and September when the potato vines started to lodge and much of the grass was headed.
10.2307/4040890|Tissue abnormalities in colonial bentgrass (Agrostis tenuis Sibth.) were observed after foliage applications at normal doses of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 2-(2, 4, 5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid (silvex), or 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-butyric acid [4-(2,4-DB)]. They included proliferations of the pericycle, hypertrophic cortical cells, and massed lateral root and root hair formations. The abnormalities usually resulting from phenoxy rates of 1, 1-1/2, or 3 pounds active per acre were often followed by death of the bentgrass within 20 days after treatment.
10.2307/4040891|Studies in New Mexico showed basal and stump applications of ester and oil-soluble amine formulations of 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid (silvex) to be effective for control of saltcedar (Tamarix pentandra Pall.). Trees with trunks 2 inches or larger in diameter were harder to kill than smaller trees and retreatment was often needed. Spraying the lower 2 feet was no more effective than spraying the lower foot. Cutting the larger trees and spraying the stump increased effectiveness.
10.2307/4040883| P was injected into the soil at specific locations to allow determination of the phosphorus uptake pattern of Phaseolus vulgaris (snap bean), Amaranthus retroflexus (pigweed), and Setaria viridis (green foxtail). All species absorbed phosphorus primarily from the top 6 inches of soil. Bean absorbed phosphorus from a zone of relatively small volume. Pigweed roots showed the greatest amount of lateral spread and foxtail roots the deepest soil penetration. One, two, three, or four plants of each of the above-mentioned species were grown 6 inches from a test bean plant to evaluate the effects of associated plants on the phosphorus uptake of the test bean. The effects observed were quite different for the three species studied. 
10.2307/4040895| Mature yellow foxtail [Setaria glauca (L.) Beauv.] infestations, growing in rows of corn, were harvested in 3 foot segments from paired 30 foot rows of corn. Basic analyses of variance were calculated so that the variances of plot sizes involving multiples of 3 feet could be determined and compared. Precision indices were calculated for harvesting various fractions of the plot area. Loss of precision did not exceed 25 percent when only 40 percent of the total area was harvested in random samples of 1-row  3 feet, or in multiples of this basic unit. Practical implications of the findings are related to estimates of weed yields in crop-weed ecology studies and herbicide evaluation tests. 
10.2307/4040901|Whenever moisture and temperature were favorable for germination, new seedlings of field dodder (Cuscuta campestris Yunck.) emerged each week for two years after seeding in the field or greenhouse. Many viable seeds probably remained in the soil, because 10% or less of the seeds produced seedlings.
10.2307/4040876|Combinations of row spacings, tillage, and herbicides were evaluated on Clark soybeans grown on Mexico silt loam. Weeds were not always completely controlled with 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben) or sodium pentachlorophenate (PCP). When herbicides were used, soybeans in 20- and 24-inch rows usually needed no more than one cultivation, while those in 32- and 40-inch rows usually needed at least one and sometimes two cultivations for good weed control and high soybean yields. Soybeans in narrow rows always equalled and sometimes produced higher yields than those in wide rows. The soybean canopy covered the ground more rapidly in narrow rows than in wide rows so that when herbicides suppressed early weed growth, less weeds were produced in narrow rows than in wide rows. In some situations, cultivations increased soybean yields when few or no weeds were present.
10.2307/4040888|Giant foxtail (Setaria faberii Herrm.) was seeded the day the crop was planted and 3, 6, 9, and 12 weeks later. Foxtail that began growing with the crop and was left to maturity reduced corn yields 13% and soybean yields 27%. Foxtail seeded 3 weeks or later after the crop was planted did not cause yield reductions in corn or soybeans. Although not competitive, foxtail seeded 3 weeks after corn was planted produced 500 pounds of dry matter per acre, and all seedlings in corn produced seed. Soybeans produced more shade than corn, and foxtail from the 3-week or later seedings in soybeans produced little or no dry matter or seed.
10.2307/4040903| Treatment of little barley (Hordeum pusillum Nutt.) at early-tillering stages with 0.25 to 0.5 lb/A of 1,1-dimethyl-4,4-dipyridylium cation paraquat, surfactant gave satisfactory to complete control of little barley and other annual weed species. Except under unfavorable seasonal conditions, atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine) also gave good control of little barley but was ineffective against other established weed species. Coastal bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L) Pers.] was not injured by atrazine and only temporarily by paraquat. 
10.2307/4040887| Exposures of trifluralin, , -trifluoro-2,6-dinitro-N,N-dipropyl-p-toluidine, coated on glass and soil surfaces were made to sunlight and to artificial light from a mercury-vapor source having a wavelength range of 300-700 millimicrons. Ultraviolet absorption spectra of irradiated samples exhibited progressive change with time and intensity of exposure. Exposures on a glass surface to sunlight for four to six hours resulted in a decrease in the plant growth inhibitory activity of trifluralin. Exposures on soil surfaces also indicated that photodegradation occurs, but at a much reduced rate. 
10.2307/4040897|Factors influencing injury to oats from 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) and 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) residues in the soil were studied over a period of five years. Initial rate of triazine application was highly important with significant injury in about one-half of the trials on plots treated with 2 lb/A the year prior to planting oats, and on all plots treated at 4 lb/A. No material difference was found on plots treated with equivalent rates of atrazine and simazine. Granular preparations of atrazine left a residue that was more injurious than wettable powders. Disking the seedbed for oats, rather than plowing, resulted in greater injury. Cultivation of the corn between the rows after treatment did not influence the injury the following year. Soil type did not have a marked effect on injury in this study. Above-normal average mean air temperatures appeared to reduce injury the following year in some instances. Experiments initiated in years of abundant rainfall during April to October tended to have less injury the next year than experiments initiated in years when rainfall was limited.
10.2307/4040889|There were usually no significant differences in weed and crop yields between plots receiving aerial and ground applications of herbicides. Where differences were found, aerial application was the more effective.
10.2307/4040881| The preemergence herbicide N, N-dimethyl-2, 2-diphenylacetamide (diphenamid) alone and in combination with the contact herbicides 1,1-dimethyl-4, 4-bipyridinium salt (paraquat) and 3, 4-dichloropropionanilide (propanil) was studied over three years. Application at planting and crop emergence (delayed preemergence) were compared. Weed control and crop tolerance were equally effective at either stage in tomatoes. Delayed preemergence applications of contact materials alone were erratic as herbicides but were more effective in peppers than in tomatoes. At emergence, combinations were more effective. Selectivity of propanil lessened when the cotyledons of tomato expanded fully. 
10.2307/4040899|Six herbicides were applied to young stands of Kentucky bluegrass at weekly intervals in treatments beginning 5, 7, 9 and 11 weeks after seeding bluegrass. In both years the arsenical containing herbicides were effective when applications were started 7, 9 or 11 weeks after seeding. Applications started five weeks after seeding were unsuccessful in 1962 but gave excellent control in 1963. Reduced stands of Kentucky bluegrass and generally poorer crabgrass control were obtained with phenyl mercuric acetate than with the arsenicals.
10.2307/4040900|Dodder seedlings become attached to another plant by first twining about some part of the host. Twining is dependent on action of light. Chlorophyll also forms after exposure to light. Diuron [3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea] was applied to dodder seedlings to determine the nature of light action in twining. Diuron had no effect on twining but blocked photosynthesis.
10.2307/4040892|In 1:1 slurry, adsorption of 2-chloro-4,6-bis (ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) by acid soils from saturated solution varied from 13 to 90%. Percent of adsorption from more dilute solutions was approximately that from the saturated solution. The adsorption of simazine by 18 soils was not correlated significantly with soil pH, but was correlated significantly with percent clay and highly significantly with organic matter and titratable acidity. Simazine was considered to be adsorbed by soils by proton association. Using titratable acidity as a measure of H-soil, equilibrium constants were calculated which did not vary greatly as a result of changes in acidity up to pH 8.5, or as a result of concentration of simazine in the added solution. Leon, the most adsorptive of the tested soils, gave values for the equilibrium constant that were somewhat higher than for four other soils. Simazine penetrated more deeply into limed soil than into unlimed soil. Liming reduced the decomposition of simazine as did intermittent drying. Recovery decreased with time.
10.2307/4040886| The atomization of jet streams from circular orifices, 279, 483, and 1016 microns in diameter, was measured under operating pressures less than 5 psi. The jet streams disintegrated into uniform large drops approximately twice the diameter of the jet orifice, and small drops making up less than 1% of the liquid volume from the small jet. About 80% of the spray from a jet discharging horizontally was deposited in a band 2 inches wide. The distribution pattern of horizontal jet streams positioned on a 2 inch spacing was improved by angling the jet streams 10-15 from the direction of travel. 
10.2307/4040896| Linuron (3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methoxy-1-methylurea) and diphenamid (N,N-dimethyl-2,2-diphenylacetamide) were applied at 5 and 25 lb/A to 13-  3-inch columns of Wheeling sandy loam and Maury silt loam soils and leached with 1, 2, 4, and 8 inches of water. Linuron remained at or near the soil surface; diphenamid was leached more readily. 
10.2307/4040884|A 4-year study was made at Huntley, Montana. When the seed coats were ruptured, 100% germination of sago pondweed (Potomogeton pectinatus L.) seeds occurred. Tubers grow in soil to a depth of 18 inches. Formation of tubers was greatest in August. Single plants of sago pondweed, grown from a tuber and a seed, in 6 months developed over 36,000 tubers and 63,000 seeds, respectively. Tubers survived winter temperatures well when buried in the soil. When dipped in paraffin tubers survived up to four years in storage.
10.2307/4040877|Maximum castorbean (Ricinus communis L.) yields were obtained from combinations of chemical and mechanical treatments. The rotary hoe controlled weeds when used preemergence and during the early stages of crop growth. The flame cultivator gave preemergence weed control and was selective on weeds less than four to five inches tall after castorbeans had attained a height of 12 to 14 inches. The cultivator controlled weeds between castorbean rows, but weeds were occasionally found within the row. 2-Chloroallyl diethyldithiocarbamate gave unsatisfactory preemergence weed control. Ethyl N,N-dipropylthiolcarbamate (EPTC) gave excellent weed control, injured castorbeans at 3 lb/A, but not at 2 lb/A. N-1-naphthylpthalamic acid at 4 lb/A gave good early weed control.
10.2307/4040885| On three soils, 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben) at 1.5 and 15 ppmw did not inhibit the nitrifying microflora, but 150 and 1500 ppmw significantly reduced the nitrate nitrogen produced by the soil microflora. No breakdown of amiben in liquid media was detected during 70 days. Amiben had a net minus charge in solution, and traveled at about the same rate on paper strips in electrophoresis as the dye brilliant blue. The organic matter content of soil was the property most closely associated with adsorption of C-labeled amiben. Only kaolinite, of four clays studied, adsorbed amiben significantly. There was no volatilization of amiben from stainless steel planchets stored at temperatures of 15, 25 or 35 C and relative humidities of 0, 33, 66, or 100 per cent. 
10.2307/4040894|The control of blue oak (Quercus douglasii H. & A.) was investigated by cut surface applications of water-soluble amine formulations of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T), 2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)propionic acid (2,4-DP), 2-(2,4-5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid (silvex); ester formulations of 2,4,5-T and silvex; potassium salt of 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram); and ammonium sulfamate. All phenoxy herbicides were relatively effective in controlling blue oak; the least favorable results were obtained with undiluted ester forms of 2,4,5-T and silvex, and ammonium sulfamate. Picloram was more effective than the water-soluble amine salts of 2,4-D on both blue oak and madrone (Arbutus mensiesii Pursh). Relatively favorable results were obtained on madrone by single-point applications to stems with picloram. Applications to holes 1 inch deep were more effective than when applied in deeper or shallower holes. Diluting alkanolamine salts of 2,4-D with water and butoxyethanol ester of 2,4,5-T with diesel oil had a generally depressing effect on kill (except for the first dilution of the ester). Plant kill decreased as the diameters of the trees increased. Rainwater analyses did not furnish an explanation for the marked increase in growth of the grass beneath the treated trees.
10.2307/4041155|An apparatus for trapping the vapors of ethyl N,N-dipropylthiolcarbamate (EPTC) and other herbicides froms soils under field conditions is described. The herbicide vapors were collected in cooled traps along with ice crystals, identified by gas chromatography and determined quantitatively. The amount of EPTC lost and trapped in 30 minutes ranged from 22 to 38% of that applied to the surface of six different types of wet soils. The amount lost from dry soils was much less than from moist soils. Letting the surface of six different types of wet soils. The amount lost from dry soils was much less than from moist soils. Letting the surface of freshly worked moist soil dry out to depth of 1/2 inch before spraying with EPTC, greatly reduced the loss by vaporization. Immediate incorporation prevented any loss of EPTC from dry soil and greatly reduced the loss from moist soils. After spraying EPTC on dry soil, sprinkling with small amounts of water increased the loss. Comparison of several thiolcarbamate herbicides showed that n-propyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (R-1607) and n-propyl ethyl-n-butylthiolcarbamate (PEBC) were lost by vaporization at a slower rate than EPTC, and S-ethyl hexahydro-l-Hazepine-l-carbothioate (R-4572) was lost at a much slower rate than the other herbicides tested.
10.2307/4041156|The disappearance of EPTC (ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate) from soils was studied by steam distilling the remaining EPTC from the soil samples and analyzing the distillates. The most important factor affecting the loss of EPTC from soil was the amount of moisture in the soil. During the first 15 minutes after spraying on the soil surface, 20% of the applied EPTC disappeared from dry soil, 27% from moist soil and 44% from wet soil. The loss was 23, 49, and 69% after one day and 44, 68, and 90% after six days on dry, moist, and wet soils, respectively. No significant loss of EPTC occurred the first few hours after applying granular EPTC to dry soil or soil containing 4 to 6% moisture, but on soil at 15% moisture the loss from granules was 60% in two hours. There appeared to be a critical moisture level for each soil, above which large losses of EPTC occurred after application to the surface or after shallow incorporation. Depth of incorporation was the second most important factor in EPTC loss from soils. Incorporation to at least 2 to 3 inches was necessary to prevent large losses of EPTC when light rain or sprinkler irrigation followed treatment. EPTC was lost at a faster rate on sunny days than cloudy days. Increasing the temperature from 32 to 60 F, increased the rate of EPTC vaporization from moist soil but had no effect on the loss from dry soil.
10.2307/4041145|Root moisture extraction profiles varied from 20 square feet for Kochia scoparia (L.) Schrad, (kochia to 44 square feet for Xanthium pennsylvanicum Wallr. (cocklebur). Weeds within the extremes with increasing root moisture extraction profiles were Eragrostis pectinacea (Michx) Ness (tufted lovegrass), Solanum rostratum Dunal. (buffalobur), Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop. (large crabgrass), Tribulus terrestris L. (puncturevine), Salsola kali L., var. tenuifolia Tausch (Russian thistle), Amaranthus palmeri S. Wats. (Palmer amaranth) and sorghum.
10.2307/4041151|Anionic and cationic surfactants differentially enhanced the phytotoxicities of four herbicides to corn and soybeans in relation to variations in their structure. Thirteen ionic and two related nonionic surfactants were studied in sprays containing water-soluble forms of 2,2-dichloropropionic acid [dalapon], 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid [2,4-D], 4,6-dinitro-o-sec-butylphenol [DNBP], and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole [amitrole]. Effects of surfactant structure, type, and concentration on two other spray properties-surface tension and specific conductivity-were measured at three pH conditions. Appreciable enhancement of herbicide toxicities occurred only at the highest concentration, 1.0 g per 100 ml (1.0 percent). With straight-chain isomers of an alkylbenzenesulfonate (ABS) anionic surfactant, enhancement of all herbicides increased as the position of the benzene ring was moved to the mid-chain (C5 and C6) carbons of an n-dodecyl alkyl group. DNBP toxicity to both species and surfactant toxicities to soybeans were increased progressively in separate odd- and even-carbon series, i.e. a C1,3,5-series and a C2,4,6-series. Other ABS variations which provided marked enhancement were use of a highly-branched dodecyl alkyl and substitution of an ester oxygen atom for the benzene ring. Among ethoxylated alkylamine cationic surfactants, variations in alkyl structure affected differentially the toxicities of the various herbicides at alkaline, neutral, and acid pH. Surfactants caused marked modification of physical-chemical properties of sprays in relation to their structure and concentration. However, no one of the properties studied could be correlated consistently with the herbicidal effectiveness of a spray. Results suggested that spray performance of herbicide formulations can be improved by using more effective surfactants to achieve other desired formulation characteristics. The increased toxicity of 2,4-D in certain alkaline sprays also suggested that the conditions necessary for absorption of 2,4-D should be examined more critically.
10.2307/4041150|In greenhouse experiments high levels of phosphorus tended to suppress growth of soybeans, oats, and foxtail in the presence of 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) as compared to controls containing no simazine. However, this relationship was not significant, varying with the soil used in the experiment. Emergence of the seedling was delayed and the concentration of ions in solution increased as phosphorus applications were increased. Mineral uptake by soybean shoots was unaffected by phosphorus or simazine alone, but markedly disrupted in the presence of both simazine and phosphorus. Changes in mineral uptake were typical of effects produced by phosphorus toxicity, indicating that simazine reduced the amount of phosphorus required to produce salt injury.
10.2307/4041161|The morphological symptoms of 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) and 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron) toxicity were expressed in the light but not in the dark. Various wavelengths of narrow band light were produced by the use of colored plastic filters. Oats, var Kanota, and red kidney beans were used. The degree of injury was a function of light intensity, the higher the light intensity the greater the injury. The action spectrum indicated that chlorophyll was the principal absorbing pigment involved in this injury.
10.2307/4041164|A plastic envelope device is described which allows separate exposure of seeds, roots, and coleoptiles of emerging grass seedlings to soil-incorporated herbicides.
10.2307/4041154| Soybeans treated preemergence with carboxyl-labeled C amiben (3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid) were harvested at 7-day intervals. The C activity per gram of dry plant matter decreased with later harvest dates but the activity per plant increased over the period. The cotyledons had considerable radioactivity. Both rates contained the same amount of C amiben but the soybeans exposed to 6 lb/A contained a significantly higher C count than did those exposed to 3 lb/A. All of the identifiable C components were amiben. Most of the activity in soybeans from seed imbibed with C amiben remained in the cotyledons. That which did translocate was evenly distributed. Most (98.1%) of the radioactivity in plants grown in treated nutrient solution remained in the roots. Translocated C amiben appeared about 8 days after exposure and was evenly distributed in the top of the plant. Plant-respired CO had no radioactivity present. 
10.2307/4041143|Preemergence applications of DCPA (dimethyl 2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalate) controlled germinating seedlings of largeseed dodder (Cuscuta indecora Choisy) in alfalfa, and the control continued throughout the season. Applications of DCPA were necessary prior to germination of dodder seed. Under California conditions, applications of DCPA made during early winter (December) provided early season control but not satisfactory control throughout the season as was accomplished with the March treatments. Autoradiographic studies showed only limited movement of tracer in alfalfa plants.
10.2307/4041152|Structural characteristics of surfactants and a herbicide were incorporated in the same molecule by forming longchain alkylamine salts of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid [2,4-D]. In water sprays, all of the 2,4-D salts showed surface activities characteristic of surfactants. The application rate of 2,4-D was held constant at 1/16 lb ae/A; salt concentration was varied by varying spray volume. Seventeen salts were herbicidally active on soybeans at a high concentration (1/16 lb ae in 10 gpa of spray) and a few were also active at a lower concentration (1/16 lb ae in 40 gpa). The remaining thirteen salts were relatively inactive in water. Structural features associated with water-active salts of 2,4-D were those which contribute to hydrophilic characteristics of surfactants. Lipophilic structural features contributed to inactivity in water. The 2,4-D toxicity of fourteen water-active and water-inactive salts of 2,4-D was maximally and equally elicited in one or more of six water and oil spray systems. Differential activities of the salts permitted their classification into six distinct classes-three hydrophilic and three lipophilic. No one of five solution properties-surface tension, interfacial tension, turbidity, specific conductivity, or pH-could be correlated with herbicidal toxicity of a spray. However, a combination of three properties-interfacial tension, turbidity, and specific conductivity-provided some indication of the relative hydrophilic or lipophilic character of a salt and of the 2,4-D toxicity in different sprays. Data suggested that herbicides move into plants by two distinct pathways-one hydrophilic and the other lipophilic.
10.2307/4041160|Alhagi pseudalhagi (Bieb.) Desv. (camelthorn) was in troduced into California about 1915, and into the State of Washington about 1935. Here, it was declared a primary noxious weed in 1955. Seeds scarified with sulfuric acid germinated 90-98 per cent at 25 C. Some seeds were viable after burial one year in soil or submergence for 9 months in running water. Seedlings in the infested area were found only in bovine manure. Tests indicated scarification and transportation of seed in the rumen could accelerate the spread of camelthorn. Lack of favorable moisture and soil temperature at the same time prevented establishment of camelthorn planted at several locations. Eradication resulted from treatment with 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA). Three repeated sprays with esters of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) within a growing season gave control; however, control did not appear to be directly related to depletion of reserve foods in the roots.
10.2307/4041159| S-propyl-1-C-N,N-ethyl n-butylthiolcarbamate (PEBC-C) residue was generally higher in the roots than in the corresponding above-ground portions, and also greater in plants receiving a higher rate of treatment The concentration decreased as a function of time after treatment. The average values of PEBC residue in the fresh foliage, during the first two weeks after receiving a lay-by treatment at blooming stage, were 0.098, 0.465 and 0.860 ppm for 1, 4 and 8 lb/A rates respectively. No PEBC residue was found in fruits from plants receiving any rate of treatment at blooming stage. A small amount of the residue was found in fruits from plants treated at early fruiting stage and this decreased rapidly to zero level after four or five weeks. The metabolic breakdown of PEBC in the tomato foliage and fruits is a first-order process. The rate constant for PEBC breakdown seemed to depend upon the tissue as well as the stage of growth. 
10.2307/4041146|Canada thistle [Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.] infestations were treated with 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron) at 10 rates ranging from 5 to 160 lb/A. Depths to which monuron leached were determined annually by bioassays with flax, peas and wheat. Toxicity at all rates continued for 3 years. The low sand, high clay, and high organic matter contents of this soil combined with cool or dry climatic conditions inhibited leaching and prolonged the toxicity of monuron.
10.2307/4041141|The various descriptive names used in the literature for each bulb type of wild garlic are reviewed and a suggested standard system of bulb nomenclature is presented. The life cycle of the species is briefly reviewed, with emphasis on cycles between plant and bulb types. The morphology, anatomy, ontogeny and physiology of the common bulb types are compared.
10.2307/4041153|Castorbeans (Ricinus communis L.) are extremely tolerant of the rotary hoe. Its timely use plus cultivation gave effective weed control in castorbeans. The preemergence herbicides, used either alone or in combination, that appeared most promising for selective control of weeds in castorbeans were: 2-chloro-N,N-diallylacetamide (CDAA), dimethyl-2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalic acid (DCPA), ethyl N,N-dipropylthiolcarbamate (EPTC), N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA), 2,6-dinitro-N,N-dipropyl-alpha, alpha, alpha-trifluoro-p-toluidine (trifluralin), and propyl dipropylthiolcarbamate (R-1607). The most dependable weed control practice in castorbeans was the use of preemergence herbicides in combination with rotary hoeings plus cultivation.
10.2307/4041144| Mugwort (Ariemisia vulgaris L.) was controlled by soil applications of potassium azide at 100 lb/A and equimolecular amounts of sodium azide in greenhouse studies. Rooted Artemisia plants exposed to exponential concentration ranges of these herbicides in 1/4 strength Knops nutrient solution showed lethal effects at 10 M of either the potassium or sodium azide. Vapors of the potassium and sodium azides caused leaf injury at relatively low rates. Bioassays indicated dissipation of 100 lb/A of the azides in the soil in 6 weeks under greenhouse conditions. 
10.2307/4041157| The sensitivity of giant duckweed (Spirodela polyrhyza (L.) Schleid), common duckweed (Lemna minor L.), Wolffiella floridana (Smith) Thomp., azolla (Azolla caroliniana Willd.), and watermeal (Wolffia columbiana Karst.) to diquat (6, 7-dihydrodipyrido [1,2-a:2,1-c] pyrazidiinium salt) and paraquat (1,1-dimethyl-4,4-bipyridinium salt) was in that order (most to least sensitive). The rapidity of chlorosis in giant duckweed was directly related to the light intensity. The light quality having the most effect on the activity of diquat and paraquat on duckweed was red (600+ millimicrons), and green (510-560 millimicrons) had the least effect. 
10.2307/4041148| The effect of temperature and relative humidity on root and foliar uptake of C-labeled atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine) in quackgrass (Agropyron repens (L.) Beauv.) was studied in a controlled environment growth chamber. Uptake and translocation of root-fed atrazine increased as temperature increased. Greater uptake and translocation of root-fed atrazine occurred under low relative humidity than under high relative humidity. Slightly greater uptake and translocation of foliar-applied atrazine occurred as temperature was increased from 60 to 80 F. 
10.2307/4041162|These herbicides at rates of .01 to .25 lb/A caused moderate to severe morphological effects on soybeans and significant yield reductions. Soybeans treated in the vegetative stage were injured more than those treated in the bloom stage. The herbicide 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid (silvex) injured soybeans most followed by 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-butyric acid (2,4-DB), in that order.
10.2307/4041149|Lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.), redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), and white mustard (Brassica hirta L.) were highly susceptible to 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) regardless of the pretreatment light exposure to which they were subjected. These broadleaved weeds were slightly more susceptible to MCPA applied after a prolonged period of darkness. Neither total carbohydrate, reducing sugar, protein, nor amino acid contents at the time of spraying were associated with the susceptibility of mustard plants to MCPA. Floral bud development on Canada thistle was greatly reduced by MCPA applied at any time of the day to plants 9 and 12 inches tall and was prevented on plants 3 and 6 inches tall. The susceptibility of broadleaved annual weeds and Canada thistle to MCPA was not affected by variations in temperature and humidity at time of spraying.
10.2307/4041158| Downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.) control by 1,1-dimethyl-4,4-bipyridinium salt (paraquat) was increased from 12% without surfactant to 73 to 94% with 17 of 22 surfactants. Paraquat toxicity was greatest at 0.06 and 0.12% surfactant concentrations and decreased at higher concentrations. The less effective surfactants were less water-soluble and more lipophilic than related, more effective ones. 
10.2307/4041142| Combinations of 3-chloro-2-methyl-p-valerotoluidide (solan) with 1,1-dimethyl-4,4-dipyridylium cation (paraquat) were used postemergence in transplanted tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.). Addition of .05 lb/A of paraquat to 2 or 4 lb/A of solan resulted in more effective control of crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop.) than did doubling the rate of solan. The combinations were synergistic on crabgrass but only additive or more often antagonistic on tomato plants. The herbicides dimethyl 2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalate (DCPA) and sodium 2,4-dichlorophenoxyethyl sulfate (sesone) were applied for preemergence weed control in strawberry beds. Velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medic.) was resistant to both DCPA and to sesone, but was quite susceptible to the combination. Combinations of 4,6-dinitro-o-sec-butylphenol (DNBP) with 2-methoxy-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simetone) were highly synergistic on tomato plants. This synergism was more pronounced at low rates of herbicides. 
10.2307/4041147|In greenhouse tests, temperature, humidity, drought stress, and concentration of surfactant influenced the foliar activity of spray mixtures containing a dodecyl ether of polyethylene glycol (Surfactant WK) and 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl urea (diuron) or 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1-methoxy-1-methyl urea (linuron). In comparisons with other commonly used surfactants, Surfactant WK gave a superior performance when used in conjunction with diuron, linuron, and 5-bromo-3-sec-butyl-6-methyl uracil (bromacil). Increased water solubility of these herbicides in the presence of surfactant is only one factor among many involved in the enhanced activity of such combinations. Surfactant WK facilitated the deposition of high concentrations of linuron on leaf surfaces of Johnsongrass. Once a gradient was established, subsequent rapid movement of the herbicide into the leaf was noted.
10.2307/4041140|Toxicity to oats of atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine), simazine (2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine), diuron (3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea), monuron (3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea), and fenuron (3-phenyl-1,1-dimethylurea), exposed to sunlight on soil surface for 25 days was significantly decreased even when surface soil temperatures did not exceed 120 F. Only atrazine and monuron exhibited significantly less phytotoxicity after 60 days exposure than after 25 days. Simazine phytotoxicity also was significantly reduced when held on soil in the dark for 60 days. With the exception of fenuron, there was no difference between treatments within compounds when soil temperatures reached maximums as high as 180 F. Under these conditions, phytotoxicity of the herbicides was reduced 65 to 97 percent by all exposures.
10.2307/4041165|Atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine) and 2-chloro-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (propazine) affected oats and alfalfa in Nebraska planted the year following application to sorghum. No carry-over of 2-chloro-N,N-diallylacetamide (CDAA) + trichlorobenzyl (TCBC) was detected in oats and alfalfa. Intertillage of sorghum did not decrease herbicide residue.
10.2307/4041163|Listed on the basis of visual ratings in Sept. 1961, in the order of increasing toxicity to Kentucky bluegrass sown in April, 1961, and treated May 31 and June 6, the herbicides were 2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalic acid (DCPA), amine methylarsonate, diphenylacetonitrile (diphenatrile), calcium propylarsonate, disodium monomethylarsonate (DMA), N,N-dipropyl-2,6-dinitro-p-toluidine (dipropalin), calcium arsenate, O-(2,4-dichlorophenyl) O-methyl isopropylphosphoramidothioate (DMPA), polychlorodicyclopentadiene isomers, and alpha,alpha,alpha-trifluro-2,6-dinitro-N,N-dipropyl-p-toluidine (trifluralin). All herbicides except DCPA and DMPA (liquid) persisted after two years of use until March 1963 in the top 2 inches of soil.
10.2307/4041030| Doses required to reduce fresh weights of seedling oats 50 percent (ED) in 32 soils were determined for isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamate [CIPC], 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea [diuron], and 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine [simazine]. Physical and chemical properties of soils and the extent of adsorption of the three herbicides on the soils were also determined and evaluated by correlation and multiple regression analysis for usefulness in predicting dose requirements. Extent of adsorption was most closely correlated with ED values for diuron and simazine, but organic matter content was most closely correlated with ED values for CIPC. None of the soil properties nor the extent of adsorption provided consistent predictive value for all of the soils and herbicides studied. 
10.2307/4041042| Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) plants possess a high degree of tolerance to postemergence applications of 3-chloro-2-methyl-p-valerotoluidide (solan). Eggplant (Solanum Melongena L.) is highly susceptible to this herbicide. Differences in penetration, persistence and metabolism of solan by tomato and eggplant were insufficient to account for the differential susceptibility. Solan greatly inhibited the Hill reaction in isolated chloroplasts, and chloroplasts of both species were about equally sensitive to it. Radioactive solan (carbonyl labelled) sprayed on intact tomato and eggplant accumulated to about the same extent in chloroplasts of both species. The Hill reaction in isolated chloroplasts, carbon dioxide (CO) fixation in intact plants, and the level of high energy phosphates in intact plants were determined for tomato and eggplant previously sprayed with a selective rate of solan. Initially, all three reactions were inhibited in both species. Later, all three reactions returned to normal in tomato, but declined to a low level in eggplant. A resistant mechanism of cyclic photosynthetic phosphorylation was proposed as the mechanism of solan tolerance in tomato. Two types of light-activated solan injury were found. A rapid non-selective action, occurring at high doses of the herbicide, killed both tomato and eggplant. A delayed action occurred selectively on eggplant at low rates of herbicide. No solan injury occurred on plants placed in darkness after spraying, regardless of plant species or rate of herbicide applied. 
10.2307/4041027|Downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.), and rattail fescue (Festuca myuros L.) were controlled by 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (dicamba) and 2,4-bis(isoproplyamino)-6-methylmercapto-s-triazine (prometryne). Both herbicides gave 70-100% control when applied soon after the first postharvest irrigation. Dicamba was somewhat less effective when applied before this irrigation. Neither herbicide reduced seed yields when applied before or immediately after the first postharvest irrigation, but both herbicides caused some significant seed yield reductions when treatments were delayed until after considerable crop regrowth had occurred.
10.2307/4041023|Differences in the competitive effects of three major species of foxtail on soybeans were due primarily to differences in the mature plant yields of the species. Giant foxtail (Setaria Faberi) grew more vigorously and caused greater soybean yield reductions than did either yellow foxtail (Setaria lutescens) or green foxtail (Setaria viridis). The competitive effects of velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti) per cwt. of mature weeds were approximately double those of yellow and green foxtail, but produced about the same yield reduction.
10.2307/4041028|Effective chemical control of alligatorweed (Alternanthera philoxeroides (Mart.) Griseb.) has been prevented by rapid regeneration of plants from inactive axillary buds following treatment with herbicides. Destruction of phloem, cambium, and associated parenchyma occurred above and within the nodes of plants treated with 2 lb/A dichlobenil (2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile) or dicamba (2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid). Application of dichlobenil and dicamba in combination increased the extent of tissue destruction. Herbicidal activity was noted within the axillary buds only when vascular strands between bud and stem were well differentiated.
10.2307/4041033| A mitochondrial fraction isolated from cotyledons of etiolated Cucumis sativus L. (Burpee's Improved Long Green) showed respiratory activity roughly comparable to that of other reported plant mitochondrial systems. Published procedures on extraction, centrifugation, and determination of cofactor requirements were modified for this system to obtain maximum activity as measured by Warburg manometry. Succinic dehydrogenase activity in the fraction was inhibited by known inhibitors such as sodium azide, DNP, and hydroxymalonic acid; -ketoglutarate utilization was inhibited by sodium azide. Dichlobenil (2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile) consistently increased respiration (up to 162% of the controls, using 1.45  10 M dichlobenil in a succinate substrate mixture); 2,5-diiodo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile (ioxynil) consistently reduced O uptake at 0.75  10 to 0.75  10 M concentrations. Picloram (4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid) performed in a manner generally similar to the five following substituted benzoic acids: 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA); 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben); 3-nitro-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (dinoben); 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (dicamba); and 2-methoxy-3,5,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (tricamba). Using succinate as substrate, stepwise inhibition occurred in the range of 10 to 10 M herbicide; however, the -ketoglutarate system was much less sensitive to all compounds. For example, the effects of 10 M amiben and dicamba on -ketoglutarate utilization were essentially negligible. Six other herbicides studied showed either no effect or varying degrees of inhibition, depending upon concentration and substrate employed. Dichlobenil uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation at a 1.45  10 M concentration. 
10.2307/4041040| C ring-labeled atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine) was applied in nutrient solutions. Soybeans absorbed more atrazine per g of fresh weight than corn or cotton. The amount of atrazine absorbed by the plants increased with increases in atrazine concentration, in water absorption, and in length of absorption. Less atrazine was absorbed in the second than in the first 24-period with occasional indications of loss of atrazine back into the solution. CO evolution was not established for any plant although many different environmental conditions were tried. Degradation to CO is not a significant process for these plants under these conditions. 
10.2307/4041049| Indoleacetic acid (IAA) stimulates the incorporation of radioactivity derived from methionine-methyl-C into a fraction of sesbania hypocotyl that is insoluble in 80 per cent alcohol or 60 percent acetone, but is soluble in hot water. Incorporation of C into "hot water soluble material" was stimulated by IAA, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 2,5-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, naphthaleneacetic acid, 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid, 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid, 4-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid, and 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid. All compounds were stimulative at 1  10 M. 
10.2307/4041034| Diuron, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea-C moved primarily in the apoplast with the transpiration stream, and did not move with the plant assimilates of red kidney bean, soybean, and barley plants. There did not appear to be a species difference in absorption, distribution, and accumulation. Uptake and distribution increased progressively as duration of treatments increased from 6 hours to 16 days. No phloem movement and distribution was observed in the 16-day treatment time. The addition of a surfactant did not alter the translocation pattern of diuron. The evidence obtained from gross autoradiographs did not eliminate the possibility that very small amounts of diuron may get into the symplast. However, it did indicate that if diuron moved into the symplast, it was restricted and the movement of diuron out of the area of application by phloem was very limited. 
10.2307/4041031| A natural product in corn, the 2-glucoside of 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one, is capable of inactivating triazine herbicides. Two essentially isogenic corn lines, Mississippi selection GT112 (susceptible to atrazine and simazine) and GT112 RfRf (resistant), contained the compound in both roots and shoots. The content of the roots was about equal for the two lines and decreased with age. In shoots of GT112 seedlings 13 to 28 days old, the 2-glucoside content reduced with time to half the original value. In shoots of GT112 RfRf, the 2-glucoside content doubled from 13 to 17 days, then decreased. Shoots of GT112 RfRf contained 1.6, 3.6, and 2.4 times more 2-glucoside at 13, 17, and 28 days, respectively, than GT112. However, 13-day-old homogenized shoots of GT112 converted 1.8 times more atrazine per M of 2-glucoside than GT112 RfRf. Susceptibility of GT112 to triazine herbicides is not due to absence of the 2-glucoside or its inability to convert atrazine. 
10.2307/4041044|Several ring-substituted derivatives of benzoic acid inhibited pantothenate biosynthesis in Escherichia coli. The metabolic site of inhibition was the conversion of ketopantoate to pantoate. This action caused pantothenate-reversible reductions in growth only in strains of E. coli with inherent limited capacities for biosynthesis of ketopantoate. Inhibition of pantothenate biosynthesis was tentatively concluded to be of little physiological significance as a site of action responsible for herbicidal activities of benzoic acids.
10.2307/4041043|Germinable seeds were non-existent below 4 inches in the undisturbed soils used for cranberry bed development. Seeds were found at greater depths in manipulated soils. The seed in the vines used for planting was a major factor in the infestation of a properly scalped bed. Movement of seeds in water caused an infestation of a weed-free bed. The highest movement of seeds per acre-inch of water flow occurred in September, next highest in October and third highest in April. A relatively weed-free planting was maintained through one season by fumigating the soil for seed eradication, erecting a fine mesh screen exclosure to prevent weed invasion by flood water, and washing the vines prior to planting.
10.2307/4041029|Effects of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA) on plant numbers and on the reproductive bulbs were studied by counting plants and digging and examining the bulbs in soil cores. Foliar application of both herbicides resulted in necrosis, reduction in size, growth abnormalities (hardshell bulbs only), changes in the makeup of bulb population, and eventually a large decline in bulb numbers. Soft offset bulbs were damaged less than central bulbs by both herbicides. Soft offset bulbs increased in proportion to total bulb population following 2,3,6-TBA treatment. Both herbicides caused abnormal growth of developing hardshell bulbs and reduced viability. At the 2-lb rate, 2,3,6-TBA reduced hardshell bulb production more than 2,4-D; at 4 lb/A, 2,3,6-TBA prevented hardshell bulb production. Dormant hardshell bulbs of previous seasons' production were not affected by either herbicide. Plant populations declined more rapidly and to a lower level than bulb populations under adverse conditions of environment and herbicide treatments. The slower decline in bulb numbers resulted from dormancy in the hardshell bulbs.
10.2307/4041048|Seedlings of Siberian elm (Ulmus pumila L.) readily invade grasslands of the Southern Plains and are a serious economic problem. Siberian elm was not susceptible to foliage or basal sprays of phenoxy herbicides applied during 3 successive years. Individual trees were killed easily by 1 g (ai) per inch of trunk diameter of 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron) or 3-phenyl-1,1-dimethylurea (fenuron) applied in a ring around the tree. However, the dense population and rapidity of reinvasion make this treatment too expensive.
10.2307/4041032|Enhancement of 3(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron) toxicity to oat plants was not dependent on type-anionic, cationic, or nonionic-of surfactant. However, specific surfactant and concentration were important. Concentrations of surfactant above 0.1% were required for consistent phytotoxic effects. Concentration of diuron in solution at time of application was not an important factor in phytotoxicity. Lowering the temperature from 72 to 60 F slowed the expression of toxicity and increased the chances of plant recovery.
10.2307/4041022|The movement of chemicals in the soil caused by water percolation was treated in a manner analogous to the development of materials through chromatographic columns. A "slotted tube test" was developed, which simulated a miniature field plot, utilizing a chromatographic soil column and the growth of either seeds or an indicator organism in agar as the detector. It was found that the median effective dose was higher for the more strongly sorptive soils. When correlations were made between soil compositions and the corresponding median effective doses for nonionic organic molecules, virtually all of the variations in required dosages were accounted for by percent organic matter and water content. The "active fraction" of organic matter, that fraction concerned with sorption equilibria, appeared to be of the same nature in soils of various compositions from various sources. This provided a technique for calculating the percent "active" organic matter of soil.
10.2307/4041036|Effective control of Artemisia vulgaris L. (mugwort) was obtained with 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid (fenac) and 4-amino-3,5,6-trichloropicolinic acid (picloram). Dimethylamine salt of 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (dicamba) gave control when applied in April when mugwort shoots were small. Dicamba was less effective later in the season even after clipping to obtain small new shoots. The amount of fenac necessary for effective control was reduced by mixing with dicamba, the butoxyethanol ester of 2.4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) or oleyl-1,3-propylenediamine salt of 2,4-D. Late in the season, fenac was more effective when applied after mowing than when applied to large mugwort. Soil incorporated ethyl N,N-dipropylthiolcarbamate and propyl dipropylthiolcarbamate reduced mugwort stands and rhizome weight; however, regrowth occurred in the same season.
10.2307/4041047|At Lincoln 20 lb/A of 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA) destroyed Clark soybeans five seasons after application. Soil persistence of 2,3,6-TBA in the light textured soils and low rainfall of western Nebraska was less than at Lincoln. A 10 lb/A rate of 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron) reduced weed and oat yields at Lincoln the third growing season after its application. Applications of 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine), 2-chloro-4,6-bis-(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine), or monuron at 10 lb/A reduced oat yields at North Platte the third growing season after their application. Herbicide carryover is a greater problem in arid than in humid regions of the United States.
10.2307/4041037|These herbicides for vegetables in three desert areas managed under furrow irrigation exhibited extreme variability between locations in herbicide response and crop toxicity. Some treatments provided a reasonable compromise between weed control and crop injury at any one location, none met this requirement at each location. Soil-type, soil moisture at time of herbicide application, and interaction of crops and environment probably contributed to the observed variability.
10.2307/4041038|Experiments of two types were conducted. (1) Weeds were allowed to grow for different periods after planting sugar beets; they were then removed and the beets hand-weeded until harvest. (2) Sugar beets were hand-weeded for different periods after planting; then no further weeding was done. Weed competition reduced beet yields up to 94%. Weeds that emerged soon after beet planting reduced yields the most, but they exerted little yield-reducing competition until later than 12 weeks after planting the beets (9 weeks after beet emergence). Full-season weed control resulted when beets were hand-weeded for 10 to 12 weeks after planting. Weeds that emerged later were controlled by crop competition.
10.2307/4041046|Herbicides incubated in Wymore silty clay loam soil at field capacity at 15, 25, and 35 C showed 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben) the most persistent, 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA) intermediate, and 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) the least persistent to microbial and/or chemical breakdown. All herbicides persisted much longer at 15 C than at 35 C. The average annual temperature below the plow layer is about 12 C. This helps explain the persistence of leached herbicides under field conditions.
10.2307/4041041|Three thiocarbamate herbicides, S-ethyl dipropylthiocarbamate, S-propyl dipropylthiocarbamate, and S-propyl butylethylthiocarbamate, applied at a depth of 1.5 inches in Tifton loamy sand were much more toxic to yellow nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus L.), sicklepod (Cassia tora L.), and Texas millet (Panicum texanum Buckl.) than when applied at 0.75 inches. The optimum depth of application may vary with different soils. Optimum subsurface placement was more effective than either soil incorporation or preemergence surface application.
10.2307/4041026|The most successful herbicides for control of downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.) in grassland were: 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole), 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine), 2-chloro-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (propazine), and 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine). More consistent downy brome control was obtained with atrazine than the other s-triazines. Amitrole improved postemergence control of the s-triazines in the tillering stage. Intermediate wheatgrass (Agropyron intermedium (Host.) Beauv.), crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum L. Gaertn.), western wheatgrass (Agropyron smithii Rydb.), blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis (H. B. K.) Lag.), and sedge (Carex spp.) appeared to be more sensitive to most s-triazines than needle-and-thread (Stipa comata Trin. & Rupr.) and sand dropseed (Sporobolus cryptandrus Torr.). Sand dropseed was extremely tolerant.
10.2307/4041025|In nutrient solution, 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA) was less toxic to oats than either 2-methoxy-3,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (dicamba) or 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (amiben). The latter two herbicides were similar in phytotoxicity. In soil, dicamba was the most phytotoxic in each of four soils used, while 2,3,6-TBA and amiben were similar in toxicity in all soils except the organic soil, in which amiben was less phytotoxic than 2,3,6-TBA. In the sandy soils the same amount of herbicide was required to reduce the growth of oats by 50% as was required in nutrient solution, but considerably higher amounts were required in the organic soil. This reduction in phytotoxicity was attributed to adsorption of the herbicides in an unavailable form by the organic matter of the soils, amiben being adsorbed to a greater extent than 2,3,6-TBA or dicamba. Practically no adsorption occurred on the clay colloids of the various soils. In persistence studies, amiben was more subject to apparent microbial decomposition than 2,3,6-TBA or dicamba. Decomposition was more rapid in the organic soil than in the clay or sandy soils. In leaching studies, the three herbicides were readily washed out of columns of the various soils. Differences in movement of herbicide in these soils could be related to the rate of water movement through the soil.
10.2307/4041045|The addition of 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) to nutrient solutions of corn (Zea mays L.) increased the percent of N and total mg of N in one test regardless of the N level in the solution. Under the low N level, the magnitude of this increase was 90 percent with 0.5 ppm simazine. However, in a second experiment, under environmental conditions more favorable for corn growth, the total mg of N was not increased, although the percent nitrogen in the shoots was increased at the lower nitrogen level. Corn plants treated with hydroxy simazine responded similarly to the controls.
10.2307/4041024|The photosynthetic capacities of three species of dodder, largeseed dodder (Cuscuta indecora, Choisy), field dodder (Cuscuta campestris, Yuncker), and small-seeded dodder (Cuscuta approximata, Bab.) were studied by radioactive carbon dioxide uptake in light and darkness, and by manometric methods. Both methods showed that all three species were able to carry on a small amount of photosynthesis. The photosynthetic capacity was highest in the seedling, and decreased as the dodder became parasitic.
10.2307/4041039|A Streptomyces, apparently S. viridochromogenes, was isolated from Louisiana crop areas where seven chlorinated herbicides had been used in weed control. It liberated no chloride when grown in a liquid medium containing 100 ppm of any of these seven herbicides. With a cucumber root bioassay, detoxification of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid (silvex), 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid (fenac), 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon) was observed, but little detoxification was shown with 2-chloro-N,N-diallylacetamide (CDAA), isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamate (CIPC), and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T). Manometric studies with 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, and silvex showed the streptomycete was capable of adapting to the compounds after a short period, but not to 2,4-dichlorophenol, a proposed intermediate of 2,4-D metabolism. The organism did not alter the ring structure of the aromatic herbicides, and 2,4-D and 2,4-dichlorophenol showed identical absorption curves with the spectrophotometer used.
10.2307/4041035| The herbicide 3,4-dichloropropionanilide (propanil) effectively controlled barnyardgrass [Echinochloa crusgalli (L.) Beauv.], brachiaria [Brachiaria platyphylla (Griseb.) Nash], crabgrass [Digitaria spp.], sesbania [Sesbania exaltata (Raf.) Cory], curly indigo [Aeschynomene virginica (L.) B.S.P.], spikerush [Eleocharis spp.], and umbrellasedge [Cyperus spp.] in the 1- to 4-leaf stages without significant injury to commercial varieties of rice in the 1- to 2-leaf stages. It was ineffective for control of ducksalad [Heteranthera spp.], redstem [Ammannia coccinea Rottb.], morningglory [Ipomoea spp.], sprangletop [Leptochloa panicoides (Presl.) Hitchc.], and red rice [Oryza sativa L.]. Mixtures of propanil and a blended surfactant, containing petroleum sulfonate, free and combined fatty acids, and petroleum oil, and mixtures of propanil and isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamate (CIPC) and methyl 2.4-dichlorocarbanilate (swep), controlled barnyardgrass better than propanil alone. Propanil sometimes injured the rice, but it recovered in 5 to 10 days after treatment and yield and quality were unaffected. 
10.2307/4040672|In agar cultures 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) reduced bud activity of quackgrass (Agropyron repens (L.) Beauv.) rhizomes, while indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) had little effect. Gibberellic acid (GA) acted antagonistically with NAA. Maleic hydrazide (MH) had less effect on bud activity than isopropyl N-phenylcarbamate (IPC), 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid (fenac), or phenoxy compounds at high rates. GA or its active metabolite was translocated throughout the plant. 2,3,5-Triiodobenzoic acid stimulated bud activity on intact rhizomes.
10.2307/4040687| The effect of mono-and dichlorophenyl analogs of N-phenyl-2-methylpentanamide (PMP) and N-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-alkylamides on the photolytic activity (Hill reaction) of chloroplasts isolated from turnip greens (Brassica spp.) was studied. Photochemical activity was measured potentiometrically with ferricyanide as the electron acceptor. PMP inhibited the Hill reaction by 50 percent (I) at 4.5  10 M. Monochlorination in the meta and para ring positions enhanced the inhibitory activity whereas chlorination in the ortho position negated inhibitory activity of the parent chemical (PMP). N-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-methylpentanamide (3,4-DCPMP) was the most inhibitory of the 6 dichlorinated isomers (I = 5.8  10 M). Replacement of the imino hydrogen of 3,4-DCPMP with a methyl group reduced inhibitory activity below that of the unsubstituted parent compound (PMP). Of the straight-chain N-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)alkylamides studied, the propanamide expressed maximum inhibition. 2-Methylalkylamides were more inhibitory than the corresponding straight-chain alkylamides. Maximum inhibition in the branched series was obtained with 3,4-DCPMP. Kinetic studies performed with 3,4-DCPMP at different light intensities indicated that both light and dark reactions were inhibited. However, the light reaction was more sensitive to the effects of the chemical. 
10.2307/4040684|Rough pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.) on the average emerged 2 days earlier than yellow foxtail (Setaria glauca (L.) Beauv.) The heading and maturity of both weeds seeded in corn was delayed for 3-4 days. The interval between emergence and maturity decreased progressively as seeding dates were delayed. The tallest plants and the highest yields were produced from the early spring seedings. Competition from corn depressed yields of both weeds more than their heights. Height and yield of foxtail seeded during July were most affected. In later seedings foxtail tolerated corn competition much better than pigweed.
10.2307/4040686|Herbicide experiments conducted on flowering size gladiolus corms over a four year period have shown that 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) at 1 lb/A preemergence and 1 lb/A at lay-by; ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (EPTC), 6 lb/A preemergence and 6 lb/A at lay-by; or 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron) either 1 lb/A preemergence and 1 lb/A at lay-by or 2 lb/A at lay-by appear to be safe and effective herbicides for weed control on varieties Spic & Span, Valeria, Hopman's Glory, Spotlight, Elizabeth the Queen, Friendship, and White Excelsior.
10.2307/4040680|Dalapon (2,2-dichloropropionic acid) was applied as basally directed sprays to field grown cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. var. Acala 4-42). Herbicidal rates of dalapon applied after heavy boll development (approximately 105 days after planting) were noninjurious; earlier applications appeared hazardous. Three or six pounds of dalapon per acre applied during early square or full flowering caused no noticeable injury symptoms but delayed maturity and reduced cotton yields in proportion to dosage. Analysis of eight seed and fiber properties showed no significant differences among treatments except for minor shifts attributable to dalapon-induced changes in maturity. Germination of seed from treated cotton was measurably retarded but final viability was not reduced. The retarding influence persisted for more than two years in storage. Accumulation of 8 to 21 ppm dalapon in the seeds was demonstrated by colorimetric and isotope dilution methods of analysis.
10.2307/4040683|Field studies at three locations across Nebraska showed that 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA) leached readily into the soil profile. The herbicide was lost from the surface soil much more readily in central and western Nebraska than in eastern Nebraska even though rainfall was about twice as much at the last location. Volatilization was suggested as a possible reason for this loss of 2,3,6-TBA. There was a definite, but not complete, loss of 2,3,6-TBA from the three soil profiles between May 1960 and September 1961. Soybeans proved to be an acceptable bioassay plant for this herbicide in soil at 2,3,6-TBA concentrations of 1/2 to 2 ppmw.
10.2307/4040682| Measurements of C-labeled 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid absorbed and translocated from treated leaves of blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica Muenchh.) showed that absorption and translocation were highest in early spring and decreased during May and June, so that there was a minimum at about the first of July. Absorption and translocation increased during July, August, and September. Measurements of soil moisture did not reveal a correlation of water stress and translocation rates. Extensive variations in the respiration rates of the leaf tissue occurred during the growing season. The trends in respiration rates generally paralled the trends in translocation rates. 
10.2307/4040678|Treatment of woollyleaf franseria, Franseria tomentosa Gray, with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) at three locations in Nebraska showed that June treatments were much more effective in reducing the stand than those made in July and August. The isopropyl ester and butoxyethanol ester of 2,4-D were somewhat more effective than the triethanolamine salt. Rates of 2 and 4 lb/A gave the most consistent results.
10.2307/4040690|Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamate (CIPC), 2-chloroallyl diethyldithiocarbamate (CDEC), ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (EPTC), sodium 2,4-dichlorophenoxyethyl sulfate (sesone), and N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) controlled Amaranthus palmeri S. Wats., (Palmer amaranth) Echinochloa colonum (L.) Link, (junglerice) and Sorghum vulgare Pers. var. sudanense Hitchc. (sudangrass) more efficiently when applications were followed by overhead irrigation, except in a few instances where weeds were controlled regardless of the irrigation method. More CIPC, sesone, CDEC, and EPTC penetrated below 1/4 inch into soils, and they penetrated deeper with overhead irrigation.
10.2307/4040688|Most of the elongation responsible for barnyardgrass seedling emergence occurred in the first internode. The developing foliar leaves within the coleoptile were the consistent site of EPTC injury. Injury symptoms were never observed in the roots. The first internodes of EPTC-injured seedlings seemed to function normally, although they were sometimes kinked into zig-zag patterns. This kinking was a secondary rather than a direct effect of EPTC injury. Seed germination was not affected by EPTC. Injury occurred after germination. Exposing the seed and primary root to EPTC did not lead to injury, whereas exposing the shoot or only the coleoptile did. It was concluded that leaf tissue is the main site of EPTC uptake in barnyardgrass as well as the prime site of injury.
10.2307/4040673|Polychlorobenzoic acids (PBA), 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA), and 2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid (fenac) sprays were applied safely for the eradication of perennial weeds at not over 20 pounds per square inch in winds less than 11 miles per hour in and near cotton. Use of these herbicides near soybeans was hazardous because very small quantities of them caused leaf deformities and some loss in seed yield.
10.2307/4040681|The interaction of soil applied phosphorus and soil applied herbicides was investigated in field, greenhouse and controlled environment chamber studies. A previously reported diuronphosphorus interaction could not be repeated under all conditions studied. Amitrole was consistently more toxic to plants grown under high phosphorus levels than under low phosphorus conditions. The phytotoxicity of ten other herbicides was not influenced by the phosphorus content of the soil.
10.2307/4040675|Smooth bromegrass, Bromus inermis, and red fescue, Festuca rubra, were sown in 1952 on a fertile soil severely infested with yellow toadflax, Linaria vulgaris Mill., in the Peace River section of Alberta. Annual applications of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) were made at late flower-bud stage at nil, 1, 2, 3, and 4 lb/A acid equiv. In 1958, the average per cent of toadflax in the brome was 1, 0.5, 0.5, 0, and 0, respectively. Red fescue had 6 to 0.1% of toadflax. All rates of 2,4-D prevented seed production. The sods were broken in 1959, and toadflax re-established strongly on all plots from dormant seed and residual plants. In 1961, the brome, rejuvenated by breaking, strongly suppressed toadflax, while fescue failed to compete with it.
10.2307/4040671| Optimum temperature for bud activity and shoot growth of quackgrass (Agropyron repens (L.) Beauv.) occurred between 20 and 27 C. CO and O gas concentrations normally occurring in soil air were not found to affect bud activity and shoot growth appreciably. 
10.2307/4040677| Techniques were developed for evaluating herbicides on submersed, floating, and emersed aquatic weeds. Among 75 herbicides evaluated on three species of submersed weeds only 1:1-ethylene-2:2-dipyridylium (diquat); 1:1-dimethyl-4:4-dipyridylium (paraquat); di-N,N-dimethylcocoamine salt of 3,6-endoxohexahydrophthalic acid (endothal); and acrylaldehyde (acrolein) gave 85 percent or better control at 1 ppmw in still-water tests. Only acrolein and the di-N,N-dimethylcocoamine salt of endothal were effective on submersed weeds at 1 ppmw in the limited-exposure test. The evaluation of 17 herbicides on three species of floating aquatic weeds indicated that diquat was effective when applied at rates of 1 or 2 lb/A. The tertiary fatty acid amines of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) were more effective on floating weeds than an ester of 2,4-D. Many of the 78 herbicides evaluated on alligatorweed (Alternanthera philoxeroides (Mart.) Griseb.) killed the tops, but only two retarded the sprouting of underwater nodes longer than 6 weeks. Applications of 20 lb/A of 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)-propionic acid (silvex) in two formulations retarded sprouting of underwater nodes for 8 weeks. 
10.2307/4040674|Herbicidal control of tall larkspur, Delphinium occidentale Wats. was investigated in the Sawtooth National Forest near Oakley, Idaho. When larkspur was in a prebud stage, 4 and 8 lb/A of the propylene glycol butyl ether esters of 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid (silvex) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) gave good control, with significant increases in yield of native grasses. At the bud and flower stages neither herbicide gave satisfactory control at 12 lb/A. Granular silvex at 400 lb/A total product (80 lb/A ae) killed all larkspur with only slight injury to rabbitbrush, sagebrush, and native grasses. A chlorate-borate (25%-75%) mixture gave a complete larkspur kill at 1740 lb/A.
10.2307/4040685|The toxicity to bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus, Rafinesque) of 3 to 21 commercial formulations of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T), 2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)propionic acid [2-(2,4-DP)], and 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid (silvex) was determined. The variations among formulations of the same herbicide were much greater than those among different herbicides. Variations in toxicity of a single formulation were also noted. Formulations of each herbicide were reported as either safe or unsafe for aquatic applications. Amine salts were generally less toxic to fish than esters. The formulation selected for use should be assayed prior to field application, using the receiving water.
10.2307/4040689|Foliar applications using volumes of 100 to 500 ml per acre were used to determine the effect of droplet size on herbicide toxicity to five plant species. Several types of plant response were used to indicate effectiveness. Herbicide toxicity increased as the particle diameter decreased from 0.3 mm to 0.1 mm.
10.2307/4040676|Twenty-nine s-triazines were evaluated as subsurface and surface preemergence sprays for the control of crabgrass in corn, grain sorghum, soybean, and cotton and as directed postemergence sprays in cotton. In preemergence experiments corn was tolerant to most chloro-alkylamino-s-triazines but was severely injured by most methoxy- and methylmercapto-alkylamino-s-triazines. 2-Chloro-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine [propazine], 2,4-bis(ethylamino)-6-trichloromethyl-s-triazine, and 2-chloro-4-isopropylamino-6-methylamino-s-triazine were about equally effective for selective preemeregence weed control in grain sorghum. 2,4-Bis(ethylamino)-6-trichloromethyl-s-triazine and perhaps 2-methoxy-4,6-bis [(3-methoxy)propylamino]-s-triazine were sufficiently active and selective to suggest additional evaluation as preemergence herbicides for soybeans. Cotton exhibited tolerance to certain methylmercapto derivatives; 2,4-bis(isopropylamino)-6-methylmercapto-s-triazine [prometryne] as a preemergence and as a directed postemergence spray appeared especially promising for control of weeds in cotton. Generally methoxy- and methyl-mercapto-alkylamino-s-triazines as preemergence and postemergence sprays were more effective for controlling crabgrass than corresponding chloro-alkylamino-s-triazines. The initial and residual toxicities of 14 of the more promising s-triazines were compared in four soils of the southern United States. Initial effective levels of the methoxy and methylmercapto derivatives varied more among soils than those of corresponding chloro derivatives. In most cases methoxy s-triazines were more toxic to the fifth oat crop than corresponding chloro s-triazines whereas chloro s-triazines exhibited the greatest initial toxicities. Certain methylmercapto derivatives appeared fairly persistent also.
10.2307/4040679|The toxic effects of 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) to barley were avoided by feeding plants treated with 1.5 lb/A of simazine, sucrose, glucose, aspartate, and maltose. Shoots from plants fed glucose and maltose contained more soluble carbohydrate than the check. Plants fed glutamine and asparagine were higher in total nitrogen content than the check. Plants fed sucrose and maltose increased their nitrogen content over the check, but plants fed glucose did not. The harmful effects of simazine occurred primarily in barley shoots exposed to light. Plants grown in the dark showed a very small decrease in weight of shoots and soluble carbohydrate content as the level of simazine increased, while the weight of the shoots and soluble carbohydrate content of treated plants grown in the light decreased sharply. Simazine had little effect on root growth of plants grown in the light or dark. The data on root respiration showed that barley roots metabolized the added substances differently and that simazine differentially influenced their metabolism by the roots.
10.2307/4040521|The temperature at which seeds of witchweed (Striga asiatica (L.) Kuntze), an obligate parasite, were stored markedly influenced the length of time that the seeds remained dormant. Dormancy was broken completely by storing seeds collected in August, 1960, at 88 F for 6 weeks, at 75 for 24 weeks, at 40 for 32 weeks and at 0 F for 40 weeks. Seed viability was lost rapidly when the storage of seeds was continued at 88 or 100 F plus 100% relative humidity after seed dormancy had been broken. All of the seeds stored under those conditions were non-viable within 20 weeks after storage began. The viability of seeds stored at 75, 40 or 0 F had not decreased after 26 months for 1960 seeds. Seeds collected in 1961 and stored at those three temperatures or at 88 F plus 20% relative humidity for 14 months did not decrease in per cent viability. A hypothesis on the physiology of the dormancy, viability, and germination of witchweed seeds is presented.
10.2307/4040541|Amine salts of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxypropionic acid (silvex) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) were applied to tall larkspur, Delphinium barbeyi Huth, at 2, 4, and 8 lb/A on three dates. Leaf and stem samples collected 1, 2, and 3 weeks after treatment yielded significantly higher concentrations of alkaloids than did controls. Leaves and stems from plants treated with silvex contained more alkaloids than did those treated with 2,4,5-T. Alkaloid concentration in the leaves varied directly with the rate of herbicide following the first treatment in mid-July, but this relation was not apparent in samples obtained from the third treatment in August.
10.2307/4040544|Weeds in row crops of the Lower Coastal Plain in Alabama were sampled by line transects in both April and August. More than 100,000 feet of transects were assayed, with detailed questioning of producers in the area. The most important weeds of summer and fall and of winter and spring are listed, with per cent coverage and per cent frequency for weeds of row crops.
10.2307/4040524|Disodium endothal (3,6 endoxohexahydrophthalic acid) was applied to a number of emergent and submerged aquatic species and was found to be particularly effective in controlling pondweeds, Potamogeton spp. On P. foliosus, P. crispus, and P. pectinatus, liquid and granular preparations appeared to be equally effective. Endothal was not very effective on some species, such as waterwillow, Justicia americana, and creeping waterprimrose, Jussiaea repens L. var. glabrescens, although defoliation did occur.
10.2307/4040536| The effect of ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (EPTC) on photosynthesis was determined by CO fixation by red kidney bean, Phaseolus vulgaris L., leaves following root application of this herbicide in a time-course study at various concentrations of the herbicide. EPTC inhibited CO fixation at relatively high concentrations and long exposures of the herbicide, but did not alter the relative distribution of C in the various labeled compounds. The effect of EPTC on the respiration of excised embryos of corn and mung bean (Phaseolus aureus Roxb.) following 24 or 48 hr exposures to the herbicide. When the data were expressed on a fresh-weight basis, it indicated that EPTC stimulated respiration, but the same data expressed on an embryo basis did not show this stimulation. EPTC inhibited the growth and the concurrent increase in fresh weight of these embryos. The effect of EPTC on oxidative phosphorylation was determined with cucumber mitochondria. EPTC markedly inhibited both phosphorus uptake and oxygen consumption. Phosphorus esterification was more sentitive than oxygen utilization: this gave a reduced P/O ratio or an uncoupling effect. However, since the concentration of EPTC required to produce these effects was quite high, the physiological significance of the results is questionable. 
10.2307/4040535|The butoxyethanol and propylene glycol butyl esters of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) were applied to and recovered from the leaf surfaces of garden bean and corn plants. Both the acid and the ester of 2,4-D were recovered, indicating that hydrolysis of the esters had occurred. The acid and esters of 2,4-D were also found in both leaves and stems of the bean plants, indicating that further hydrolysis had occurred within the plants. Bean plant homogenates incubated with 2,4-D esters yielded 2,4-D acid. The root exudate from corn plants treated with 2,4-D butoxyethanol ester showed the presence of both acid and ester.
10.2307/4040525|The herbicides n-propyl ethyl-n-butylthiolcarbamate (PEBC), PEBC + 2,3-dichloroallyl diisopropylthiolcarbamate (DATC), PEBC + ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (EPTC), and PEBC + 2,3,3-trichloroallyl diisopropyldithiolcarbamate (CP-22819) among others produced effective control of lambsquarters (Chenopodium album), pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), Setaria spp. and other weed species without undue injury to sugar beet seedlings. PEBC + DATC also gave control of wild oat (Avena fatua), and increased the control of lambsquarters; however, this latter effect was inversely related to the control of other broad-leaved weeds. Control equal to PEBC was produced by PEBC + EPTC with 2.5 lb. less total active ingredient per acre. The herbicide 3,6-endoxohexahydrophthalic acid (endothal) gave inferior control of weeds. None of the herbicides tested effectively controlled kochia (Kochia scoparia).
10.2307/4040531|Greenhouse evaluation of 30 s-triazine compounds indicated that several of them were suitable for preemergence weed control in Lee soybeans. The s-triazines least toxic to soybeans generally contained either methoxy or methylmercapto substituents but most of these were highly toxic to crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop.). Soybeans were more tolerant to ethylamino substituted s-triazines than to isopropylamino derivatives. Chloro derivatives were generally toxic to soybeans. Proplyamino, allylamino, methoxypropylamino, ethoxy, trichloromethyl, and amido substitutions had much less effect on soybean selectivity than those previously mentioned. Field evaluation of several s-triazines, preemergence, confirmed the tolerance of soybeans to 2,4-bis(isopropylamino)-6-methylmercapto-s-triazine (prometryne), 2-ethylamino-4-isopropylamino-6-methylmercapto-s-triazine (ametryne), and 2-isopropylamino-4-methylamino-6-methylmercapto-s-triazine (norametryne) at rates that provided adequate weed control.
10.2307/4040527|Inclusion of any one of several ethoxylated nonionic surfactants in aqueous spray mixtures of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron) greatly increased its toxicity to crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop.). Phytotoxicity of sprays made up from commercially formulated diuron was greater than when technical diuron was used. The toxicity of diuron was also increased by the addition of any of several low-molecular-weight alcohols to the spray mixture. The turbidity of diuron suspensions was greatly decreased by addition of any of several nonionic, anionic, or cationic surfactants which contained a fatty acid or fatty acid derivative as the hydrophobic portion of the molecule. Phytotoxicity of diuron applied with ethoxylated nonylphenol surfactants was associated with ethylene oxide (hydrophil) content. Surfactants containing nonylphenol, alkylthiol, or tridecylphenol as hydrophobes appeared essentially equal in their abilities to increase diuron toxicity, but dodecylphenol surfactants were slightly less effective.
10.2307/4040538|Herbicide performance was markedly altered by soil incorporation, depth of incorporation, crop seed placement, soil type, and rainfall. Of the 25 herbicides studied, 2-chloro-N,N-diallylacetamide (CDAA) and isopropyl-N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamate (CIPC) and mixtures of them showed most promise. Herbicide-placement studies showed that the selectivity of these herbicides in cotton largely depends on herbicide placement in relation to the crop seed and on rainfall. Without rainfall, CDAA incorporated in moist soil above the cotton seed provided excellent weed control with minimal injury to cotton. CDAA was readily leached from the zone of germinating weed seed by rain or irrigation on coarse-textured soils. Without rainfall, CIPC was slightly inferior to CDAA in weed control but more stable in performance over a wider range of environmental conditions. Mixtures of CDAA and CIPC were somewhat superior to either alone. Commercial usage of these herbicides in moist soil depends on the development of suitable equipment for application.
10.2307/4040529|3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole) sprayed on annual grassland infested with medusahead (Elymus caput-medusae L.) at 1/2 to 4 lb/A when medusahead was in the boot or soft dough stage reduced viable caryopses from 60 to 100 percent, and seed production the following year from 75 to almost 100 percent. 1,2-Dihydropyridazine-3-6-dione (maleic hydrazide) and 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon) reduced viability of medusahead seeds, but were less effective than amitrole. Viable caryopses of soft chess (Bromus mollis L.) were reduced and the year following treatment soft chess was decreased in the stands by early application (boot stage of medusahead) but not by late application of herbicides, when the soft chess heads were dry.
10.2307/4040526|2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine), ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (EPTC), and 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) were shown to aid in the establishment of rose clover (Trifolium hirtum All.) and hardinggrass (Phalaris tuberosa L. var. stenoptera (Hack.) Hitch.) by reducing competition from resident annual plants, primarily medusahead (Elymus caput-medusae L.). The success of preemergence herbicides was shown to depend on fall precipitation in amounts great enough to permit seed germination and plant growth before winter temperatures become limiting. The degree of weed control necessary to aid in seedling establishment was low, sometimes lower than could be measured by estimates of ground cover.
10.2307/4040543|During 1962, barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crusgalli (L.) Beauv.) seedlings were infested by the larvae of Hyperodes humilis Gyll. The larvae attacked the growing points and the youngest tissues in the crown as well as meristematic tissues of intercalary growth. These infestations produced considerable decreases of barnyardgrass growth and yields, suggesting the possibility of effective biological control of barnyardgrass.
10.2307/4040537|The apparent solubility in water of 2-ethylamino-4-isopropylamino-6-methylmercapto-s-triazine [ametryne], 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl urea [diuron], and 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine [atrazine] was increased when a surfactant was added to the water. At 0.5% surfactant concentrations, considerable variation in solubility was found, both as regards the herbicide and surfactant used, as measured by ultraviolet absorption spectrophotometry. The two triazines were more soluble in cationic surfactants, followed by anionic and nonionic; diuron was more soluble in cationic followed by nonionic and anionic types. Minimum lethal levels of surfactant in water for 2 week old cucumber plants varied from about 0.1% for the cationic to 0.2% for most nonionic and 1.0% or more for anionics of the alkyl aryl sulfonate type.
10.2307/4040530|Preplanting, soil-incorporated treatments of fenac (2,3,6-trichlorophenylacetic acid sodium salt) at 1, 2, 4, and 8 lb/A, 2,3,6-TBA (2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid dimethylamine salt) at 8. 12, and 16 lb/A, and 2,4-D 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid amine salt) at 12 lb/A applied in 1960 to six soil types infested with witchweed (Striga asiatica (L.) Kuntze) resulted in some control of witchweed as measured by visual observations and corn yield. Two or three additional postemergence applications of 2,4-D at 1 lb/A were required to prevent witchweed seed production for the growing season. Witchweed parasitism on corn was greatly reduced by a preplanting treatment of fenac at 2 lb/A plus 2,4-D as a postemergence treatment. All rates of 2,3,6-TBA and fenac at 8 lb/A caused moderate to severe corn injury with the most severe injury occurring on soils with relatively high clay content in the subsoil. Soil residual studies and field observations indicated fenac and 2,3,6-TBA may be present in Coastal Plain soils for more than 18 months.
10.2307/4040539|In tests conducted from 1951 to 1961 in the Peace River section of Alberta, 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron) was applied to vigorous quackgrass (Agropyron repens (L.) Beauv.) sods on different soils. These tests showed: 1) tillage either before or after application of monuron strongly reduced its effect; 2) when used without tillage it did not matter whether monuron was applied in the early summer or early autumn, but when used with tillage it was best applied in the early summer; 3) 40 lb/A applied without tillage eradicated quackgrass under all conditions except when it was established in an unusually deep and loamy soil; 4) killing quackgrass by monuron usually took 2 years; and 5) lethal rates of monuron prevented quackgrass re-establishment for from 1 to 7 years and satisfactory growth of cereal crops for 10 years or more.
10.2307/4040532| The effect of fully-saturated bicyclic and partially-saturated tricyclic dimethylureas and dimethylthioureas on the photolytic activity (Hill reaction) of chloroplasts isolated from turnip greens (Brassica spp.) was studied. Photochemical activity was measured potentiometrically with ferricyanide as the electron acceptor. Chemicals tested were 3-[5-(3a,4,5,6,7a-hexahydro-4,7-methanoindenyl)]1,1-dimethylurea; 3-(chloro-2-norbornyl)-1,1-dimethylurea; 1,1-dimethyl-3-(2-norbornyl)urea; and the 3 corresponding thioureas. Concentrations of the 3 polycyclic ureas required to inhibit the Hill reaction by 50 percent (I) were respectively 4.0  10 M, 1.2  10 M, and 6.6  10 M. The thioureas were not very inhibitory to the Hill reaction; consequently, their I values were not determined. The fully or partially-saturated polycyclic dimethylureas were weaker inhibitors of the Hill reaction than the phenyldimethylureas. The decreased inhibitory activity of the polycyclic ureas was attributed to increased lipophilic properties, unfavorable spatial configurations, and lack of resonance interaction between the ring system and the imino nitrogen. 
10.2307/4040523|Atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine) applied in nutrient solution to corn, cotton, and soybeans reduced transpiration both in intact plants and excised shoots. This effect occurred only in the light. Microscopic examination revealed that atrazine caused closure of the stomates. Atrazine treated plants had higher moisture levels than the checks 12-24 hours after treatment, but later percentages were lower than the checks.
10.2307/4040533|Long-term compensation points in waterstargrass (Heteranthera dubia (Jacq.) Mac M), coontail (Ceratophyllum demersum L.), and duckweed (Lemna minor L.) were near 2-3% full sunlight during a 28-day period. Fresh weight of H. dubia increased as temperature increased from 15 to 30 C and as light intensity increased from 110 to 1000 foot-candles. Fresh weight of C. demersum increased as temperature increased above 20 C and as light intensity increased from 120 to 550 foot-candles. The L. minor strain used in this experiment was not temperature-dependent and increased in fresh weight and frond number at 25 and 30 C as light intensity increased from 77 to 550 foot-candles.
10.2307/4040534| Orchardgrass (Dactylic glomerata L.) and Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) were used as test species to study the phytotoxicity of mixtures of 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon) and dimethylarsinic acid (cacodylic acid). A technique involving ED values, a shortened graphic procedure, and probit transformations was developed. Mixtures in which cacodylic acid was in excess indicated synergistic effects on bluegrass and additive effects on orchardgrass. Dalapon in excess in the mixtures appeared to have had an antagonistic effect on cacodylic acid. Orchardgrass was more tolerant to cacodylic acid than bluegrass. 
10.2307/4040528|Peach trees treated with the herbicide mixture of 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole plus ammonium thiocyanate (amitrole-T) had higher leaf nitrogen and more growth than trees where the weeds were controlled by hand hoeing or a black plastic mulch. Apple trees had higher leaf nitrogen and more growth when treated with simazine and amitrole-T than with no weed control. In both peaches and apples more growth and higher leaf nitrogen resulted from the herbicide treatments than from supplemental nitrogen treatments, indicating that the herbicide influenced the nitrogen metabolism of these trees.
10.2307/4040540|During the vegetative phase of barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crusgalli (L.) Beauv.) development, the leaves, axillary buds (tillers) and permanent root system were initiated and developed. First adventitious roots appeared on the 6th day after germination. Internode elongation, which was coincident with a change from a vegetative phase to a reproductive phase of the plant, was observed in the field about 30 days after germination. At this time the main stem had 4-5 maturing leaves. Typically, barnyardgrass formed 8 leaves on the main axis from primordia which were initiated during the first two weeks after germination. The first tiller primordium appeared in the axil of either the 1st or 2nd leaf on the day of emergence from the soil. In the field, tillering was observed from the twelfth day. Heading began on the 40th day and the first mature seeds were formed about 64 days after germination.
10.2307/4040522|The response of purple nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus L.) clones grown from single tubers to 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole), butoxyethanol ester of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (EPTC), and the response of established nutsedge to amitrole were studied under field conditions of the Georgia Piedmont Plateau. Clones were essentially eradicated by two applications of amitrole initiated up to 4 weeks after shoot emergence and by EPTC incorporated at 1 or 2 weeks after emergence. Excellent control resulted from 9 applications of 2,4-D initiated 1 or 2 weeks after shoot emergence. Timely applications of amitrole to an established stand controlled but did not eradicate nutsedege. This decreased response in an established stand seemed due, in part, to irregular emergence of plants in the established stand.
10.2307/4040702|The observation that riboflavin overcomes the chlorosis response of higher plants to amitrole was confirmed. Amitrole was shown to be decomposed in the presence of riboflavin and light. It is suggested that this decomposition proceeds by a free radical mechanism, either in the culture medium or in the plant.
10.2307/4040700| Chain- and ring-labeled 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) were supplied to corn by way of the nutrient solution. Autoradiographs of the paper chromatograms revealed that two identical C-labeled metabolites were present in the extracts whether the plants were supplied with ring- or chain-labeled simazine. Corn, cotton, and soybeans all yielded appreciable amounts of CO when grown in solutions containing chain-labeled simazine. One lb/A 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) (preemergence) caused a reduction in respiration as well as the activity of catalase, peroxidase, phenol oxidase, ascorbic acid oxidase, and glycolic acid oxidase in oats, soybeans, beans, cotton, peanuts, Johnsongrass, and corn, 7 and 11 days after treatment. Attempts to correlate enzyme activity with sensitivity to atrazine were unsuccessful, except that increasing phenol oxidase activity appeared to be roughly correlated with increasing resistance. 
10.2307/4040697|An accurate method of determining loss of 2-chloro-N, N-diallylacetamide (CDAA) from soil surfaces was developed. It was found that under some circumstances the volatility response to temperature was reversed to give a decreasing loss with increasing temperature. The volatility-temperature relationship was found to be strongly influenced by the amount of water present on the soil colloid, with increasing amounts of water accelerating CDAA volatility loss. The mechanism for this reaction appears to involve competition between water and CDAA for adsorption sites; however, this factor cannot be differentiated from removal of CDAA from the soil by simple solubilization in water with subsequent steam distillation. A direct correlation between organic matter content of the soil and resistance of CDAA to evaporation from that soil was shown.
10.2307/4040708|Development was followed in Connecticut and Maryland. Germination of yellow foxtail (Setaria lutescens (Weigel) F. T. Hubb. occurred over a long time period. Tillering of the developing plants was affected by spacing between plants and location. The average number of tillers in Maryland was 75 for plants spaced 12 in. apart and 26 for plants spaced 2 in. apart. In the greenhouse under short day conditions seed heads were readily produced. Under continuous light no seed heads formed. Giant foxtail (S. Faberii Herrm.) followed a similar growth pattern but the plants were larger and formed fewer tillers. Growth of both species was severely affected by shading. Both species rooted from cuttings.
10.2307/4040711|Ten herbicides were applied preemergence to proso millet (Panicum miliaceum), three Amaranthus species, and Chenopodium album L. The herbicides were either incorporated or left on the soil surface and plots were either sprinkler or furrow irrigated. The phytotoxicity of some herbicides was increased by soil incorporation and/or sprinkler irrigation. Some were unaffected by method of irrigation, and others were not affected by incorporation. Grass and broadleaf weed control were affected differently by incorporation and irrigation. When incorporated with furrow irrigation, five herbicides developed weed control patterns indicating a movement similar to salt movement. A more complex pattern occurred with non-incorporated herbicides.
10.2307/4040699|Early-spring, broadcast, disked-in applications of nitrogen fertilizers caused an increased germination of wild oat (Avena fatua L.) seed present in the soil. With adequate moisture, there was increased wild oat infestation in the seeded crop from early-spring application, whereas with dry weather the effects did not carry over into the crop period. The apparent breaking of seed dormancy by nitrates from fertilizer applications may offer another method for combating wild oats other than by herbicides. Fertilizer treatment might be used to deplete seed reserves in the fallow years and to reduce the amount of seed returned to the soil in the crop years by combining a fertilizer treatment with delayed crop seeding.
10.2307/4040710|The injurious effects of different rates of fenuron (3-peynyl-1,1-dimethylurea) on four species of brush were recorded for two years in two different types of southwestern brushlands, the Oak-chaparral and the Chihuahuan Desert Shrub. Fenuron was more injurious to fire sprouts than to mature plants of turbinella oak (Quercus turbinella Greene) in the Oak- chaparral type especially at 2 to 8 lb/A ai. The effects of fenuron on mature plants were reduced by burning, suggesting that much of the fenuron absorbed was residual in the stems, twigs, and leaves where it was destroyed by the fire. The effect of fenuron on the fire sprouts changed only slightly between six months and two years. Gibberellic acid was applied to sprouts and mature oak plants appeared to slightly reduce the injurious effects of some rates of fenuron during the first six months but no gibberellin induced differences were observed after two years. In the Chihuahuan Desert shrub type, tarbush (Flourencia cernua DC.) and whitethorn (Acacia constricta Benth.) were about equally susceptible to injury by fenuron with creosotebush (Larrea tridentata (DC.) Cov.) slightly more resistant. Summer applications just before the rainy season were most effective and 4 lb/A combined high shrub kill with greatest grass growth. Although 8 and 16 lb/A ai killed and injured both grasses and shrubs on the oak plots, grass naturally reseeded into these plots within six months after treatment, but on the Chihuahuan Desert area grass had not recovered on the plots treated at 8 lb/A after two years. This difference in grass re-establishment was probably due to rainfall differences which would give differences in leaching of fenuron. Palatability of the grasses in the oak plots increased due to fenuron treatments, particularly on the heavily treated plots. These studies indicate that moderate rates of fenuron, applied just prior to favorable seasonal rains and repeated at several-year intervals, may be used to control turbinella oak sprouts and mature Chihuahuan Desert shrubs. However, treatments would only be economical where high forage and watershed values would result.
10.2307/4040703|This paper extends previous observations on the interaction of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole) and riboflavin leading to the decomposition of amitrole to include the protective effect of amitrole on the photodestruction of flavins and flavoproteins. Photoactivation of radioactive amitrole in the presence of riboflavin causes the labeling of inert protein. Cupric ion, ascorbic acid, and oxygen can replace riboflavin and light in the destruction of amitrole and in the labeling of inert protein. The inhibition of fatty acid peroxidase previously reported by Castelfranco has been shown to be irreversible and to require the presence of a hydrogen peroxide generating system. The authors suggest a hypothesis for the mode of action of amitrole which depends upon the ability of this compound to interact with free radical generating systems, presumably by undergoing a one-electron oxidation.
10.2307/4040695|Addition of surfactant (a polyoxyethylene thioether) to solutions of sodium 2,2-dichloropropionate (dalapon) increased the activity of both technical and formulated grades of dalapon on Johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers.). The increase in activity was influenced by the rate and formulation of herbicide and in some instances by the volume of water in which treatments were applied. Varying the volume of diluent affected control with technical dalapon to a greater extent than that with formulated dalapon probably because of differences in surfactant concentrations. Plants arising from short rhizomes were more readily controlled by dalapon than those from longer rhizomes.
10.2307/4040694|Four forage grasses and five forage legumes were grown in greenhouse cultures containing 0.12, 0.25, 0.50, and 1.0 ppm of atrazine and of simazine in the soil. They were also planted April 2 and 9 in field plots which had been treated the previous spring with 0, 1, 2, and 4 lb/A of the same herbicides. In the greenhouse, atrazine produced more injury to the plants than simazine. In the field, residual simazine produced more marked injury. Tall fescue and alfalfa were the most tolerant crops. Timothy was the most susceptible. Red clover, Korean lespedeza, ladino clover, sweet-clover, orchardgrass, and bromegrass were intermediate.
10.2307/4040707|Of the grasses studied over a 3-year period, Alta tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) was most competitive and Troy bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) least competitive with Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense). Ladino white clover was more competitive than birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus) when present in full stands. Winter-killing of Ladino clover (Trifolium repens L.) resulted in an increase in Canada thistle, particularly at low irrigation levels. Irrigation favored an increase in Canada thistle numbers in the year the grass stands were established. In the next two years thistle numbers declined more rapidly on irrigated than on non-irrigated plots. High rates of nitrogen increased the competitive ability of the grasses.
10.2307/4040704|Ninety-one herbicides and experimental compounds were evaluated for herbicidal activity on submersed aquatic weeds, Potamogeton pectinatus L. and P. nodosus Poir. Twenty-one of the compounds tested showed some phytotoxicity at 20 lb/A. The other compounds were completely inactive. 2,3,6-Trichlorophenylacetic acid (fenac) and 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile (dichlobenil), showed outstanding activity with good persistence in water-saturated soil. Fenac and 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)propionic acid (silvex), were tested in field trials in an irrigation canal in eastern Wyoming. The sodium salt and amide of fenac did not give adequate weed control at 5 lb/A. Spring applications of herbicides did not perform as well as fall ones. Mechanical incorporation of herbicides improved some results, but was of doubtful value.
10.2307/4040698|Band applications of the best residual preemergence herbicides were equal to timely shallow cultivations for weed control in soybeans, and were superior when wet weather delayed the early shallow cultivations. The ten-year average soybean yield reduction of 3.8 bushels per acre from weed competition despite normal control methods suggests that, under normal conditions, the net cost of herbicide treatment would not exceed the value of the soybeans lost through failure to control weeds. Coarse broad-leaved annuals were a minor part of the weed populations and there was no giant foxtail, so the benefits of herbicides would probably be greater with these weeds present.
10.2307/4040701|Stands of leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.) were reduced over 90 per cent by 20 combinations of crops, cultivation, and herbicides. Three of the best crop rotations in two 4-year trials were: (1) a short season of intensive cultivation, a mid-August seeding of alfalfa, a crop of alfalfa, spring wheat sprayed with 1/2 lb/A of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) (an ester formulation was always used) three postharvest cultivations, corn sprayed with 1/3 lb/A 2,4-D; (2) a short season of intensive cultivation, a mid-August seeding of bromegrass sprayed with 1 lb/A 2,4-D in early June and mid-August during the second and third years, and a crop of corn the fourth year; (3) spring oats sprayed with 1/3 lb of 2,4-D ester and three postharvest cultivations, three spring cultivations a close-drilled crop of sudangrass and fall cultivation, spring wheat sprayed with 1/2 lb/A of 2,4-D ester and three fall cultivations, a crop of corn sprayed. The best use of non-selective herbicides in four 2-year trials was spring application of 4 to 6 lb/A of 2,3,6-(trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA), plow 10 days later, followed by a corn crop and a spring oats crop, both treated with 2,4-D and 4 to 6 lb/A of 2,3,6-TBA applied after oats harvest, and the field plowed 10 days later. Reinfestation by seedlings was prevented by an annual spring application of 1/3 to 1/2 lb/A of 2,4-D per acre.
10.2307/4040696|Triazines were applied to 1-0 stock (1-year-old, not transplanted) on sandy soils at 1/2, 1, and 2 lb/A and to 2-0 stock at 1, 2, and 4 lb/A. Simetone (2-methoxy-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine) had no apparent effects on weeds or seedlings. All rates of 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) and the higher rates of 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) and 2-chloro-4-isopropylamino-6-methylamino-s-triazine (G-30026) controlled weeds but seriously injured 1-0 stock. All rates of 2-chloro-4,6-bis(isopropylamino)-s-triazine (propazine) controlled weeds without injuring seedlings. Atrazine and G-30026 at 4 lb/A injured 2-0 stock. Simazine at 2 and 4 lb/A and atrazine at 1 and 2 lb/A did not affect 2-1 transplants. CDAA (2-chloro-N,N-diallylacetamide) and CDEC (2-chloroallyl diethyldithiocarbamate) at 4 and 8 lb/A did not affect weeds or 1-0 and 2-0 stock. At 16 and 32 lb/A, CDAA was highly toxic to weeds and stock, while CDEC controlled weeds with only a temporary effect on seedlings at 32 lb/A. CDAA and CDEC at 4 and 8 lb/A did not affect weeds or 2-1 transplants. N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) and sodium 2,4-dichlorophenoxyethyl sulfate (sesone) at 1.8 and 3.6 lb/A did not control weeds. Sesone injured 1-0 and 2-0, but not 2-1 red pine. Ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (EPTC) at 3 and 6 lb/A controlled weeds without injuring 1-0, 2-0, or 2-1 red pine. These experiments emphasized that many herbicides too toxic for nursery use may be useful in site preparation for planting or in plantation release.
10.2307/4040709|2-Methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) is widely used to control broad-leaved weeds in pea fields. Occasionally, peas are severely injured by MCPA. This study was conducted in 1959 and 1960 to determine the relationships, if any, of environmental factors and of chemical constituents of plants at the time of spraying to the tolerance of peas to MCPA. Plants were equally susceptible to MCPA at either the 5- or 10-node stages. The time of day at which plants were sprayed appeared to be the most important factor associated with the tolerance of pea to MCPA. Fresh weights of vines and yields of shelled peas from plants sprayed at noon and 4:00 pm were significantly lower than those from unsprayed plants or plants sprayed at other times of the day. The carbohydrate content of pea plants varied with the time of day (exposure to light). The carbohydrate content was associated with susceptibility to injury by MCPA. A high carbohydrate content at the time of spraying was associated with a high degree of susceptibility to MCPA. High temperature at the time of spraying tended to increase the rate of translocation of MCPA. However, in the absence of prolonged exposure to light prior to treatment, high temperature alone did not predispose peas to injury by MCPA.
10.2307/4040712|Three-quarter inch seedlings of northern nutsedge (Cyperus esculentus L.) were transplanted into the field where numbers of plants, inflorescences and the rate of spread were recorded. Seed was collected from each plot and germination tests conducted. During one growing season, a single seedling developed into a stand of plants that produced a yield of 90,000 seeds with a germination of 51%.
10.2307/4040705|Rates of evaporation of dalapon acid and four low-volatile esters of dalapon from open dishes at 38C. in pounds per acre per hour, determined gravimetrically, were dalapon acid, 180; propyleneglycol bis ester, 27; diethyleneglycol bis ester, 1.6; dipropyleneglycol bis ester, 0.83; and triethyleneglycol bis ester, 0.61. Foliar applications on an acid equivalent basis were phytotoxic to seedling oats in the increasing order of propyleneglycol bis ester, acid, dipropyleneglycol bis ester, diethyleneglycol bis ester, sodium salt, and tripropyleneglycol bis ester. Relative phytotoxicities were not altered by subjecting plants to rapid drying after spraying. These compounds did not differ significantly in phytotoxicity when added to the rooting medium of germinating oat plants. The triethyleneglycol bis ester, and possibly other esters of dalapon, may offer practical advantages as herbicides other than those related to volatility.
10.2307/4040706| Foliar absorption of 2,4-D-C was rapid in both species. Cotton decarboxylated the side chain of 2,4-D several times faster than sorghum. Both species released CO faster from the carboxyl than from the methylene position. Cotton slowly converted 2,4-D to a chromatographically different material in young leaves and bolls. Sorghum rapidly converted 2,4-D to a product different from 2,4-D and the 2,4-D-complex in cotton. After cotton recovered from 2,4-D-treatment, the regulator could not be detected in subsequent vegetative or reproductive growth. 
10.2307/4040573|In a "closed system" nutrient solution experiment, shoot growth of downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.) was: (1) more rapid during early growth, (2) accelerated earlier by nitrogen, and (3) increased more by low to intermediate levels of nitrogen than that of crested wheatgrass (Agropyron desertorum Fisch. ex Link). Shoot growth of crested wheatgrass was increased more by high levels of nitrogen and at a more mature stage of growth than that of downy brome. Root growth of crested wheatgrass was greater at all nitrogen levels than that of downy brome and was increased by the high nitrogen levels. Downy brome removed more nitrogen from solution at the intermediate nitrogen level than did crested wheatgrass and more phosphorus at both the low and intermediate nitrogen levels. At the highest nitrogen level, crested wheatgrass removed more nitrogen from solution than did downy brome.
10.2307/4040589|Rhizome sections of ironweed from which the fleshy roots had been pruned made less than half as much growth in the greenhouse as sections which had three inches of fleshy roots attached. Rhizome sections at least two inches long with portions of the fleshy roots intact should be used for asexual reproduction of ironweed. Ironweed plants in the field after 8 and 9 years of mowing treatments at 2 dates were approximately 2/3 as tall as untreated plants. No significant reduction in stand was obtained by 9 successive years of mowing.
10.2307/4040580|Rose clover (Trifolium hirtum All.), subterranean clover (T. subterraneum L.), and crimson clover (T. incarnatum L.), were sprayed at different growth stages with 2,2-dichloropropionic acid dalapon), and two formulations of 4-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-butyric acid [4-(2,4-DB)], in two growing seasons. Herbage yields, seed yields, and seed quality were for the most part unaffected by either formulation of 4-(2,4-DB) at the dates required for weed control. Only subterranean clover was tolerant of dalapon and then only at very low rates.
10.2307/4040593|A quick-coupling sprayer tank, a pressure introduction and release valve, and a device for measuring the time elapsed during a spraying run are described.
10.2307/4040588|Application of 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) generally reduced dry weight of tops and roots of corn and Pinus radiata seedlings. Simazine always increased top-root ratios of corn but generally decreased those of pine seedlings. Simazine increased significantly the uptake of N by corn in all soils; of Mg and P in limed, and of K in acidified soils. Aluminum sulfate decreased injury from simazine. Lime at 3 tons per acre mixed into the soil exerted a synergistic effect on the activity of 12 pounds per acre of simazine and killed all pine seedlings in the 7th or 8th week after sowing. The death of the seedlings was caused by excess calcium ions and not by pH.
10.2307/4040572| Amitrole-5-C was rapidly degraded in unsterile soil but underwent only minor modification in sterile soil. An unidentified chemical product of amitrole was formed in both sterile and unsterile soil. The principle metabolic product of amitrole was carbon dioxide; however, at least 13 additional compounds were formed. One or more metabolic compounds formed from amitrole are tenaciously bound to the soil and appear to be resistant to degradation. 
10.2307/4040586| C-ring-labeled 2-chloro-4-diethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (ipazine) was soil-applied to young cotton plants or placed in solution cultures. C-labeled constituents accumulated in the lysigenous glands of roots, stems, and leaves. Retranslocation of C-labeled components into new growth after removal of C-ipazine from solution cultures did not occur. No evolution of of CO by C-ipazine-treated plants was detected, but evolution of CO occurred from C-ipazine-treated soil. Some unaltered C-ipazine was present in leaves and stems sampled 3 months after treatment. No C-ipazine could be detected in seed formed on treated plants. Free hydroxyipazine did not constitute a major degradation product. However, hydroxyipazine and other basic substances appeared to be released upon hydrolysis of a chloroform-soluble, non-distillable component that accumulated in roots and leaves. An ethanol-insoluble, non-dialyzable component also accumulated in leaves and roots. 
10.2307/4040579|Unshielded cultivation (during which soil is purposely moved into the drill row) and shielded cultivation (soil movement into drill row minimized) were compared in field plots of cotton [Gossypium hirsutum L. (var. DBES 8274)] which received no herbicide, a banded preemergence herbicide, one to three banded postemergence herbicide applications, or a combination of the banded pre- and postemergence herbicides. All plots were hoed and cultivated as needed to maintain reasonably good control of weeds. The study was a 3-year experiment replicated six times. Unshielded cultivation was superior or equal to shielded cultivation as a weed control measure supplementary to hoeing or hoeing and herbicides as evaluated by effects on hoe-labor requirements, cotton yields, and weed infestations at harvest time. Replacing one or more postemergence herbicide applications with unshielded cultivation resulted in reduced control of weeds. Late season initiation of unshielded cultivation in plots previously shield cultivated had no detrimental effect on yield. Significant increases in yield of cotton were obtained in plots treated with a preemergence herbicide as compared with plots receiving only hoeing and cultivation for weed control. Postemergence herbicide treatments (applied as a directed spray) did not result in significantly higher yields as compared with plots receiving hoeing and cultivation only. As measured by 3-year averages preemergence or postemergence treatments provided about 50 per cent control of weeds; combined they provided about 75 per cent control.
10.2307/4040577|Barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crusgalli (L.) Beauv.) seeds which did not germinate because of low temperature, insufficient moisture, or seed dormancy were exposed to concentrations of ethyl N,N-di-n-propylthiolcarbamate (EPTC) lethal to emerging barnyardgrass seedlings. After different periods of exposure, seeds were removed from the EPTC-treated environments and germinated in untreated soil. Seed germination was not reduced by EPTC and there was no permanent injury to the seedlings. It was concluded that rates of EPTC used for selective weed control do not injure barnyardgrass seeds prior to germination.
10.2307/4040581|The addition of a combination of methyl cellulose, sodium acetate and an alkyl aryl sodium sulfonate (sodium petroleum sulfonate) to spray solutions increased the toxicity of 2,2-dichloropropionic acid (dalapon) to oats and Cynodon dactylon L. The most effective combination tested on oats in the laboratory was 2.25% methyl cellulose, 1.75% sodium acetate, and 0.8% of an alkyl aryl sodium sulfonate. Lower concentrations of the three materials, combinations of any two of these additives, or any one added alone were less effective. Under field conditions, the response of Cynodon dactylon L. to dalapon was more rapid, control was more uniform and regrowth slower when dalapon sprays contained the three additives. Methyl cellulose increased and maintained the spray load on the grass foliage. Alkyl aryl sodium sulfonate probably increased penetration of dalapon. Sodium acetate increased the toxicity of the spray.
10.2307/4040574|A laboratory sprayer for precision application of herbicides to pot cultures consists of a miniature compressed-air sprayer mounted as a pendulum and equipped to automatically spray a pot placed beneath the center of its arc of swing.
10.2307/4040584|Dalapon (2,2-dichloropropionic acid) was applied to a predominantly medusahead (Elymus caput-medusae L.) community at rates of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 lb/A and at four stages of growth. Low rates of dalapon gave better control when applied at early growth stages than the same rates applied later. Reduction in total ground cover was less from December and February applications than from March applications. Dalapon at 3 lb/A applied 30 days after emergence gave 100% kill of medusahead. Two lb/A gave 96% or better control when applied during the vegetative stage (December, February, March). Both 2 and 3 lb/A applied in December, and 2 lb/A in February left a favorable balance of species among the remaining forage plants.
10.2307/4040591|Vegetative propagules of sago pondweed (Potamogeton pectinatus L.) and American pondweed (P. nodosus Poir.) grown under a 14-hr photoperiod of light varying in chromatic composition produced plants with longer internodes and more extensive shoot and stolon development under red light than under blue. Pondweeds grown for 4 weeks under 25 to 400 ft-c of light made progressively more growth at the higher light intensities. Plant weight, branch number and stolon development increased while shoot length and shoot-root decreased with increased light. Pondweeds grown under each of 5 light intensities at temperatures of 60, 70, or 80 F were treated with emulsified xylene or alkyl tolyl methyl trimethyl ammonium chloride. Pondweeds cultured at the higher light intensities and higher temperatures were progressively more injured. Injury from treatment with either herbicide increased with age and plant maturity from early vegetative to flower-bud stage. Equivalent injury was produced on plants of equivalent maturity regardless of chronological age. Pondweeds cultured under 400 ft-c of light and a 14-hr photoperiod required approximately 900 degree-days over a 49 F threshold to reach flower-bud stage.
10.2307/4040576|Amitrole (3-amino-1,2,4-triazole) was applied to purple nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus L.) clones newly established in the field in the Piedmont Plateau. Applications were made one week after initial foliar emergence, then at biweekly intervals through the 20th week. The principal results were: (1) Nutsedge was most susceptible to amitrole applied 4 weeks after initial emergence. The next most susceptible stages were at 1 or 2 weeks; (2) Six weeks after emergence, nutsedge appeared resistant to amitrole; (3) All applications after 10 weeks were relatively ineffective; (4) Chemical analyses of tubers and bulbs indicated a high ash content early in the season, particularly at 6 weeks after emergence.
10.2307/4040587| The absorption and translocation of labeled herbicides by submersed weeds was studied by sealing the immersed root system in a 60 ml polyethylene bottle and immersing the bottle and shoots in water in a 500 ml graduate. The medium for either roots or tops could be treated without affecting the other. Simazine [2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino-1-C)-s-triazine] and fenac [2, 3, 6-trichlorophenylacetic acid-1-C (mixed isomers)] were absorbed by both roots and shoots of waterstargrass (Heteranthera dubia) and translocated to the untreated portion (root or shoot) of the plant. The distribution patterns of C-labeled simazine and fenac in bluegills (Lepomis macrohirus) were studied by gross autoradiography. The viscera of the fish contained the greatest amount of activity. 
10.2307/4040582|Application of 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine (atrazine) was effective in controlling quackgrass (Agropyron repens) in fields planted to corn. Corn yields were greatly improved by the treatment. Most favorable dates of application were in the fall or in the early spring before planting. Applications after corn planting were much less effective. Favorable rates of application were 2 to 4 lb/A. Rates lower than 2 lb/A were not as effective and rates over 8 lb/A were not required. Atrazine and 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine) were generally superior to other triazine analogues used. Greater solubility and greater activity as a foliar spray favors use of atrazine for control of quackgrass.
10.2307/4040590| The disodium salt of 3,6-endoxohexahydrophthalic acid (disodium endothal) and the derivative identified by the manufacturer as the di-N,N-dimethylococoamine salt of endothal (coded as TD-47) were particularly effective upon submersed species of aquatic vegetation as contact herbicides. Disodium endothal at concentrations of 0.5 to 10.0 ppmw was effective in controlling approximately 50 per cent of the 19 species of plants involved in 270 tests. TD-47 at concentrations of 0.02 to 10.0 ppmw trolled 77 per cent of the 11 plant species in 94 tests. Algae (Chara, Cladophora, Pithophora, and Spirogyra) were more effectively controlled by TD-47 than by disodium endothal. Although TD-47 was at least 10 times more herbicidal than disodium endothal, it was about 100 times more toxic to fish. Disodium endothal was more than 50 per cent effective on submersed aquatic plants at rates in excess of 2.5 ppmw with a wide margin of safety in fish (4- to 10-fold). Disodium endothal had a median tolerance limit ranging from 95 to 150 ppmw in the aggregate of nine fish species tested extensively. Median tolerance limits for TD-47 ranged from about 0.06 to 0.3 ppmw for five species of fish. TD-47 applied at a concentration lethal to fish (0.3 to 1.0 ppmw) was effective as a dual management tool in controlling vegetation and achieving partial or complete renovation of stunted fish populations. Young, growing vegetation was most susceptible to control, and best results were achieved at water temperatures exceeding 60 F. Higher rates were required to kill plants as they matured and stands became dense. Endothal liquid formulations were superior to granules in controlling algal mats, floating and emergent plants. Granules were more effective on submersed rooted plants. TD-47 residues were of short duration. The rate of disappearance depended on time and concentration. Detectable residues disappeared within 8 days following application of 0.3 ppmw and within 2 weeks for 0.6 ppmw. However, 1.0 to 3.0 ppmw took up to 25 days to disappear. Some residues were found in fish-food organisms from treated enclosures 3 weeks after application. Fish flesh showed no absorption of endothal-armeens at sublethal concentrations. Intraperitoneal injection of endothal into fish produced a disturbance of the osmoregulation. The physiological effect of endothal was measured by chemical analysis of blood serum. 
10.2307/4040592|Stands of Russian knapweed (Centaurea repens L.) were reduced over 80 per cent by several combinations of crops, cultivation and herbicides. Two of the best crop rotations in a 4-year trial were: (1) a short season of intensive cultivation and a mid-August seeding of bromegrass that was sprayed with 1 lb/A of butoxyethanol ester of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) during June and 1 or 1 1/2 lb/A during August of the second and third years. (2) Bromegrass seeded with an oat companion crop sprayed with 1/3 lb/A of 2,4-D ester the first year and annual applications of 2,4-D in June and mid-August during the second and third years. The best use of non-selective herbicides in two 2-year trials was spring application of 4 lb/A of diethylamine salt of 2,3,6-trichlorobenzoic acid (2,3,6-TBA) or 6 lb/A of diethylamine salt of polychlorobenzoic acid (PBA), plowing 10 days later, and a corn crop sprayed with 1/3 lb/A of 2,4-D ester followed by a spring-seeded oat crop sprayed with 1/3 lb/A of 2,4-D ester and postharvest application of 4 to 6 lb/A of 2,3,6-TBA and 6 to 8 lb/A of PBA, and plowing 10 days later. Reinfestation from established plants was not prevented, but annual application of 2,4-D prevented reinfestation from seedlings.
10.2307/4040585|The fate of 3-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (monuron), 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino)-s-triazine (simazine), and 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-2-triazine (atrazine) in Wymore silty clay loam soil at Lincoln, Bridgeport loam soil at North Platte, and Rosebud loam soil at Alliance, Nebraska, was followed during a 16-month period. Oats grown for 40 days in the field as a bioassay crop showed that simazine and atrazine were less phytotoxic in the finer textured soil where the rainfall was highest. Soybean bioassays in soil from different horizons showed a higher concentration of monuron remaining in the 0- to 3-inch soil horizons than of simazine or atrazine. There was a marked decrease of monuron phytotoxicity in the 3- to 18-inch soil layer 16 months after as compared to 4 months after the herbicide application. Atrazine showed the greatest leaching of the three herbicides in this study.
10.2307/4040578| Spectrophotometric and chemical analyses indicated that photodecomposition of 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid [amiben] in water solution occurred rapidly during exposure to sunlight or light from fluorescent sun lamps. Slow but definite photochemical alteration occurred when dry amiben on filter paper was exposed to light from the sun lamps. Several reaction products were separated by paper chromatography. Loss of herbicidal activity from 10 molar aqueous solutions of amiben approximated disappearance of amiben determined colorimetrically. Photochemical inactivation of the formulated triethylamine salt of amiben in aqueous solution was slower than that of chromatographically pure amiben. A method involving diazotization of amiben with nitrous acid and coupling the diazo form with chromotropic acid was suitable for quantitative determination of amiben. 
10.2307/4040571| Autoradiographs following treatment of Cyperus esculentus L. with C-labeled amitrole indicated that it was readily translocated from the point of application to the seed. Seed germination was significantly reduced following amitrole applications. 
10.2307/4040575| During a 12-hr incubation low concentrations of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) enhance the metabolic breakdown of ribonucleic acid (RNA) whereas high concentrations of the auxin almost completely inhibit RNA breakdown after 4 hr of treatment. The data, from experiments where the incorporation of adenosine-8-C into RNA was followed, clearly show that the role of auxin in this system is not to appreciably alter net synthesis of RNA, but rather to alter some process(s) related to the degradative metabolism of RNA.
