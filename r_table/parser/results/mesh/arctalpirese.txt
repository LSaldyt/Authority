10.2307/1550196|Mt. Castleguard and an adjacent valley, Castleguard Meadows, are situated at the southeastern margin of the Columbia Icefield. The mountain and meadows are underlain by massive Middle Cambrian limestones with some shales and dolomite interbeds; the rocks dip gently southeast. They are well karstified and a close juxtaposition of karst, glacial, and periglacial erosion processes can be observed. Above 2,300 m karst features occur on surfaces recently abandoned by Neoglacial ice, and much meltwater evidently sinks underground beneath the extant glaciers. Outside of Neoglacial margins limestone surfaces are reduced to felsenmeer devoid of karst features. In tundra below 2,300 m shaft-type sinkholes and many varieties of karren occur. Sinkholes are aligned along shale contacts and the distal edges of terminal moraines and are randomly distributed elsewhere. Underground drainage developed in two phases. (1) Castleguard Cave drained part of the central Icefield area downdip to springs at 2,000 m. The cave is a single river passage, longer than 10 km and passing beneath Mt. Castleguard. It has vadose and phreatic erosional elements and is attributed to the last interglacial. (2) In late- or postglacial times, Castleguard Cave was abandoned and a new conduit developed beneath it. This discharges at the "Big Springs" at 1,740 m. Drainage of the northern Meadows and Mt. Castleguard is incorporated into this second system. Discharge of the Big Springs is comparable in magnitude to that of the meltriver of Saskatchewan Glacier, the largest valley glacier draining the Icefield. The area illustrates that karst groundwater circulation may be maintained and even initiated at the soles of temperate glaciers.
10.2307/1551817| Macquarie Island (5435S, 15855E) is a subantarctic island composed of oceanic crustal rocks lifted above sea level during the middle to late Pleistocene. The northern third of its plateau contains large areas of serpentinite and harzburgite. Outcrops of basalt rich in phenocrysts of olivine and pyroxine occur farther south. Where large enough to influence soil formation all these areas are marked by sparse vegetation cover with small, apparently slow-growing plants and a high percentage of bare ground, in sharp contrast to adjacent areas. Soils and plants on serpentinite and harzburgite areas contain high nickel and magnesium, and have lowered calcium/magnesium ratios. There are no species confined to the serpentinite and harzburgite rocks and none is a hyperaccumulator of nickel, presumably because of the short time with respect to evolution that the island has been above sea level. 
10.2307/1550395|A variety of surficial deposits related to three intervals of Neoglaciation occur in valley heads above timberline in the Colorado Front Range. These deposits may be treated as facies, each representing a distinct and separate depositional environment. Frost-riving and rockfall produce detritus over a broad area, but depending upon the environment, it becomes part of either talus, a lobate rock glacier, a tongue-shaped rock glacier, or moraine. No two facies develop simultaneously in the same place. Oscillation of climate causes horizontal shifting and overlapping of facies just as does marine transgression and regression. Thus, geologic and in part climatic history can be inferred from vertical sections, or altitudinal succession can be used as a guide to stratigraphic succession. Differences in topoclimate strongly influence the distribution pattern of the facies as well as some of their sedimentary characteristics. Consequently, these diverse surficial deposits become indicators of topoclimate and microenvironment, past and present.
10.2307/1551425|Early plant succession was examined on a crude-oil damaged wet-sedge meadow, abandoned silt loam roads, and on drilling pads at exploratory wellsites on Alaska's North Slope. Phosphorus fertilization encouraged Carex aquatilis and Dupontia fisheri recolonizing and replacing of seeded Puccinellia borealis where crude-oil damage had occurred 14 yr earlier. After 10 yr, plant cover of graminoids and moss was sufficient to reduce active layer depth about 3.0 cm. On barren, reworked silt loam, phosphorus fertilization promoted natural recolonization. Without fertilization, canopy cover averaged about 65%; with phosphorus fertilization canopy cover averaged over 100%. Bare ground (absence of litter basal and/or plant cover) averaged about 40% without phosphorus fertilization, and with phosphorus, bare ground averaged 12%. Twelve drilling pads constructed 5 to 8 yr earlier were examined for colonizing species. Various combinations of Arctagrostis latifolia, Poa glauca, Poa pratensis, and Festuca rubra had been seeded. Poa pratensis consistently failed. The other three species usually became established. Species diversity of natural pioneering plants was largest on pads in the foothills. Colonization was poorest on unstable sands, saline substrates, and at locations intensely grazed by geese and caribou on the coastal plain. Thirty-six forb, 30 graminoid, and 7 shrub species were colonizing one or more of the drilling pads. Frequent colonizers were (forbs) Senecio congestus, Artemisia tilesii, Cochlearia officinalis, A. alaskana, A. borealis, and Descurainia sophioides. Frequent pioneering grasses, in addition to the three seeded species, were Arctophila fulva, Alopecurus alpinus, and Phippsia algida. Salix planifolia ssp. pulchra was the only shrub colonizing on two or more pads.
10.2307/1551445|The date of snowmelt near Barrow, Alaska, for recent years is determined from radiometric in situ measurements of the tundra solar albedo. The snowmelt dates determined from the albedo measurements dispute recently published values based on routine visual observations at the Barrow National Weather Service (NWS) Office. Local heat-budget-altering effects of the village and its recent abrupt growth are suggested as the cause for the disagreement between the rural albedo and NWS "in town" observations. The open tundra albedo measurements combined with historical NWS observations suggest that there is no significant trend in the date of snowmelt near Barrow.
10.2307/1551289|We studied the reproductive biology in Saxifraga oppositifolia L. (Saxifragaceae) at a subarctic-alpine tundra site at Latnjajaure Field Station, North Swedish Lapland. Saxifraga oppositifolia is a perennial herb with circumpolar distribution, and it is one of the earliest flowering species in its habitats. Late-flowering genets were found to have accelerated phenology; this was correlated with heat acumulation per day. Individual flowers were found to last for 11.7 d. Strongly protogynous flowers (female lasted 4.2 d), declining stigma receptivity at the time of anther dehiscence, and more or less simultaneous flowering within genets reduce the probability for self-pollination. High seed abortion in naturally pollinated flowers (seed:ovule ratio = 0.25) supports this prediction. Crossing experiments showed that seed set is very low from autodeposition of pollen, and almost as low from selfing. Reproductive success was found to be pollen limited.
10.2307/1551410|Small bare areas created by removing debris that had lain on the tundra surface for 30 yr were observed to document recolonization. Recovery was rapid to moderately slow. After 4 yr average plant cover from vegetative colonizers on areas grouped by surrounding vegetation type was greater (9 to 26%) than cover from seedlings (0 to 30%) although seedlings were numerous. Bryophyte cover was 0 to 24%, and lichens were absent. Areas where burning of debris added nutrients had much higher seedling and bryophyte covers. Seedlings were most abundant on mesic or slightly moister sites, were rare on dry, intact organic mats, and absent in standing water. Buried seeds were not an important source of colonizers because they did not survive 30 yr of debris coverage. Seedlings on plots surrounded by successional willow and grass communities on mesic areas of a 30-yr-old disturbance were initially numerous, but then killed by thick litter accumulation. These communities apparently follow the inhibition model of succession and will persist for many years. Sites surrounded by vegetation recovering from disturbance 30 yr ago recolonized faster than plots surrounded by undisturbed vegetation. If possible, development activities that cause small-scale disturbances should be directed to areas of early successional vegetation or vegetation with a high disturbance regime, where recovery can be rapid.
10.2307/1550586|The yield of dissolved materials from a mountain watershed at 2900 m elevation near the Continental Divide in Colorado was computed for 3 yr with very different snowpack conditions. The analysis focuses on the loss of materials during the low-flow season, which extends from fall prior to snow cover through winter. Snowpack was normal the first year, low the second year, and higher than normal the third year. Under a substantial snow cover, the ground surface typically remains unfrozen, whereas bare areas freeze all the way to bedrock. The variation in snowpack thus implies considerable variation in soil frost. The yield of dissolved materials was significantly different between years for Ca
10.2307/1551601| An early to mid-Holocene warm period with greater than present-day monsoonal circulation is indicated by evidence in the northern San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado. Fifty radiocarbon ages of coniferous wood fragments, and several other radiocarbon ages of willow fragments, woody peat, and organic sediment associated with conifer remains, recovered from six sites at or above present-day treeline indicate that during the first half of the Holocene treeline was higher than present. Radiocarbon ages of coniferous wood fragments recovered from the remains of Lake Emma, a former glacial tarn above present-day treeline, indicate that between 9600 and 5400 BP treeline in the northern San Juan Mountains was at least 80 m higher than present. Furthermore, a radiocarbon age of a large spruce fragment with a complacent annual-ring record suggests that at about 8000 BP timberline may have been at least 140 m higher than present. These data suggest that during the early to mid-Holocene average July temperatures were at least 0.5 to 0.9C higher than present. Radiocarbon ages and stratigraphy from bogs in the study area near present-day treeline suggest that between 5400 and 3500 BP treeline was near its present-day limits. After 3500 BP treeline was generally lower than present although short climatic ameliorations, with accompanying rises in treeline, may have occurred at about 3100 and 2400 BP. Deuterium concentrations previously determined for the cellulose of 18 conifer fragments from the Lake Emma site indicate a 70 decrease in deuterium from 9600 BP to present. These data indicate that the early Holocene increase in July solar radiation may have resulted in the intensification of the Arizona monsoon at that time. 
10.2307/1550045|Areas of ground lichen in the subarctic are particularly susceptible to fire either by man's activity or by natural causes. Experimental evidence from the Hudson Bay lowlands gathered in the summer of 1970 indicates that the burning of lichen has a pronounced effect on the ground water regime. Soil moisture measurements made in a mature lichen woodland with thinly spaced trees, and in areas of recent and older burning indicate that the soil moisture under the lichen-dominated surface was at least 40% greater than in either of the burned areas. This suggests that a mature lichen cover offers a high resistance to the evaporation of soil moisture. The nature of the evaporation regime was determined using the energy budget (Bowen Ratio) approach over each surface. These data were augmented by measurements of the moisture content of the lichen made at three levels with the canopy. The evidence indicates that lichen dominated surfaces act as an effective mulch in preventing evaporation from the subsurface zone whereas the burned areas which are able to evaporate more water into the atmosphere when moist, also develop strong resistances to evaporation as the soil surface layers become drier. The role of ground lichen in the water budget of northern lands is significant because of its extensive cover and its destruction by fire must exert an important influence on the hydrologic and atmosphere water regimes.
10.2307/1551969|Almost all the altitudinal belts common to the western part of Eurasia are represented in the Caucasus Mountains. The subnival belt is especially well represented in the Central Caucasus. It lies between the alpine meadows and nival glaciers (from 2900-3000 m a.s.l. to 3600-3700 m a.s.l.). The floristic composition of the subnival belt of the Caucasus is distinguished by a high number of endemic species and some genera. The subnival belt vegetation may be classified into four groups: (1) Separate populations of one or more types are found in a particular habitat. They do not interact with each other; they only have a common habitat. (2) A few populations from several vegetation types grow in groups and form nanocoenoses (small patches). (3) Separate small patches which are fragments of the alpine meadows and "carpets" that find a favorable (snowy and slightly windy slopes) habitat in the subnival belt. (4) Vegetation of certain elements reflecting microhabitats and characterized by nonhomogeneous distributions of species and nanocoenoses.
10.2307/1551115| The effective half-life of the gross beta activity of firn samples from depth cores of the accumulation area of the Kesselwandferner, tztal Alps, Austria, has been measured. With increasing depth the effective half-lives of the samples rise systematically, according to their sequence of deposition. The dependence of the effective half-life from the age of the samples shows that after 5000 d the long-living nuclides
10.2307/1551404|Heather (Calluna vulgaris [L.] Hull), an evergreen dwarf shrub, is the predominant species on great tracts of Scottish moorland over a wide altitudinal range. It flowers annually but seed production is variable and declines substantially with increasing altitude. Heather seeds can, however, accumulate in the soil in huge numbers, up to nearly 100,000 seeds m
10.2307/1551232|Castleguard Cave contains a variety of clastic sediments of both allochthonous and autochthonous origin. The head of the cave, lying beneath the Columbia Icefield, displays breakdown and glaciofluvial injecta that are ancient. Principal deposits in the central cave are the eroded remains of at least three phases of silt filling. These are interpreted as varved sequences deposited under full glacial conditions. They are older than 140,000 BP. A channel abandonment facies occupies the inner part of the downstream entrance complex. The outer part is prone to flooding today and contains a remarkable shingle beach formed in situ where floodwaters must rise vertically.
10.2307/1550181|Freezeup conditions in the beach and nearshore zone at Radstock Bay in the fall of 1971 are described and provide a basis for a more general discussion of the factors involved. The timing and duration of the freezeup process and the type of ice conditions produced at the shore are considered. The basic control on the process is the rate at which temperature declines in the fall; but wind and wave conditions, the type and amount of pack ice present both offshore and at the beach, and the amount of snowfall in the period are of major significance. In 1971, the final immobilization of the beach did not occur until October 4, though the process began a month earlier; storm-wave action and the grounding of resistant pack ice at the shore were important.
10.2307/1550832|The annual demographic changes and height increments of small, isolated, tree-limit stands of Pinus sylvestris L. (considered collectively as a single population) were studied during a 10-yr period (1972 to 1981). The individual vitality of specimens forming the population was also followed in detail throughout the study period. No recruitment to the population was recorded during the study period and the population size (total number of live plants) decreased by ca. 13%. The demographic changes were basically controlled by intrinsic factors but proximately executed by damage related to the annual differences in the air temperatures recorded during the initial 2 to 3 mon of the year. Long periods of radiation-controlled high temperatures during these months apparently lower the frost-hardiness, and the young pines, in particular, suffer serious damage by the subsequent onset of low temperatures. The individuals forming such isolated and small-sized tree-limit populations appear to be especially susceptible to this type of damage. Tree vitality in general, and the reproductive phase of life-cycle in particular, may suffer due to selfing and inbreeding. Such populations of pine seem therefore to be doomed to complete extinction, or to very drastic reduction in size within a rather short time after establishment (30 to 40 yr). The Holocene tree-limit history of pine in Scandinavia is briefly discussed in the light of this finding.
10.2307/1551019| Radiocarbon evidence, isostatic uplift data, and glacial landforms in the Ungava Peninsula have provided important insight into the nature and dispersal pattern of the late Wisconsin ice sheets in northeastern Canada. A shell date of 37,000400 BP from the Hudson Strait coast of Ungava indicates that at least the coastal area of Ungava may have been deglaciated during the last glacial period. Subsequently, an ice sheet developed over the entire peninsula, leaving, as a heritage, a symmetrical sequence of landform assemblages. The latter, along with striae, flutings, and drumlinoid features, indicate radial flow of the ice sheet towards Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, and Ungava Bay from a dispersal center in the interior. The ice sheet may have been cold-based in the vicinity of the ice divide, becoming warm-based towards its margins. A thick unmoulded till plain, situated along the ice divide, is speculatively thought to be inherited from beneath an earlier and thicker ice sheet. The earliest withdrawal of late Wisconsin ice inland from the coastal regions took place ca. 10,000 BP in the Rivire Dception--Cap de la Nouvelle-France area in northeastern Ungava. Locally high marine limits on the offshore islands in the vicinity support the concept of ice withdrawal to a stable position inland on the Ungava plateau. By 8000 BP the entire Hudson Strait coast and the northwestern part of Ungava Bay were ice free. The ice front was actively calving inland from Hudson Bay. An important lobe of central Quebec-Labrador ice probably filled southern Ungava Bay until as late as 6500 to 7000 BP, accounting for the existence of glacial lakes in the valleys of several of its tributary rivers, and possibly a negative gravity anomaly in the same region. Marine-limit elevations suggest that the Ungava ice sheet resulted in equivalent glacial loading on both the Hudson and Ungava Bay coasts, and that the thickest ice masses were situated to the south of the Ungava Peninsula along the axis between southeastern Hudson Bay and central Quebec-Labrador. 
10.2307/1551071|A total of about 80 species of Collembola were extracted from 87 qualitative samples mainly from alpine and subalpine sites in the Front Range of Colorado (Boulder, Gilpin, Grand, Clear Creek, and Larimer counties). The following seven new species are described: Friesea pati n.sp., Stachorutes navajellus n.sp., Anurophorus elongatus n.sp., A. senex n.sp., Folsomia variablis n.sp., F. evansi n.sp., and Bourletiella (B.) pisifera n.sp. Characteristic associations of species were found in several habitats, in particular in alpine snow-edge communities (Ceratophysella sp., Isotoma uniens, I. sp.) and alpine dry meadows (dominated by Anurophorus elongatus n.sp.). Compared with the northern parts of the Rocky Mountain Cordillera (Alaska, Washington) there is a remarkable absence of species of the Anurida complex in the Colorado Front Range.
10.2307/1550141|A review is given of the origin, history, and use of the terms subarctic and subalpine. It is suggested that North American scientists join in the European trend towards a standardization of the nomenclature for latitudinal zones and altitudinal belts. The subarctic zone and the subalpine belt are redefined as covering the forest-tundra ecotone at high latitudes and high altitudes respectively.
10.2307/1551423|Proposed construction in Denali National Park will disturb alpine and subalpine vegetation. On some disturbed areas, plant succession is predicted to be slow and to produce a sparse plant cover. Studies are in progress to evaluate methods and native plant materials for assisted revegetation. Ten species which are important members of natural successional communities are currently being tested to determine if planting seedlings will increase their density and cover. Seeds were collected in the Park and greenhouse-propagated in containers. Treatment combinations of planted seedlings, fertilization, and watering are being tested at a disturbed alpine site, while treatment combinations of planted seedlings and topsoil addition are being tested at a subalpine disturbed site. In spite of exceptionally hot, dry weather, 96% of the planted seedlings at the alpine study site and 94% of the seedlings at the subalpine site were alive and growing after one growing season. Watering, fertilization, and topsoil treatments had little effect on first-year survival. These early results suggest that planting containerized seedlings may be an effective method to increase native plant cover on disturbed areas. However, revegetation treatments will be evaluated for several growing seasons to determine their effectiveness in increasing plant density and cover.
10.2307/1552011| Individuals of Sphagnum capillifolium were cultured for 2 mo under six different combinations of nighttime temperature and nutrients. Low nighttime temperature caused a five-fold reduction of growth. Growth was also reduced when the plants were cultured without any addition of nutrient in the growing medium, but only when nutrient deficiency was coupled with high nighttime temperature. Growth reduction was associated with decreased rates of net photosynthesis, but was not accompanied by a degradation of photosynthetic pigments and/or variations in the pigment ratios, nor was the ultrastructure of chloroplasts significantly altered. The decline in the net photosynthetic rate may be due to a limitation in the enzymatic reactions at unfavorable temperatures. Nitrogen and, especially, phosphorus appeared to limit growth of Sphagnum capillifolium at optimal temperatures. A nighttime temperature of 5C was above the lower threshold triggering the synthesis of red wall-pigments, known to be promoted by nighttime chilling. Climate warming is expected to increase the growth rates of Sphagnum, but the consequences on the carbon balance of peatlands cannot be predicted because temperature rise may also enhance breakdown of peat. 
10.2307/1550142|Mass-balance studies, based primarily on the determination of net mass balance as indicated by a network of point measurements on the surface of the glacier, were begun in 1967. In 1967, a specific mass balance of 0.81 m of water equivalent was measured; in 1968, this value dropped to 0.53 m. This positive mass balance during the two years of study appears to be primarily related to local topoclimatological controls.
10.2307/1551264| The developmental stages of 142 alpine plant species were observed during 1984/85 in the grassland site of Rudranath bughiyal (3028N, 7920E; 3250 to 4200 m) in the Central Himalayan region. The growth initiation synchronized with the beginning of the spring temperature rise and the resultant snowmelt, and peaked after 30 to 40 d. In this alpine grassland, the peaks of the various phenophases succeeded one after another over about 4 mo, from early June to early October. This study supports the notion that in the unfavorable environment of the high elevations the primary plant strategy is to complete the growth cycle rapidly in order to assure the survival of the species. 
10.2307/1551753| Past treelines can rarely be recorded by pollen percentages alone, but pollen concentration, pollen influx, and plant macrofossils (including stomata of conifers) are more reliable indicators. In addition, ancient forest soils above today's treeline may trace the maximum upper expansion of the forest since the last glaciation. Charcoal in such soil profiles may be radiocarbon dated. Our example from the Central Swiss Alps at the Alpe d'Essertse consists of a plant-macrofossil diagram and pollen diagrams of the pond Gouill Rion at 2343 m a.s.l. and a sequence of soil profiles from 1780 m to 2600 m a.s.l. The area around the pond was forested with Larix decidua and Pinus cembra between 9500 and 3600 BP. After 4700 BP the forest became more open and Juniperus nana and Alnus viridis expanded (together with Picea abies in the subalpine forest). Between 1700 and 900 BP the Juniperus nana and Alnus viridis scrubs declined while meadows and pastures took over, so that the pond Gouill Rion was definitively above timberline. The highest Holocene treeline was at 2400 to 2450 m a.s.l. (i.e. 50 to 100 m higher than the uppermost single specimen of Pinus cembra today) between 9000 and 4700 BP, but it is not yet dated in more detail. The highest charcoal of Pinus cembra at 2380 m a.s.l. has a radiocarbon date of 6010  70 BP. Around 6900 BP a strong climatic deterioration caused an opening of timberline forest. First indicators of anthropogenic influence occurred at 4700 BP, when the forest limit started to move down. The lowering of timberline after 4700 BP was probably due to combined effects of human and climatic impact. 
10.2307/1550884| To determine if the soil bacterial community exhibited a response to perturbations from acid rain, the effects of increased soil loading rates of acid precipitation, nitrate, and sulfate on the alpine tundra soil bacterial community were investigated under field conditions along Niwot Ridge, Colorado. During late June and July three concentrations, in a total volume of 10 liters representing 2.5, 5, and 10 times the normal soil loading rates of H
10.2307/1551518|An electronic load-cell weighing lysimeter was used for measuring daily evapotranspiration from the alpine tundra on Niwot Ridge in the Front Range, Colorado, during the 1987 growing season. Concomitant measurements of net radiation, insolation, ground heat flux, and the gradients of wind, temperature, and humidity in the lower atmosphere are used to evaluate factors that govern temporal variations in evapotranspiration from four sites in a dry alpine meadow. Evapotranspiration was governed by energy availability for 3 to 5 d after precipitation events; thereafter, the rate at which the gradually drying soil could deliver water to the evaporating surface appeared to become an increasingly important control over evapotranspiration. Advection of cold, dry air from the Continental Divide increased both the vertical temperature and specific humidity gradients 100% over what would have occurred if advection were not present. Since the effect of advection on these gradients was approximately equivalent, both the sensible and latent heat fluxes were augmented at the expense of the ground heat flux. A primary effect of advection is to reduce the temperature of the alpine tundra surface.
10.2307/1551365| Results of lichenometry and rock-weathering studies on outer moraines in Skdadalur, Eyjafjrdur, northern Iceland show a late Little Ice Age 19th century maximum for all glaciers except the Klaengshll glacier. Retreat from these maximum positions occurred in three distinct phases: 1896-1908, 1915-1926, and post-1930. Evidence suggests, however, that many glaciers must have reached a position close to the Little Ice Age maximum on at least one other occasion earlier in the Neoglacial. 
10.2307/1550020|Thirty-five species of seed plants were isolated by germination from wind-blown debris collected on the surface of St. Mary's Glacier at about 3,350 m. In addition, viable parts of Polytrichum piliferum, Selaginella densa, and four lichens were identified. Among the seed plants, bulblets of Bistorta vivipara (Polygonum viviparum) were by far the most numerous, followed by seeds of Minuartia obtusiloba (Arenaria obtusiloba) and Saxifraga rhomboidea. Disseminule transport in the direction of the strong winds from the west appears to be significant for many alpine species despite general lack of special adaptations. Such transport would appear to overcome some geographical isolating factors but results in considerable loss of disseminules by some species.
10.2307/1551088| A 1-km-wide glacier-pushed complex produced by a surge of Holmstrmbreen in Ekmanfjorden (Spitsbergen) is suffering deflation, which is tending to plane off the original relief and to truncate folded structures in the pushed complex. Similar rapid eolian erosion could account for planation of the Saalian pushed ridges in The Netherlands. The resultant eolian sediments are dispersed onto mudflats beyond the pushed complex. Part of the coarse-silt and fine-sand fractions seems to be transported farther and is probably blown out into the fiord. The coarser sand fractions are deposited closer to the source and tend to lose their mica components rapidly, presumably due to differentiation during transport and/or grain comminutions. The textures of the wind-blown sands approximate rather closely those of a number of Dutch coversand.
