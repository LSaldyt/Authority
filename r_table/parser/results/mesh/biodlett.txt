10.2307/2999752|In New Caledonia, protected areas exist only on Grande Terre (mainly in the south of the main island, 16,500 km<sup>2</sup>) These land areas have been created either for their wealth of endemic plants, for their fauna, or to meet the needs of the population (protection of water supplies, tourist sites) Whatever their aims, in practice they protect only two types of plant formation: evergreen forest and maquis on ultrabasic substrates (South), covering only about 9% of the total area This low percentage makes it necessary to (a) increase the surface protected for the formations involved; (b) create protection zones urgently in the following formations not yet covered: mangrove, evergreen forest on schists and on limestone (Loyalty Islands) and sclerophyll forest; and (c) list the species exhibiting disjunct distributions and institute measures to protect their sites
10.2307/2999714|Data on the species distributions of twelve higher taxa of animals and plants are used to explore the extent to which hotspots of species richness tend to coincide across Europe on an equal area grid (squares of approximately 152,000 km<sup>2</sup>). One or two of the hotspots of many of the numerous possible pairwise combinations of higher taxa are congruent, but for no pair of higher taxa do three hotspots coincide. Contrasted with a simple null model, there is a greater incidence of positive associations of hotspots between higher taxa than expected, and more areas contain several hotspots than expected The overall numbers of species of all higher taxa, found within the hotspots of individual higher taxa, are very consistent 50-56% of all species occurred in the richest hotspots, and 60-70% in the top three hotspots.
