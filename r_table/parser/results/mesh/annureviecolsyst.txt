2678636|The functional causes of life history trade-offs have been a topic of interest to evolutionary biologists for over six decades. Our review of life history trade-offs discusses conceptual issues associated with physiological aspects of trade-offs, and it describes recent advances on this topic. We focus on studies of four model systems: wing polymorphic insects, Drosophila, lizards, and birds. The most significant recent advances have been: (a) incorporation of genetics in physiological studies of trade-offs, (b) integration of investigations of nutrient input with nutrient allocation, (c) development of more sophisticated models of resource acquisition and allocation, (d) a shift to more integrated, multidisciplinary studies of intraspecific trade-offs, and (e) the first detailed investigations of the endocrine regulation of life history trade-offs.
221717|Heterotrophic bacteria perform two major functions in the transformation of organic matter: They produce new bacterial biomass (bacterial secondary production [BP]), and they respire organic C to inorganic C (bacterial respiration [BR]). For planktonic bacteria, a great deal has been learned about BP and its regulation during the past several decades but far less has been learned about BR. Our lack of knowledge about BR limits our ability to understand the role of bacteria in the carbon cycle of aquatic ecosystems. Bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) is the amount of new bacterial biomass produced per unit of organic C substrate assimilated and is a way to relate BP and BR: BGE = (BP)/(BP + BR). Estimates of BGE for natural planktonic bacteria range from <0.05 to as high as 0.6, but little is known about what might regulate this enormous range. In this paper we review the physiological and ecological bases of the regulation of BGE. Further, we assemble the literature of the past 30 years for which both BP and BR were measured in natural planktonic ecosystems and explore the relationship between BGE and BP. Although the relationship is variable, BGE varies systematically with BP and the trophic richness of the ecosystem. In the most dilute, oligotrophic systems, BGE is as low as 0.01; in the most eutrophic systems, it plateaus near 0.5. Planktonic bacteria appear to maximize carbon utilization rather than BGE. A consequence of this strategy is that maintenance energy costs (and therefore maintenance respiration) seems to be highest in oligotrophic systems.
2678644|The world's population is concentrated in urban areas. This change in demography has brought landscape transformations that have a number of documented effects on stream ecosystems. The most consistent and pervasive effect is an increase in impervious surface cover within urban catchments, which alters the hydrology and geomorphology of streams. This results in predictable changes in stream habitat. In addition to imperviousness, runoff from urbanized surfaces as well as municipal and industrial discharges result in increased loading of nutrients, metals, pesticides, and other contaminants to streams. These changes result in consistent declines in the richness of algal, invertebrate, and fish communities in urban streams. Although understudied in urban streams, ecosystem processes are also affected by urbanization. Urban streams represent opportunities for ecologists interested in studying disturbance and contributing to more effective landscape management.
221701|Geographic patterns in mtDNA variation are compiled for 22 species of freshwater and terrestrial turtles in the southeastern United States, and the results are employed to evaluate phylogeographic hypotheses and principles of genealogical concordance derived previously from similar analyses of other vertebrates in the region. The comparative molecular findings are interpreted in the context of intraspecific systematics for these taxa, the historical geology of the area, traditional nonmolecular zoogeographic information, and conservation significance. A considerable degree of phylogeographic concordance is registered with respect to (a) the configuration of intraspecific mtDNA subdivisions across turtle species, (b) the principal molecular partitions and traditional morphology-based taxonomic boundaries, (c) genetic patterns in turtles versus those described previously for freshwater fishes and terrestrial vertebrates in the region, and (d) intraspecific molecular subdivisions versus the boundaries between major zoogeographic provinces as identified by composite ranges of species in the Testudines. Findings demonstrate shared elements in the biogeographic histories of a diverse regional biota. Such phylogeographic concordances (and discordances) have ramifications for evolutionary theory as well as for the pragmatic efforts of taxonomy and conservation biology.
2097221|The importance of genetic interactions in the evolutionary process has been debated for more than half a century. Genetic interactions such as underdominance and epistasis (the interaction among genetic loci in their effects on phenotypes or fitness) can play a special role in the evolutionary process because they can create multiple fitness optima (adaptive peaks) separated by fitness minima (adaptive valleys). The valleys prevent deterministic evolution from one peak to another. We review the evidence that genetic interaction is a common phenomenon in natural populations. Some studies give strong circumstantial evidence for multiple fitness peaks, although the mapping of epistatic interactions onto fitness surfaces remains incompletely explored, and absolute proof that multiple peaks exist can be shown to be empirically impossible. We show that there are many reasons that epistatic polymorphism is very difficult to find, even when interactions are an extremely important part of the genetic system. When polymorphism results in the presence of multiple fitness peaks within a group of interbreeding populations, one fitness peak will quickly be nearly fixed within all interbreeding populations, but when epistatic or underdominant loci are nearly fixed, there will be no direct evidence of genetic interaction. Thus when complex landscapes are evolutionarily most important, evidence for alternative high fitness genetic combinations will be most ephemeral. Genetic interactions have been most clearly demonstrated in wide crosses within species and among closely related species. This evidence suggests that genetic interactions may play an important role in taxonomic diversification and species-level constraints. Population genetic analyses linked with new approaches in metabolic and molecular genetic research are likely to provide exciting new insights into the role of gene interactions in the evolutionary process.
2952501|Trophic structure, the partitioning of biomass among trophic levels, is a major characteristic of ecosystems. Most studies of the forces that shape trophic structure emphasize either "bottom-up" or "top-down" regulation of populations and communities. Recent work has shown that these two forces are not mutually exclusive alternatives, but efforts to model their interaction still often yield unrealistic predictions. We focus on the problems involved with modeling situations in which community composition, including both the number of trophic levels and the species composition within a trophic level, can change. We review the development of these ideas, emphasizing in particular how compositional change can alter theoretical expectations about the regulation of trophic structure. A comparison of studies on the effects of predators and resource productivity in limnetic ecosystems reveals an intriguing disparity between the results of manipulative experiments and those of correlational studies. We suggest that this contrast is a result of the difference in the temporal scales operating in the two types of studies. Ecosystem-level variables may appear to approach an equilibrium in short-term press experiments; however, processes such as invasion and extinction of species will not have time to play out in most such experiments. We found that the responses of ecosystems to short-term experimental treatments involve less change in species composition than is found in natural communities that have diverged in response to local conditions over longer periods. We argue that the results of short-term experiments support the predictions of models in which the species pool does not change, whereas correlational studies among systems support theories that incorporate compositional change.
