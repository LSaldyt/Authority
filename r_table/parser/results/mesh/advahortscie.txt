42883353|The cultivar Meski is one of the most widely planted olive cultivars in Tunisia. However, because of self-incompatibility, cross pollination is needed. Understanding of the correlation between the phenological stages and flower development can be helpful in choosing the right time for pollination in selecting suitable pollenizers for the Meski cultivar. In this work, floral biology in relation to phenological stages of six olive cultivars was studied to obtain a comprehensive description of suitable pollenizers for 'Meski'. The level of flowering, pistillate inflorescences, viability and germination rates of pollen grains were determined for each cultivar. The flowering period of the six tested cultivars was recorded in order to determine if their flowering duration coincides fully with the bloom period of 'Meski'. Viability, germination and pollen tube elongation abilities of all the cultivars were tested. Comparison of pollen viability of all the cultivars was done using acetocarmin staining technique and the fluorescein diacetate test. The pollen showed little loss in viability and germinability over the tested storage period at -18C. The productive characters of six olive cultivars showed a good productive behaviour of Besbessi, Picholine, Zarrazi, Arbequina and Ascolana cultivars with particular interest for 'Zarrazi' and 'Besbessi'. Regarding pollen characteristics, 'Zarrazi' and 'Besbessi' reflected better pollen quality while the evaluation of flower quality and bloom showed good performance in all cultivars except for 'Manzanille'.
24586787|Modern agricultural practices are mostly directed toward high application of commercial fertilizers to achieve high yield. It is widely recognized that application of fertilizer (especially nitrogen) can cause ground water pollution by nitrate leaching through the soil profile. A new approach to farming is often referred to as sustainable agriculture and it seeks to introduce friendlier agricultural practices to the environment and maintains the long term ecological balance of the soil ecosystem. Hence investigations were carried out to develop nutrient management for strawberry cultivar Sweet Charley subjected to various treatment combinations of organic and inorganic fertilizers. Traits such as plant growth characteristics (leaves/plant and plant spread), yield characteristics (flower buds, fruits per plant and fruit yield tons/ha) and quality characteristics (juice content, total sugar content, vitamin C and specific gravity) were observed. The runners of strawberry cv. Sweet Charley were planted in the first week of November with a spacing of 30 x 60 cm. The investigation was laid out in a randomized block design with five treatment combinations replicated thrice. The data regarding the different growth parameters observed at 30, 45, 60, 90, 105, 120, yield parameters at 45, 60, 90, 120, 135, 150 days after planting and their quality parameters clearly indicate that the application of integrated sources of nutrients significantly affect the vegetative, reproductive and yield characteristics of the strawberry plant. However the manure fertilizer combination under treatment T4 (75% Organic Fertilizers + 25% inorganic Fertilizers) was found to be the best treatment with regard to integrated and combined application of nutrient resources for strawberry cultivation in India.
42882926|The effects of active modified atmospheres were evaluated in 'Giombo' persimmons with tannins already removed (non-astringent) and stored at 0C and 85-90% relative humidity for 35 days. The goal was to maintain quality and delay ripening. The fruits were picked by hand when they were about 50% green, sanitized and subjected to different mixtures of CO and O. Fruits were wrapped in thin film plastic made of nylon + polyethylene and analyzed every seven days for weight loss, respiratory activity, coloration, titratable acidity, soluble solids, ratio, pH, firmness, pectin methyl esterase and polygalacturonase enzyme activities, reducing sugars, ascorbic acid and astringency index. Refrigerated storage and active modified atmospheres were effective in conserving the quality of 'Giombo' persimmons. The fruits submitted to the highest CO concentrations (7 and 8%) had the lowest weight loss and respiratory intensity with a delay in the climacteric peak.
42881747|A study of background colour as a harvesting index for peaches and nectarines was undertaken to achieve fruit of better and more uniform quality with resistance to handling. For each cultivar, the background colour matching the most advanced maturity stage at which fruit retained a firmness greater than 5 kg was selected as a reference, and colour charts were prepared accordingly. The fruit selected according to these colour charts remained firm after short storage and was more uniform, within each orchard and harvest, than normally harvested fruit as to background colour, soluble solids and firmness. A background-colour chart is a useful tool for harvesting peaches and nectarines of better and more uniform internal quality.
42882603|Three pot experiments were conducted in a temperature-controlled greenhouse at Newe Ya'ar Research Center in order to determine the limits of depth for germination and emergence in squash (Cucurbita pepo). There were no depth limitations to germination down to 12 cm in four different media. The mean emergence percentages of two accessions in four media were 78, 57, 26 and 2% from 1, 4, 8 and 12 cm, respectively. Seed size (weight) did not affect the emergence percentage based on findings of two experiments: one demonstrated similar emergence percentages of two accessions differing markedly in seed weight; the other demonstrated similar emergence percentages of different-sized seeds in each of these accessions. The effects of medium on emergence were mostly non-significant. However, the tuff medium (volcanic gravel with large particles) was less favorable than the other media, with lower emergence percentages and slower seedling development.
42883199|'Miho' satsumas received an anaerobic treatment with N or CO for 24 hr at 20C before being waxed with shellac and transferred to 20C for 30 days, in order to measure respiration rate, internal gas evolution (CO and O) and peel resistance to CO diffusion. Ethanol in the juice, as well as taste and appearance were also determined. Respiration rate decreased by more than half following 30 days of storage, while internal CO and O rose and decreased, respectively. Conversely, resistance to CO diffusion increased drastically with time in storage. Waxing significantly decreased respiration rate and doubled resistance to CO diffusion, while anaerobic treatments did not influence physiological parameters. Off-flavour development due to time in storage or wax application strongly affected taste of fruits. Exposition to CO negatively influenced fruit taste also, with respect to control and N exposed fruits. In general, the higher the ethanol content in the juice, the higher the off-flavour score and the lower the acceptability by panellists. The external fruit appearance declined with time in storage. Waxing or anaerobic treated fruits maintained a better freshness than control fruits. From a commercial standpoint the best result was gained with non-waxed nitrogen-treated fruits, which stored satisfactorily for 10 days.
42881339|A study carried out with the mild mutant M-1 obtained from a P strain, is reported. It was used for cross protection against the severe strain PepMV 10 on a pepper cultivation in greenhouse. Its influence on flowering and yield was analyzed, using the TMV susceptible cultivar XPH 833 and the resistant one NUN 3364. In the first cultivar, M-1 does not affect the susceptible plant flowering and it is also efficient in cross protection, whereas the flowering of plants inoculated with PepMV 10 was lower. The early yield of M-1 inoculated plants was identical to that of the control, but it became lower in challenged plants and in those inoculated with PepMV 10. The total yield of cv. XPH 833 was unaffected in the plants inoculated with M-1 and in those challenged, but it decreased in the PepMV 10 inoculated plants. These findings were confirmed by using the cv NUN 3364, but this variety was quite susceptible to the mutant. It was also susceptible to all the other inoculations made, so, it could be considered as a varietal susceptibility. Thus, M-1 might be proposed as a protective strain, but detailed studies of its diffusion within the plant and the concentration of the challenge inoculum required to infect protected plants in natural conditions are needed.
42881759|Root development was examined in roots of young olive trees (Olea europaea L., cv. Manzanillo) grown under wet and dry water regimes. Cross sections at sequential positions were observed along the root axis from the apex up to 18 cm from the root tip at intervals of 3 cm. An index was established to facilitate development comparisons. Complete transition to secondary growth was found closer to the apex in the roots grown in dry soil (at 9 cm) than in the roots grown in watered soil (at 12 cm). Up to 5 cm from the root tip, the cortical tissue was wider in the roots grown in dry soil than in watered soil. Based on maturity stage, both total root and central cylinder radii were greater for the dry than the irrigated treatment. No difference between treatments was found in metaxylem vessel diameter.
42882698|This review first revisits current knowledge about single-leaf function, viz. photosynthesis, chiefly in relation to environmental factors, that underscores the importance of multiple summer stresses. Emphasis is placed on the response different genotypes show under light and heat stress with or without soil-water shortage. Secondly, it tackles the thorny issue of extrapolating single-leaf readings to the whole-canopy level, with special reference to both methodological and physiological implications. Whole-canopy gas-exchange systems deliver and emphasise the usefulness of such an approach in achieving key research goals. One case in point is quantifying the amount and dynamics of canopy gas exchange in response to summer pruning, which alters a canopy's leaf population. Other examples show how useful a whole-canopy approach can be in monitoring diurnal or seasonal variation in light interception, photosynthesis and water use, or when the need is for an objective validation tool to assess the precision of models devised to predict carbon budget. The discussion of some of these case studies attempts to explain why conclusions driven by single-leaf surveys can at times diverge from those derived from a whole-canopy approach. The overall intent of the review is to highlight the single-leaf approach, especially when performed under a methodology suitable to the objectives, as well as the effectiveness of the whole-canopy approach, even limited by the small number of replicates, in understanding the whole vine behaviour. Indeed, the bottom line seems to be that conducting both single-leaf and whole-canopy measurements in the same experimental plot is an added value to research and can be reliably employed to judge the efficiency of different training systems.
42881854|The growth rates, yields and protein content of Amaranthus cruentos, L. and Sesamum radiatum, Schum. were studied at different levels of nitrogen application under rainfed conditions in the Guinea savanna ecological zone of Nigeria. Nitrogen application was 0,45,90 and 180 kg N ha for amaranth and 0,30,60 and 90 kg N ha for sesame. The results showed that at the highest level of N application, amaranth (a C4 plant) had a very high growth rate coefficient (0.471 ha day) before cutting while the growth rate coefficient of sesame (a C3 plant) was lower (0.221 ha day). The growth rate coefficients of both plants were drastically reduced after cutting; the values were 0.21 and 0.07 (ha day for amaranth and sesame, respectively. Total shoot and leaf dry matter yields increased significantly up to 45 and 60 kg N ha, for amaranth and sesame, respectively. The crude protein contents of the leaves at first harvest of amaranth and sesame were high and averaged about 30% on a dry weight basis.
42883430|Several aspects of pomegranate flower biology are addressed. Clones PTO1, PTO2, ME14 and ME15 were used in the study, all of them Spanish cultivars from the provinces of Murcia (the first two) and Alicante (the latter two). Pistil receptiveness was assessed by the "fruit set" method. Selected flowers were emasculated and later pollinated with either their own or foreign pollen grains from other cultivars; afterwards fruit set was quantified. Likewise, effective pollination time was also calculated. While all pomegranate clones showed a pistil receptiveness of seven days, ME15 yielded a receptiveness of just six days. The highest fruit set percentage was achieved one day before anthesis and two days after. Clone ME15 yielded an effective pollination time (EPT) of four days, whereas the others (PTO1, PTO2 and ME14) showed an EPT of five days.
42882631|In Italy the number of olive cultivars is extremely high, and together with the best known and widespread ones, in the collections numerous minor local cultivars and ecotypes exist which have not been sufficiently characterized. In Emilia Romagna this aspect is less evident, but nevertheless a great number of old olive trees and bushed is present on the northern slopes of the Apennins, to witness an olive cultivation which has always been present since the times of the Roman Empire. Many of these genotypes have been collected and characterized as not belonging to cultivars presently known, but which might have been cultivated in distant times. This kind of olive genetic diversity was studied using SSR technique, on plants growing in the Bologna area (IT). For genotype identification comparisons were made with a number of important cultivars of Central Italy. Screening was obtained by analysing patterns produced by 17 SSR primers. A dendrogram obtained from the analysis reveals the presence of an interesting amount of genetic diversity among the studied individuals.
42883079|Sexual crosses of Lycopersicon esculentum (LE) with two L. peruvianum (LP) accessions from 850 m above sea level (asl) (LP 850) and from 1650 m asi (LP 1650) were analysed for the temperature responses of photochemical chlorophyll (chi) fluorescence quenching (qp) before and after long-term chilling under low light and compared to the behaviour of their respective parental lines. Photosynthesis rates as a function of temperature were assayed in chilled and control plants of the parental lines as well as in the cross LE  LP 1650. The previously reported ability of LP 1650 for low-temperature acclimation of photosynthetic dark reactions, as visualized in increasing qp values at suboptimal temperatures, was also present in its hybrid with LE. This hybrid is only achievable through the embryo rescue technique. In contrast, the hybrid between LE and LP 850, which can be obtained by simple pollination of LE, revealed no cold acclimation of photosynthesis, nor did either parental line. It is suggested that the self-compatible LP 1650 accession is an interesting genotype for the introgression of genes for low-temperature tolerance into the cultivated tomato.
42881642|Stem cuttings of Flordabelle (FB) and Flordagold (FG) peach cultivars were prepared during mid-June and mid-August to investigate the origin of adventitious roots and the role of sclerenchyma tissue as related to nodal anatomy. The results show that FB and FG peach stems contain three leaf gaps (trilacunar type) immediately below the node area, where the median leaf trace is largest. The origin of the traces is the central core of the vascular tissue. Three orders of emergence for the leaf traces were observed, which are affected by the distance of sectioning made below the node. Moreover, the appearance of the traces leads to the formation of gaps which are either associated with the traces in the area below the node, or they disappear where the traces are freed from the vascular tissue, leading to the formation of a large gap. The results also show that no preformed roots are present; thus adventitious roots in FB and FG are either of nodal or internodal origin. In addition, parenchyma of all leaf gaps, such as parenchymatic tissue outside the trace, parenchyma immediately interior to the bud scales and xylem parenchyma are the origin of adventitious roots. The sclerenchyma ring in the area of leaf and bud gaps of both cultivars is not present.
42881595|One-year-old grafts of Prunus avium (scion) on Prunus cerasus (rootstock) were sampled at the beginning of July when slight symptoms of leaf yellowing appeared. Phenols were analyzed from the stem portions 0-3 mm above and below the union respectively. Steep gradients between scion and rootstock were formed by genistin, prunin, isosakuranin, chrysin-7-glucoside and dihydrowogonin-7-glucoside, all of them being higher in amounts in the scion. Prunetin-5-glucoside, tectochrysin-5-glucoside and pinostrobin-5-glucoside were found only in the rootstock. Some flavanols accumulated more strongly in the scion as compared with the rootstock. The presence of steep phenol gradients in the opposing cells of Prunus grafts favours the view that slight and delayed incompatibility might be caused by those phenols which move outwards from their original compartments.
42882486|The report aims at improving knowledge of the interaction between poplar and heavy metals and at parsing the poplar ability to remove or render harmless such inorganic elements contained in residual slags of leather industries. Scions of Populus  euramericana, clone 1-214, were grown outdoors, in pots, in inert soil, pruned for a single shoot and subjected to three treatments: non-amended (C), amended with a commercial mould (M), amended with tannery waste (W). The tannery waste consisted of a complex matrix composed of slags deriving from leather processing and containing different amounts of heavy metals, particularly trivalent chromium. Non-destructive measurements were taken during one growing season; plant biomass and heavy metals content were analysed at the end of cultivation. Plants reared in the W soil developed stem length, leaf area and biomass significantly greater than those of the other treatments. Values of B, Mn, Fe, Zn and Cr in some of the vegetative organs also demonstrated that the clone 1-214 uptakes significant amounts of these metals. According to the results, further studies should be planned to test both the toxicity risks of higher amounts of leather industry wastes and the phytoremediation ability of Populus  euramericana.
42881352|Climatic data and the incidence of asparagus rust (Puccinia asparagi D.C.) were recorded from 1991 and 1992 on two experimental fields in the two most important asparagus-growing areas of the Veneto region in Italy. One site was also monitored for 1993. Disease incidence was assessed by fortnightly records of the number of uredia or telia/plants; climatic data included daily temperature (minimum and maximum), relative humidity (minimum and maximum) and rainfall (mm). Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed six significant correlations between climatic factor and disease incidence; five of them referred to relative humidity. Data indicate that disease incidence during summer is the result of the interaction among foregoing climatic events, which affect early phases of the pathogen's biological cycle, and climatic factors that directly affect the pathogen's structures present at the time of the disease onset.
