23187389|Timonius subgenus Timonius consists of eight species of trees and shrubs distributed throughout southeastern Malesia and tropical Australia. The subgenus appears to be monophyletic, all member species having valvate-calyptrate stipules and numerous ovules arranged around an elongate, pendulous placenta. A cladistic analysis shows that T. timon and its closest relatives from an unresolved polytomy and share advanced characters of calyx morphology as well as foliar domatioid nectaries. Keys are provided to all taxa. Three new combinations (Timonius timon var. grandiflorus, T. timon var. whiteanus, and T. tomentosus) are made; two new varieties (T. timon var. buloloensis and T. timon var. reticulatus) and one new species (T. lageniferus) are described.
