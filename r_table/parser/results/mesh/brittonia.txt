2806512|Potentilla basaltica Tiehm & Ertter is described, illustrated, and compared to other members of the Multijugae group, P. newberryi, and Ivesia. The leaf form and small flowers are reminiscent of Ivesia, indicating a possible new link between the two genera.
4098999| A new palm species, Coccothrinax torrida, endemic to a karst hill of semidesert southeastern Cuba, is described and illustrated. The new species is small sized, related to C. pauciramosa, and is characterized by the following features: narrow semiorbicular flat leaves that are covered on the adaxial surface by white wax; a small irregular palman; long and erect inflorescences; and small, white, smooth fruits. /// Se describe una nueva especie de palmera, Coccothrinax torrida, endmica de una montaa krstica en la zona semidesrtica en el Sudeste de Cuba. El nuevo taxn es de tamao pequeo, es cercano a C. pauciramosa, y se caracteriza por tener hojas semiorbiculares estrechas y planas cubiertas de cera blanca en la cara adaxial, con un palman irregular y pequeo, inflorescencias largas y erectas y frutos pequeos, blancos y lisos. 
4497371|Malaxis molotensis, a new orchid species from a wet cloud forest of the Sierra Madre del Sur, Guerrero, Mexico is described and illustrated. In habit and floral structure it resembles the widespread M. histionantha but differs in the elliptic labellum with incurved distal margin, and elongate, oblong-falciform pollinaria.
2807176|Sullivantia (Saxifragaceae) is restricted to the United States; its species occur in very specialized habitats such as wet cliffs and moist canyon walls in scattered localities from Washington and Oregon, eastward to Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, and Virginia. Relationships in the genus were reevaluated using data from morphology (including the use of greenhouse-grown plants), crossability, and flavonoid chemistry. The conclusion of this study is that Sullivantia comprises four morphologically similar allopatric taxa: S. oregana, S. hapemanii var. hapemanii, S. hapemannii var. purpusii, and S. sullivantii.
2806426|Lecythis barnebyi Mori and Corythophora amapaensis Pires ex Mori & Prance are described and the following new combinations are coined: Lecythis brancoensis (R. Knuth) Mori, L. schwackei (R. Knuth) Mori, L. alutacea (A. C. Smith) Mori, L. lurida (Miers) Mori, L. holcogyne (Sandwith) Mori, L. corrugata Poiteau subsp. rosea (Spruce ex Berg) Mori, and Corythophora labriculata (Eyma) Mori & Prance.
2806365|A montane population of Trillium pusilum Michx. from the crest of Shenandoah Mountain on the Virginia-West Virginia state line is newly described as T. pusillum var. monticulum. It differs from the related coastal plain variant, var. virginianum Fernald, by its broader and shorter leaf and sepal ratios, typically notched petal apices, consistently sessile flowers (not at all pedicellate), slightly shorter style, and reduced stature. The var. monticulum is restricted to the ridge crest of the mountains at 1190 m (3900 ft) elevation while the var. virginianum is restricted to the coastal plains of eastern Maryland and Virginia at elevations less than 30 m (100 ft).
2807773|A new species of Sorghastrum, S. pohlianum, from Mexico is described and illustrated. A numerical analysis comparing the new species to the closest species (S. nutans and S. nudipes) was undertaken. The first three principal components explain 84% of the variation of the taxa involved. In addition there is morphological evidence to distinguish the new species from its closest relatives. It differs from S. nutans by showing smaller inflorescences, having sterile lemmas and anthers, and having somewhat smaller but wider blades and different flowering periods. In addition, it is distinguished from S. nudipes due to the presence of auricles > 1 mm long and inflorescence branches bearing spikelets along their entire length.
2806308|The reproductive biology of Goodyera oblongifolia, G. repens var. ophioides and G. tesselata is discussed with emphasis on the reproductive isolating mechanisms operating in mixed-species populations. Cytology, phenology and pollination of the above three species were studied. artificial hybridizations were made of these three species and of G. pubescens. Results show that within mixed-species populations, G. oblongifolia, G. repens var. ophioides and G. tesselata are not completely isolated reproductively, and hybridization does occur. The deleterious effects of the loss of gametes to interspecific crosses are reduced by seasonal isolation, perennial growth and geitonogamous seed production which is encouraged by self-compatibility and clonal growth. Thus, hybridization in mixed-species populations is apparently kept to levels low enough to allow the species to maintain their identities.
2805647|Chromosome counts are presented for 43 collections of Nigerian grasses representing 39 species and 25 genera.
2806401|Twelve taxa are recognized in section Gormania, a group geographically restricted to western North America. A discussion of the features and relationships of the taxa, a key to and descriptions of the taxa are presented.
2806704|A new species from Wyoming, Penstemon gibbensii, is described and contrasted to related species.
40792894|The tree genus Holocalyx (Leguminosae, Papilionoideae) is distributed in southern South America and inhabits moist forests or gallery forests of the Cerrado. It is poorly studied taxonomically in spite of its economic importance as material for tool handles, rustic furniture, and fuel wood. Holocalyx is characterized by flowers with a nearly truncate calyx, an actinomorphic corolla of five petals, an androecium of ten stamens, and a stipitate gynoecium positioned centrally within the flower. There are two binomials in the genus: Holocalyx balansae and H. glaziovii. The first one was introduced with the description of the genus, but type material was not specified for the species. The latter, despite being a nomen nudum, is relatively widely applied in herbarium identifications. In this paper, we evaluate nomenclature within Holocalyx and present a taxonomic revision of the genus. We conclude that Holocalyx is monotypic, containing the single species H. balansae.
2806514|Piptadenia (sect. Pityrocarpa) leucoxylon is described from the lower Orinoco basin in Venezuela, and Pithecellobium (sect. Samanea) foederale from Distrito Federal, Brazil, Figures, diagnoses, and discussion of kinship are presented for each.
3218473| Stenocereus zopilotensis Arreola-Nava and Terrazas, a new species from the Zopilote Canyon, municipality of Zumpango del Rio in the center of the state of Guerrero (Mexico), is described and illustrated. This new species is compared to Stenocereus quevedonis J. G. Ortega, S. fricii Snchez-Mej., and S. pruinosus (Otto) Buxb. based on morphological similarity. Moreover, the new species grows sympatrically with S. pruinosus. /// [Spanish]Se describe e ilustra Stenocereus zopilotensis Arreola-Nava y Terrazas procedente de la Caada del Zopilote en el municipio de Zumpango del Ro en el centro del estado de Guerrero (Mexico). Se le compara con Stenocereus quevedonis J. G. Ortega, S. fricii Snchez-Mej. y S. pruinosus (Otto) Buxb. que parecen ser las especies ms parecidas morfolgicamente. Adems la nueva especie crece simptricamente con S. pruinosus. 
2806598|Enzyme electrophoresis was employed to examine genetic variation within and among the three diploid (n=12) species comprising Coreopsis section Calliopsis: C. leavenworthii, C. paludosa and C. tinctoria. Twelve enzymes specified by 20 genes were included, and those isozymes localized in the plastids were identified for several of the enzymes. Mean genetic indentities calculated for pair-wise comparisons of 22 populations (four of C. leavenworthii, one for C. paludosa, and 17 of C. tinctoria) reveal no genetic differentiation between C. leavenworthii and C. tinctoria, whereas C. paludosa exhibits lowered values with the other two taxa. These results are in general agreement with concepts of relationships inferred from morphological and biosystematic data. That is, C. paludosa has been viewed as more distinct from C. leavenworthii and C. tinctoria that the latter two are from each other. The high similarity between. C. leavenworthii and C. tinctoria is somewhat unexpected, however, given the several morphological features that serve consistently to distinguish them.
4098958|Elaphoglossum gemmatum, a species of proliferous fern from Colombia, is described, illustrated, and compared to the most similar species, E. exsertipes, E. phyllitidis, and E. proliferans.
2666507|Phenology, inflorescence behavior, and pollination of 10 sympatric taxa of Bactris were studied in a lowland Amazon forest. Taxa flowered over an eight month period during the rainy season and early dry season, but individual taxa flowered for one to a few months. Related taxa had mostly non-overlapping flowering periods. Inflorescence behavior was similar for all taxa, with nocturnal pistillate anthesis and temperature elevation, followed 24 hours later by rapid, nocturnal staminate anthesis. Pollinators of all taxa were small weevils Phyllotrox (Curculionidae) and nitidulids Colopterus (Nitidulidae), although various other insect visitors were recorded. Large numbers of Phyllotrox were recorded on inflorescences, but weevil sex ratios were highly skewed.
2807324|Bartholomaea has remained of uncertain tribal affinities within Flacourtiaceae since its description, having been allied by various authors with the tribes Casearieae or Scolopieae. However scanning electron microscope examination of floral morphology has uncovered characters that indicate a relationship with Neopringlea and Trimeria of tribe Homalieae.
2806908|Peltogyne chrysopis, an emergent tree of Bahian Atlantic Forest notable for subsessile, globose flowers with rudimentary solid hypanthium, densely white-velutinous sepals and ovary, and planocompressed, elliptic-suborbicular fruits narrowly winged along the short seminiferous suture, is described and figured. A key to species of Peltogyne known from the state of Bahia is provided.
2807200|A new combination, Glandularia x hybrida, and a lectotype are proposed for the common Garden Vervain (Verbena x hybrida). The plant is of horticultural origin, but occurs widely in North America and Mexico as an adventive.
2805563|Six hundred seeds belonging to the genus Mentzelia (Loasaceae) were examined using the Scanning Electron Microscope. The Seeds represented all six sections of the genus and approximately 76% of the total number of species from northern Mexico and western United States. Emphasis was placed on seed material from Wyoming and adjoining states. Ovule serial sectioning was done to deternine testa ontogeny. In all cases seed surface structures could be related to excreascences developing from the integument cells. Six basic seed coat relief features could be distinguished, corresponding to the six sections in the genus. Minor variations in the basic types are constant and characteristic for species or, in very few instances, for species groups. A dendrogram was constructed from the seed testa data which supports the phylogeny established from chromosomal and morphological data. Practical application of seed coat microcharacter specificity to identification of Mentzelia seeds from prehistoric sites is suggested.
2666512|As a result of examining specimens of Dilleniaceae for the Flora of Ecuador and Flora Neotropica, a new species (Doliocarpus subandinus) from Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia is described and illustrated, and the relationship with allied species is discussed.
4497363|A new hybrid, Micropolypodium xbradei, from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is described and illustrated. It shows intermediate morphology between its parents, M. setosum and Terpsichore achilleifolia, in dissection of blades and veins, and number of sori per segment. New combinations for Brazilian endemic species are presented based on this hybrid and on recent results in grammitid phylogenetics.
2806500|Eobruchia ecuatoriana sp. nov. (Bruchiaceae) has the aspect of a diminutive Trematodon, but is distinctive in having a mitrate calyptra and flexuous seta; Macromitrium perreflexum sp. nov. (Orthotrichaceae) has remarkably reflexed leaves, unlike any known species; Lepidopilum pulcherrimum sp. nov. (Hookeriaceae) is distinguished by its large size and beautifully undulate leaves; Symphyodon americanus sp. nov. (Symphyodontaceae) is remarkable in being the first American representative of a genus and family previously known only fro Asia; it is most closely related to S. echinatus (Mitt.) Jaeg. of the Himalayas and Thailand.
2806135|The closely related fern genera Hemionitis L. and Gymnopteris Bernhardi are separated primarily on differences in leaf architecture and venation. Studies indicate that these characters are highly variable and unreliably diagnostic. Further, the type species of the two genera readily hybridize with each other. Spore morphology, as exhibited by SEM, does not support the traditional alignment of the species in these two genera: some species of hemionitis and Gymnopteris have the same rugose to papillate spores, while other species from both genera possess crested spores. The flavonoid chemistry of these taxa coinciedes with spore type, i.e., taxa from both genera which possess crested spores produce kaempferol and quercetin 3-0-glycosides, while species with tuberculate spores produce only quercetin 3,4 -0-glycosides. The spore and chemical data suggest a realignment of these taxa within a single genus, which would avoid the rather tenuous dependence on a single vegetative character for generic distinctions.
3218427| In a survey of the genus Hybanthus in Brazil, it was found that Ionidium nanum A. St.-Hil. should be considered distinct from Hybanthus albus (A. St.-Hil.) Baill., based on characteristics of indument, habit and nectariferous appendages, and also habitat and geographical distribution. A new combination of I. nanum within Hybanthus is therefore proposed.posed. [Spanish]Durante o levantamento das espcies de Hybanthus no Brasil, observou-se que Ionidium nanum A. St.-Hil. Baill., deveria ser considerado como uma espcie distinta de Hybanthus albus (A. St.-Hil.) Baill., baseado em caractersticas do indumento, hbito e dos apndices nectarferos,alm de hbitat e distribuio geogrfica; desta forma, a nova combinao de I.nanum em Hybanthus  proposta. 
4098953| This study represents a nuclear rDNA ITS-based phylogenetic analyses of a greater sampling of the Old World Astragalus compared to our previous work (212 vs. 134 taxa). Phylogenetic relationships among 212 species (213 accessions) of the Old World Astragalus, including newly segregated monotypic genus Podlechiella, the two aneuploid New World Astragalus, and five related genera, were inferred from analyses of nuclear rDNA ITS sequences using maximum parsimony. A total of 658 nucleotide sites and four binary characters for indels were analyzed. The results of phylogenetic analyses suggest sect. Phyllolobium, comprising mostly the Chinese species, is placed outside of the so-called Astragalus s. str. and is a well-supported monophyletic group. The monotypic annual segregate genus Thlaspidium (Astragalus sect. Thlaspidium, A. thlaspi), is clearly nested within Astragalus s. str. Among the many sections analyzed here, only sects. Cenanthrum, Caraganella, Eremophysa, Incani, Laxiflori, and Lotidium are strongly supported as monophyletic. Our analysis, in agreement with previous studies, shows that the North American euploid Astragalus species are scattered throughout the Old World groups of the genus. 
2806877|H. P. Sartwell's private herbarium was donated to the New York Botanical Garden in 1983 by Hamilton College of Clinton, New York. This herbarium was assembled by Dr. Sartwell (1792-1867) through-out his career and was eventually sold to Hamilton College. The collection is particularly rich in type material, western New York plants, and carices. Dr. Sartwell had an active exchange program with his contemporaries and, therefore, his herbarium also has collections from many parts of the world. An index to collectors is presented, as well as a list of verified and probable types.
2807665|Comparison of midribs of three cycad genera, Chigua, Cycas, and Stangeria, the only three genera characterized by midribs in the pinnae, show that those of Chigua and Stangeria are very similar to each other and quite unlike those of Cycas. Midribs of Cycas include a single, median vein, and the pinnae of these species lack lateral veins. Pinnae midribs of Chigua and Stangeria include several (2-5 and 2-8, respectively) longitudinal parallel veins, and dichotomizing lateral veins arising from the midrib. Pinnae of other cycads including Zamia, with which Chigua appears to be most closely allied, exhibit evenly spaced, longitudinally parallel, dichotomizing veins, a character considered to be primitive. All veins in cycad leaves have a single mesarch protoxylem pole. The midrid condition in Chigua and Stangeria represents an advanced state in comparison to that in the leaf of the Marattiales, for example, where there is a single veined midrib but with numerous mesearch protoxylem poles. It would appear that the midrid has been derived independently at least three times within the cycads, once in each major group.
2807743|From the Patagonian region in Argentina Astragalus neocarpus is described and illustrated. The false septum of its fruit is formed by union of the seed-funicles with the endocarp.
2806726|A new species, Trillium parviflorum, is described in Trillium subgen. Phyllantherum Raf. Trillium parviflorum is easily distinguished from T. albidum Freeman, which it superficially resembles, by its overall smaller size, much smaller linear-lanceolate petals, clove-like fragrance, and dark maroon fruit.
2805930|A New genus, Correllia, and its single species, C. montana, are described from Sierra Mohinora in southwestern Chihuahua, Mexico. The genus belongs in subtribe Peritylinae (Compositae tribe Helenieae) and appears to be most closely related to Perityle.

2806048|Miconia centrosperma and M. santaritensis from Panama, and M. stevensiana from Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, are described, illustrated, and compared with their presumed relatives.
2805907|Six species are recognized, one of which, Tabebuia neochrysantha, is described as new. The species are delimited primarily on the basis of herbarium material, supplemented by field observation. A key is included, as well as distribution maps, and morphological, anatomical, and ecological data for each species.
2807586|Described from Angasima-tepui in Edo. Bolvar, Venezuela is a new species of Stomatochaeta, a generic segregate of Stenopadus. The distinctions between these two genera are briefly discussed and a key to the new species, Stomatochaeta acuminata, and the other species of Stomatochaeta is given. Bilabiate flowers are reported for the first time in Glossarion, which formerly was thought to have only ligulate flowers. Guaicaia, erected to house a single species with bilabiate flowers but otherwise similar in critical features to the reportedly ligulate Glossarion, is reduced to synonymy. Accordingly, the new combination Glossarion bilabiatum is proposed. An emended generic description of Glossarion and a key to its species are presented.
2805467|The genus Moonia of India and Ceylon, traditionally placed in the subtribe Melampodiinae, is shown to have closer affinities with Dahlia and Hidalgoa of the subtribe Coreopsidinae. Several morphologically heterogeneous taxa are excluded from Moonia, and the remaining species, M. heterophylla, is described and illustrated.
2807400| Croton chamelensis Lott, known from the Estacin de Biologa, Chamela, Jalisco, and surrounding area, is described and illustrated. It appears to be most closely related to C. ramillatus Croizat of Veracruz. 
2807846|An analysis of the flowering plant flora of a lowland moist forest in central French Guiana reveals 25 species with adaptations for epizoochorous dispersal by barbs, hooks, or spines (stick-tights). This represents 1.5% of the flowering plant flora. Stick-tights are represented among the monocotyledons of the flora of central French Guiana by five species of Poaceae. The Fabaceae and Asteraceae, each with six species with stick-tight dispersal, are richest families of flowering plants in terms of stick-tight dispersal in central French Guiana. This region possesses numerous potential mammal and bird dispersal agents, therefore it is a puzzle why stick-tight dispersal, especially among species of the canopy, is not more frequent.
