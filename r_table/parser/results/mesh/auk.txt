4087027|We used electronic activity recorders to measure flight time, dive time, and time on the water of breeding Common Murres (Uria aalge). During both incubation and chick rearing, about 90% of birds' time away from the colony was spent on the water or diving and 10% was spent flying. The proportion of flight time did not vary with trip duration. During chick rearing, 13.6% of time away from the colony was spent diving, and the proportion of time spent diving tended to decrease with trip duration. Potential foraging ranges calculated from flight times during individual foraging trips showed a concave frequency distribution, and median potential ranges were 37.8 km for incubating birds and 5.4 km for chick-rearing birds. The use of electronic recorders to measure time budgets has broad applications for seabird energetics and foraging ecology and for the assessment of prey availability and abundance.
4086119|We examine the predictions, based upon the hypotheses of Coulson (1968), Hamilton (1971), and Vine (1971), that (1) species whose colonies are accessible to predators should form tighter groupings and have fewer isolated nests than those with reduced accessibility to predators, (2) nests at the center should be less subject to predation than those at the edge of a colony, (3) nests both in the center and with reduced accessibility should have the lowest predation pressure of all nests, and (4) individuals that nest in accessible locations should have more vigorous and more sustained antipredator behaviors than those individuals unlikely to come frequently in contact with predators. To test these predictions, we compare intrusions by two predators, the Northwestern Crow (Corvus caurinus) and the Glaucous-winged Gull (Larus glaucescens), at isolated and grouped nests of the cliff-face nesting Pelagic Cormorant (Phalacrocorax pelagicus) and cliff-top nesting Double-crested Cormorant (P. auritus) on Mandarte Island, British Columbia. Both crows and gulls preferred to visit the edge nests of both species, especially those on level ground. The steeper and more central the nest location, the less likely was visitation. Gulls were restricted by topography from entering the Pelagic colony, while crows were able to land in either colony. Predator success was high only in flat, accessible areas. Both cormorant species depend upon the habitat to deter predator access: the Double-crested Cormorant utilizes a defense regime of energetic and aggressive behaviors; the Pelagic Cormorant uses a much less effective defense and depends much more on the habitat as a necessary part of nest defense.

10.2307/4086892|We studied the distribution, population size, and habitat response of the Palila (Loxioides bailleui) during the 1980-1984 nonbreeding seasons to infer factors that limit the population and to develop management strategies. Distribution was fairly constant from year to year. Palila were confined to the subalpine woodland on Mauna Kea on the island of Hawaii, occurred between 2,000 and 2,850 m elevation, and reached highest densities on the southwest slopes. The population showed large annual fluctuations, from 6,400 birds in 1981 to 2,000 in 1984. The width of woodland was the most important variable in determining habitat response. Palila were more common in areas with greater crown cover, taller trees, and a higher proportion of native plants in the understory. Annual variation in Palila density within a habitat reflected variation in levels of their staple food, mamane pods. The main limiting factors of the population appeared to be the availability of good habitat and levels of their staple food. Palila had strongly depressed densities in the Pohakuloa flats area. This low density could not be explained by gross habitat features or food levels. Site tenacity, thermal stress, disturbance, and disease were hypothesized explanations. Our study indicated that the most effective management strategies would be the removal of feral ungulates and certain noxious plants from Palila habitat and the extension of the woodland zone to areas now intensively grazed.
10.1525/auk.2011.11095|In lek mating systems, females visit aggregations of displaying males and appear to have unrestricted opportunity to choose and mate with any male. Behavioral observations of lekking birds indicate that females generally mate once and that only a small percentage of males gain a majority of copulations. However, genetic analyses of paternity have revealed that multiple males sometimes sire young within one brood. We analyzed paternity of 25 broods of Greater Prairie-Chickens (
4087716|I studied migratory flocks of finches (Fringilla coelebs and F. montifringilla) feeding during three autumn and two spring seasons at a stopover site in South Sweden. Raptors attacked flocks repeatedly, and the finches showed obvious adaptations to the risk. A total of 304 attacks were recorded, of which 270 were from European Sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus). Attack frequency was significantly higher in autumn (1.9 attacks/h) than in spring (0.3 attacks/h). In autumn, finch flock size varied from 10 to 10,000. Both attack frequency and hunting success increased with flock size. The risk for an individual finch to be killed (successful attacks per hour and individual) showed no correlation with flock size. Thus predation seemed not to be the primary cause for formation of large finch flocks. Instead, patchy distribution of the preferred food presumably causes large numbers of finches to aggregate. Once aggregated at a field, the best antipredator strategy for the finches is probably to crowd into a dense flock with synchronized feeding. I estimated that ca. 10% of the finches were killed by raptors during the autumn migration.
10.2307/4090309| The relationship between health and demography in the Green-rumped Parrotlet (Forpus passerinus) was examined, using hematological measurements as indicators of health. Variation in adult hematology with gender, age, time during nesting cycle, and breeding status were examined. Only gender and time during nesting cycle showed significant effects on hematology. Females had higher white-blood-cell counts and immunoglobulin-G (IgG) levels than males. Hematocrit was lower during egg laying than at other stages for females, whereas white-blood-cell counts and IgG and alpha-2-macroglobulin
4088237|We studied the prevalence of the blood parasite Haemoproteus prognei (Haematoprotozoa) from 1986 to 1990 in a breeding colony of Purple Martins (Progne subis) in Maryland and in overwintering martins in three Brazilian roosts in 1990. Yearling breeders were infected at a significantly lower rate than adults, and no yearlings in wintering roosts were infected. Haemoproteus prognei might be more virulent in immunologically naive birds and cause high mortality in young birds during the stress of their first migration. Many birds became infested over three years and most maintained a chronic infection. Infected birds returned to the colony with the same frequency as uninfected birds. Infected adults tended to arrive at the breeding site ahead of uninfected adults. Clutch size did not differ, but uninfected females had lower breeding success than infected individuals. We discuss the evolutionary implications of high mortality coupled with superior breeding success in chronically infected birds, whose immune system has been "tested" for parasite resistance, and suggest an alternative to the predominant view that parasite resistance means avoiding them altogether.
10.2307/4088946|In 1992 and 1993, 28 Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) broods in north-central New Mexico were used in a supplemental-feeding experiment to determine if there was a causal relationship between food availability and survival of young goshawks. We randomly assigned 28 nests as treatments or controls. Every two days (from hatching [late April] until juvenile dispersal [mid-October]) we visited control nest stands and provided food at treatment nest stands. We measured morphological characteristics and attached tarsal-mounted transmitters with mortality switches to 42 nestling Northern Goshawks when they were 21 days old. In both 1992 and 1993, we relocated birds via telemetry every other day until mid-August. We located birds at least once a week from mid-August until mid-October in 1992, and until late-November 1993. There were no significant differences in nestling size. Treatment birds had a significantly higher survival rate during the nestling period in 1993, but not in 1992. Because most control nestlings died from predation, we attribute higher nestling survival to increased time spent in nest stands by adult females, whose presence probably deterred predators.
4086423|I studied pairing chronology and agonistic displays of Gadwalls (Anas strepera) and spatial associations among Gadwalls and other Anatinae in the coastal marshes of southwestern Louisiana from October 1977 through April 1978. Gadwalls began arriving in Louisiana in late September, but by mid-October 45% of females were paired and by late November 81% were paired. The percentage of paired females increased slowly to 90% in April. Bill threats were the predominant agonistic display of Gadwalls, accounting for 89% of all observations, while chasing (5.8%) and biting (5.2%) accounted for the remainder. Nearly all (91.1%) conflicts involved birds that had been feeding before the dispute. On average, Gadwalls spent 0.4% of their time in agonistic activities. Gadwalls preferred to associate with individuals of similar pair status. Paired Gadwalls were more likely to threaten other paired birds, and unpaired Gadwalls other unpaired birds, than they would individuals of the other pair status. Only 14% of disputes involving Gadwalls were with other Anatinae. Pairs were considered dominant over unpaired birds, as pairs won 81% (P < 0.001) of contests with unpaired birds. This study suggested that paired birds, because of their dominance, probably had greater access to preferred food resources and were more successful in meeting nutrient requirements than were unpaired birds. It also suggested that pairing chronology in Anatinae may be related to food choice and foraging strategies, those species feeding on poorer-quality foods forming pairs earlier, as individuals attempt to optimize their allocation of time for feeding and other activities.
4086523| A color-banded population of Spotted Sandpipers (Actitis macularia) was studied over a 10-yr period on Little Pelican Island, Leech Lake, Minnesota. A total of 75 females and 107 males bred for 144   yr and 200   yr. The observed skew in the population sex ratio was due primarily to behavioral exclusion of inexperienced females. Density appeared to limit population size and productivity. Locally hatched chicks accounted for 31% and 40% of the breeding females in the final 2 yr. Females laid eggs for 1.35-2.06 males per year. Experienced females had significantly more mates, eggs, chicks, and fledglings than did inexperienced females. Locally hatched chicks accounted for 21% and 19% of the breeding males in the final 2 yr. Males mated with 1.0-1.4 females per year. Experienced males had more mates and received more replacement eggs than did inexperienced males; in contrast to females, however, inexperienced males had no less hatching or fledging success than did experienced males. Thirty-eight marked females and 16 marked males tried unsuccessfully to enter the population, and 6 females and no males were observed to be nonbreeders all season long. Of 1,142 eggs, 442 hatched and 256 fledged. Experienced birds returned to breed more often in subsequent years than did inexperienced ones (61% vs. 50%). Return rates of successful birds were consistently higher than those of unsuccessful birds, the difference decreasing with age. Young males appeared to be less site-faithful than were females and older males. Successfully breeding females lived an average of 3.7 yr. Relative to other scolopacids with multipurpose territories, the Spotted Sandpiper is considered a pioneering species that quickly and frequently colonizes new sites, emigrates in response to reproductive failure, breeds first at an early age, lives a relatively short time, lays many eggs per female per year, and has relatively low nest success. 
4089548|Pigeon Guillemots (Cepphus columba) are diving seabirds that forage near shore and feed their chicks demersal and schooling fishes. During nine years between 1979 and 1997, we studied chick diet, chick growth rate, and reproductive success of Pigeon Guillemots at Prince William Sound, Alaska, to determine factors limiting breeding populations. We found evidence for prey specialization among breeding pairs and detected differences in reproductive success between specialists and generalists. Pairs that specialized on particular prey types when foraging for their chicks fledged more chicks than those that generalized, apparently because they delivered larger individual prey items. Reproductive performance also varied among guillemot pairs as a function of the proportion of high-lipid schooling fishes fed to the chicks. Pairs that delivered primarily high-lipid fishes (Pacific sand lance [Ammodytes hexapterus] and Pacific herring [Clupea pallasii]) had higher overall reproductive success than pairs that delivered primarily low-lipid demersal fishes (e.g. sculpins, blennies, stichaeids, and pholidids) and gadids. The proportion of high-lipid fishes in the diet was positively related to chick growth, suggesting that piscivorous seabird chicks benefit from eating species with high-energy densities during development. The diet of Pigeon Guillemot chicks showed high annual variation from 1979 to 1997, presumably because of fluctuations in abundance of Pacific sand lance, a high-lipid schooling fish. Regression analyses suggest that the percent occurrence of high-lipid fishes in the diet affected chick growth rate at the population level. We conclude that Pigeon Guillemots benefit by specializing when selecting prey for their chicks, and that high-lipid schooling fishes enhance chick growth and reproductive success.
10.2307/4088722|Brood parasites and nest predators reduce the seasonal fecundity and, hence, the population growth rates of their victims. However, most field studies do not measure directly how parasites and predators decrease seasonal fecundity, but instead measure the impact of these organisms on individual nesting attempts. Because a female may renest after losing a nest to predation, abandoning a parasitized nest, or successfully fledging a brood, knowing how brood parasites and nest predators reduce the number of offspring fledged from individual nesting attempts is not equivalent to knowing their impact on seasonal fecundity. We address this problem by developing a mathematical model that: estimates several parameters describing the natural history of this system, including the brood-parasitism rate, nest-predation rate, and probability of nest abandonment in response to a parasitism event; and extrapolates to seasonal fecundity from these parameters and others describing the length of the breeding season, the timing of events in the nesting cycle, and the productivity of parasitized and unparasitized nests. We also show how different researchers using different observational methodologies to study exactly the same population likely would arrive at noticeably different conclusions regarding the intensity of brood parasitism, and we provide mathematical formulas for comparing among several of these measures of parasitism. Our procedures extend Mayfield's method for calculating nest-success rates from nest-history data in that we simultaneously estimate parameters describing nest predation and brood parasitism, predict seasonal fecundity from these parameters, and provide confidence intervals on all parameter estimates. The model should make the design and interpretation of logistically difficult empirical studies more efficient. It also can be specialized to species affected by nest predators but not brood parasites. We use the model to analyze Prairie Warbler (Dendroica discolor) and Black-capped Vireo (Vireo atricapillus) nesting data. We estimate the model's parameters for these species and use the resulting estimates to predict seasonal fecundity. For both species, the predicted seasonal fecundity closely matches the value measured directly.
10.2307/25150212|The importance of the black facial pattern in sexual selection in Golden-winged Warblers (Vermivora chrysoptera) was evaluated through experimental plumage modification. We lightened the throat patch and eye mask with hair bleach, which essentially created artificial Brewster's Warbler (F1 generation of Golden-winged Warbler  Blue-winged Warbler [V. pinus]) plumage phenotypes. Experimental males lost their original territories and failed to obtain mates. We concluded that there is sexual selection against the Brewster's facial pattern. Sexual selection attributable to the face pattern may explain the apparent greater effect of hybridization on Golden-winged Warblers than on Blue-winged Warblers. /// La importancia del patrn facial en la seleccin sexual de Vermivora chrysoptera fue evaluada mediante un experimento de modificacin del plumaje. El parche gular y el antifaz fueron decolorados con aclarador de pelo, creando as fenotipos artificiales de hbridos F1 V. chrysoptera  V. pinus. Los machos decolorados perdieron sus territorios originales y no consiguieron pareja. Concluimos que existe seleccin en contra de los fenotipos faciales hbridos. La seleccin sexual atribuible al patrn facial puede explicar el aparente mayor efecto de la hibridacin en V. chrysoptera que en V. pinus.
4087385|We examined fish dynamics within the temporal framework of the reproductive cycle of Common Terns from 1982-1985. The hypothesis that the breeding season of terns is timed to overlap with a seasonal increase in food abundance was supported by the data. Prey fish were more available during breeding than postfledging. However, the further hypothesis that the timing of tern breeding is adapted to exploit peak prey availability while feeding growing chicks was not generally supported over the course of the study. Food for terns peaked and began to decline before the period of peak demand of food by chicks.

4087673|We compared a number of univariate and multivariate measures of body size used commonly in ornithological research, including eight multivariate measures (from principal components analyses), plus skull length, ulna length, tibiotarsus length, wing length, and weight. Analyses are based on 26 measurements on three randomly selected male and three randomly selected female Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis) from each of 53 different geographic localities throughout the species' range. Six of the eight principal components analyses provided essentially the same information about body size. Analyses based on the variance-covariance matrix of raw or log-transformed data provided first axes that varied most from the other multivariate estimates of size. Among the univariate measures, ulna length, wing length, and body weight contributed information that diverged from the multivariate measures of overall size. Weight better represents general size (i.e. PC I) than wing length, but because of variation in reproductive condition, weight is a far better measure in males than in females. Wing length is not a representative measure of body size. Inasmuch as each principal components analysis provides information about body size on PC I, we encourage researchers to choose among the various approaches according to analytical objectives rather than methodological simplicity or general utility.
25488600|As a result of changes in climate over the past 100 years, many birds are arriving at points along their migration routes earlier in the spring now than they did in the past. Increasingly, researchers are relying on a variety of data sources, such as naturalist journals and bird-club records, to document migration times. However, it is not clear whether researchers can successfully use different sources of data to compare changes in migration times. We examined 25 years of changes in migration times for 30 species of birds at Mt. Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as documented by bird-club members and published in a regional bird journal. We found that, overall, birds arrived earlier in warmer springs in eastern Massachusetts. We compared our findings with those of previous studies in Massachusetts, which included data from a standardized bird-banding station and observations from a naturalist's journal and bird-club records. On a species-by-species basis, changes in migration times were not correlated among the studies. We believe that local changes in population sizes and sampling effort at some of the sites may have contributed to the lack of correlation. For the purpose of comparing changes in migration times across species and locations, standardized bird-banding data are preferable to data collected by volunteer naturalists. However, naturalist data sources are useful and reflect the widely observed trend toward earlier migrations in warm springs.
4086466|Cymbilaimus sanctaemariae (Formicariidae), previously regarded as a poorly known subspecies of C. lineatus, is a distinct species. The two forms overlap broadly in geographical range and are distinct in morphology, plumage, voice, and habitat. We propose the vernacular name Bamboo Antshrike. The species apparently links Cymbilaimus and Thamnophilus. It is a member of the growing list of bamboo-associated birds endemic to southwestern Amazonia.
10.2307/4089807|We provide the first comprehensive description of a bird community from a lowland rainforest site on a major island in the Solomon Islands. During two dry season visits (July 1997, June 1998) to the lower Garanga River valley on the island of Isabel, we recorded 65 resident and 6 migrant species of birds. We document relative abundances, habitat preferences, and foraging guilds for the members of the bird community. The Garanga River site sustains all but 11 of the 76 species of landbirds known from Isabel. Of those 11 species, four are small-island or beach specialists, three are montane, and four are of unknown status. Habitat heterogeneity, maintained largely by river dynamics, is a major contributor to avian diversity at the site. The avifauna is dominated by nonpasserines, especially parrots, pigeons, kingfishers, and hawks. The flightless rail Nesoclopeus woodfordi, previously regarded as rare and threatened with extinction, was common. We recorded Ixobrychus flavicollis, Falco severus, and Eudynamys scolopacea for the first time on Isabel. We also documented occurrence in the lowlands of Micropsitta finschii, Collocalia spodiopygia, Coracina caledonica, and Pachycephala pectoralis, four species previously thought to be confined to upper elevations on Isabel. The depauperate understory avifauna of the Garanga River site may be anthropogenic and could belie what otherwise seems to be an intact avifauna.

10.2307/4088934|Parrots are known for their capacity to reproduce the sounds of human speech, but few studies have investigated their mechanisms for producing such vocalizations. Using three methods of noninvasive video imaging (Super VHS video, infrared, X-ray radiography), we examined correlations between several elements of a Grey Parrot's (Psittacus erithacus) vocal-tract configuration and the bird's production of two vowels, /i/ ("eat") and /a/ ("rock"). This parrot uses mechanisms that both resemble and differ from those used by: (a) humans to produce English speech; and (b) some avian species to produce conspecific vocalizations. This Grey Parrot, for example, uses its vocal apparatus in some but not all of the ways used by humans to produce vowels. Although our Grey Parrot, like some oscines, appears to use beak opening to modify the characteristics of sound, the specific sound-modification properties of beak opening may or may not be similar to those of nonpsittacids. We describe a first-order model that, although simplistic, may aid our understanding of the mechanisms that enable a parrot to reproduce human speech.
10.2307/4088145|A new method of measuring reproductive success is proposed that uses a composite of breeding-behavior observations (for behaviors that reflect different stages in the reproductive cycle) as an index of fitness. This reproductive index does not rely on discovery of nests, but is comprehensive in that it includes information on all monitored territories. The reproductive index was applied to three co-occurring grassland emberizine sparrows, two of which required special care because of their regional rarity. Ranks derived from this reproductive index were used to distinguish territories of birds of known high success (i.e. those that fledged young in at least one brood) from territories of birds with known low success (unpaired males), and were compared with findings for "spot-mapped" territories. Principal-components analyses of habitat measurements for these territory types revealed a similar pattern for all three species: spot-mapped territories overlapped broadly with nonterritory (unoccupied) plots, whereas high-success territories formed a discrete, isolated cluster within the spot-map matrix. Univariate analyses revealed that high-success territories were described by 15 vegetation features that differed (P < 0.01) from nonterritory values, whereas in spot-mapped territories only 8 vegetation measures differed and in low-success territories only 2 differed. The ability to distinguish high-success territories allowed us to identify a greater number of habitat features that were correlated with reproductive success. If we had relied on the spot-mapping method, we would have been unable to identify many of these important habitat features. Yet, the ability to make such discriminations is likely to be critical in the management of threatened species.
4086963|The Shiny Cowbird (Molothrus bonariensis) of South America, Panama, and the West Indies is an obligate brood parasite known to have used 176 species of birds as hosts. This study documents wide variability in the quality of real and potential hosts in terms of response to eggs, nestling diet, and nest survivorship. The eggs of the parasite are either spotted or immaculate in eastern Argentina and neighboring parts of Uruguay and Brazil. Most species accept both morphs of cowbird eggs, two reject both morphs, and one (Chalk-browed Mockinbird, Mimus saturninus) rejects immaculate eggs but accepts spotted ones. No species, via its rejection behavior, protects the Shiny Cowbird from competition with a potential competitor, the sympatric Screaming Cowbird (M. rufoaxillaris). Cross-fostering experiments and natural-history observations indicate that nestling cowbirds require a diet composed of animal protein. Because most passerines provide their nestlings with such food, host selection is little restricted by diet. Species-specific nest survivorship, adjusted to appropriate values of Shiny Cowbird life-history variables, varied by over an order of magnitude. Shiny Cowbirds peck host eggs. This density-dependent source of mortality lowers the survivorship of nests of preferred hosts and creates natural selection for greater generalization. Host quality is sensitive to the natural-history attributes of each host species and to the behavior of cowbirds at nests.
4085756|A total of 678 specimens of Leach's Storm-Petrels (Oceanodroma leucorhoa) from known nesting localities was examined, and 514 were measured. Rump color, classified on a scale of 1-11 by comparison with a series of reference specimens, varied geographically but was found to be a poor character on which to base taxonomic definitions. Significant differences in five size characters indicated that the presently accepted, but rather confusing, taxonomy should be altered: (1) O. l. beali, O. l. willetti, and O. l. chapmani should be merged into O. l. leucorhoa; (2) O. l. socorroensis should refer only to the summer breeding population on Guadalupe Island; and (3) the winter breeding Guadalupe population should be recognized as a "new" subspecies, based on physiological, morphological, and vocal characters, with the proposed name O. l. cheimomnestes. The clinal and continuous size variation in this species is related to oceanographic climate, length of migration, mobility during the nesting season, and distances between nesting islands. Why oceanitids frequenting nearshore waters during nesting are darker rumped than those offshore remains an unanswered question, as does the more basic question of why rump color varies geographically in this species.

4088313|We studied (1983-1987) the provisioning and growth of nestling Rhinoceros Auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata) in a breeding colony on the Lucy Islands and measured growth (1984-1986) in other colonies also on the British Columbia coast (Pine Island and Triangle Island). There were strong differences in the pattern of provisioning among the three years. In 1985 provisioning peaked around the midpoint (30 days) of the nestling period and then declined rapidly. In 1986, provisioning also declined after the midpoint, but more slowly than in 1985. In 1987, provisioning remained approximately constant during the entire breeding season. We found no evidence that late-hatched chicks were consistently fed less than early-hatched chicks, though the statistical power of the tests made to detect this difference was low. There were significant annual differences in chick growth. Growth was fastest in 1985, intermediate in 1984 and 1986, and slowest in 1983 and 1987. The mean growth rate on the three colonies changed in unison from year to year. Hypotheses based on seasonal environmental changes and on systematic changes in the food requirements of growing chicks do not explain the observed patterns. Our data on chick growth and independent data on ocean production suggest that the two varied directly and in unison among years. However, provisioning in the latter part of chick development did not appear to reflect directly the quality of ocean feeding conditions. We conclude that although large-scale fluctuations in ocean production are likely to be the dominant influence upon provisioning, the manner in which parents respond to such variation is poorly understood.

10.2307/4090053| Previous reports have stated that Tufted Puffins (Fratercula cirrhata) lose all of their flight feathers simultaneously (or nearly so) during flight-feather molt and replace them in no apparent order. In contrast, we found that captive second-year (SY) Tufted Puffins (1) typically require 15 and 10 days to lose their primaries and secondaries, respectively, during their first flight-feather molt, and an average of 21 days to lose all of their remiges; and (2) replace their primaries in either of two discrete sequences. In 9 of 13 birds, primary molt began at the innermost primary, P1, and progressed distally to the outermost functional primary, P10. However, in the remaining four birds, primary molt began in the middle of the primaries (P5-P7) and progressed both distally to P10 and proximally toward P1. Before the proximal wave reached P1, a second wave of molt was initiated at P1 and progressed distally, typically replacing P2 and P3 before reaching the proximal wave. Such polymorphism in flight-feather molt sequence is rare in birds, having been reported previously only in a few passerine species. Secondary molt began about 13 days after onset of primary molt and finished at about the same time as primary molt, resulting in a total duration of flight-feather molt of 54 days and a flightless period of 40 days. /// Se ha establecido mediante reportes previos que las aves de la especie Fratercula cirrhata pierden todas sus plumas de vuelo simultneamente (o casi) durante la muda de las plumas de vuelo, y que las reemplazan sin un orden aparente.

4088471|Flight morphology affects aerodynamic performance and the energetic demand for migration. We investigated the relationship between flight morphology and energetic condition of Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), Veery (Catharus fuscescens), Swainson's Thrush (C. ustulatus), and Gray-cheeked Thrush (C. minimus) during migration and the consequences for stopover behavior following spring trans-Gulf passage. Differences in morphological variables were found among Catharus thrushes, and between Wood Thrush and Catharus thrushes. Species with longer migratory distances have longer, more pointed wings and higher aspect ratios. The relatively larger wing area and lower body mass of Gray-cheeked Thrush and Veery result in lower wing loadings. Whereas wing size increased with increasing lean body mass in all species, the interrelations of wing span and wing area with lean body mass were allometrical (i.e. deviated from expected isometric relationship). Larger individuals in each species have disproportionately large wings. Wing size was negatively related to amount of stored fat, which indicated that larger individuals within each species have smaller fat stores remaining after trans-Gulf migration. Species or individuals with relatively long, pointed wings are more efficient migrants, and their energetic demand per unit distance travelled is lower. The consequences vis-a-vis stopover biology are considered.
10.2307/4088264|We studied restriction-fragment length polymorphisms (RELPs) in mitochondrial DNA for 13 species of African francolins (Francolinus spp.) and the Japanese Quail (Coturnix c. japonica). Phylogenetic analyses of RFLPs for these 14 species and of morphological and behavioral characters for the 41 francolin species and other perdicine taxa do not confirm the monophyly of Francolinus as currently recognized. Analyses of morpho-behavioral characters suggest that Francolinus consists of at least four major assemblages: the five Asiatic species; two groups of African quail-like species; and the African partridge-like species. Within these assemblages, analyses of RFLPs and/or morpho-behavioral characters support the monophyly of six of eight species groups attributed to Francolinus. Assuming the monophyly of currently recognized supraspecific groups of galliform birds, morphometric analyses of galliform skeletons correctly classified 90-99% of specimens to family, subfamily and tribe, as well as 95% of the francolin specimens to genus. Genetic distances derived from RFLP data imply that African francolins diverged from their sister taxa at or before the mid-late Miocene, and that all species studied diverged from their sister-species during the Pliocene or early Pleistocene.
4085754| The three species of the genus Pygoscelis, P. adeliae (Adlie Penguin), P. antarctica (Chinstrap Penguin), and P. papua (Gentoo Penguin) perform an elaborate Nest Relief Ceremony (NRC) upon one mate's return to the nest. The NRC consists of a number of displays, each of which is performed one or several times. The most conspicuous displays during NRC are the Loud Mutual Display (LMD) and Quiet Mutual Display (QMD) in P. adeliae and P. antarctica, and their morphologically different functional equivalents in P. papua, the "donkey call" (LMD) and "bow-gape-hiss" (BGH). The displays whose repetition rate is negatively correlated with the time elapsed between arrival of the mate and actual changeover are the LMD in P. adeliae, "circling" in P. antarctica, and BGH in P. papua. 
10.2307/4089899| John T. Zimmer described Xiphorhynchus necopinus (Zimmer's Woodcreeper) as a sibling species of the more widespread Xiphorhynchus picus (Straight-billed Woodcreeper). Despite his initial suspicion that a preexisting name (kienerii) could be applied to the new species he described, Zimmer discarded that possibility without directly examining the type of X. p. kienerii housed at the Museum National D'Histoire Naturelle in Paris, France. We studied plumage and measured wing chord and tail lengths of the type specimen of X. p. kienerii, comparing it with series of specimens of X. necopinus and X. picus. We show that X. necopinus and the type of X. p. kienerii are morphologically and morphometrically indistinguishable, and thus necopinus is synonymized with kienerii, the name that has priority. Because Zimmer mistakenly applied the name kienerii to a western Amazonian population of X. picus, most specimens in museums identified as X. p. kienerii after Zimmer's review (Zimmer 1934) are likely to refer to X. p. peruvianus. /// John T.

10.2307/4089926| Black-legged Kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla) nest at 25 distinct colonies located throughout Prince William Sound that range in size from <20 to >7,000 pairs. Dramatic changes have occurred in the distribution of breeding birds among those colonies during the past few decades (1972-1997). Reproductive success data collected since 1985 confirm that individual colonies are habitat patches of varying quality in space and time. Even with such variation, predictability of habitat quality did occur in short- and long-term (3 year) intervals as indicated by significant (P < 0.05) relationships between current (t) and previous year's (t-1, t-2, etc.) reproductive success. Those circumstances provided suitable conditions for testing hypotheses concerning dispersal and recruitment strategies of a long-lived species. Breeding birds responded to both short- and long-term cues and, in general, recruited to the most successful colonies. An apparently lower dispersal propensity and the importance of long-term cues was in contrast to a similar study of kittiwake colonies in France (Danchin et al. 1998). Differences between these studies may be attributed to primary factors controlling habitat quality in Prince William Sound operating in the long-term versus the short-term and the magnitude of scale. Colonies in our study covered a much larger geographic area and therefore, factors such as foraging-site faithfulness, mate retention, and natal philopatry may also have influenced dispersal decisions. Nonetheless, recruitment of kittiwakes in Prince William Sound supported the performance-based conspecific attraction hypothesis, which, in turn, led to an ideal free distribution of breeding birds. Those shortterm mechanisms for dispersal and recruitment manifested in a long-term redistribution of nesting kittiwakes from poor breeding conditions in southern Prince William Sound to favorable conditions in northern Prince William Sound. Favorable conditions in northern Prince William Sound were apparently supported by stable or increasing populations of juvenile herring. In contrast, reproductive failures and population declines in southern Prince William Sound were concordant with colonies in the Gulf of Alaska where diets were similar, consisting of primarily capelin (Mallotus villosus) and Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus). Those trends corresponded with the influence of Gulf of Alaska waters in southern Prince William Sound and may have been associated with a reported decline in the abundance of key forage species related to a late 1970s regime shift in the Gulf of Alaska.

4085157|This paper describes the hunting tactics of the Tiny Hawk, Accipiter superciliosus fontanieri, in a Costa Rican rain forest, where it appears to be a hummingbird specialist. Three tactics were used by the hawks to hunt hummingbirds: typical Accipiter still-hunting (probably not specifically for hummingbirds), waiting in ambush by a hummingbird's regular territorial perch, and flying rapidly between the perches of several territorial hummingbirds. Relative use of the latter two tactics may reflect the local density of territorial hummingbirds.
25150342|The potential for differences between genetic paternity and paternity inferred from behavioral observation has long been recognized. These differences are associated with the challenge for females of seeking both genetic and material benefits; this challenge is less severe in species with polygynous, non-resource-based mating systems (such as leks) than in those with resource-based systems. We present the first study of paternity patterns in a non-resource-based species that does not form true leks. We compared paternity inferred from observed mating behavior to genetically assigned paternity in the Satin Bowerbird (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus) using eight microsatellite markers. Mating behavior was observed and recorded via automated video-cameras positioned at all bowers (29-34 bowers each year) in the study site throughout each mating season. We obtained blood samples and identified mothers for 11 chicks in 9 nests. For all chicks, the most likely genetic father had been observed to mate with the mother in the year the chick was sampled. All most likely genetic fathers were assigned with high confidence and all were bower-holding males. These results demonstrate that genetic paternity can be inferred from observed mating behavior with reasonable confidence in Satin Bowerbirds. Observed male mating-success is therefore a reliable predictor of reproductive success, and this suggests that high skew in observed male mating-success translates directly to high skew in reproductive success. /// Las diferencias potenciales entre la paternidad gentica y la paternidad inferida a partir de observaciones de comportamiento han sido reconocidas desde hace mucho tiempo. Estas diferencias estn asociadas con el desafo de las hembras de buscar beneficios genticos y materiales. Este desafo es menos severo en las especies con sistemas de apareamiento polignicos que no estn basados en los recursos (como las asambleas de cortejo) que en aquellas con sistemas basados en los recursos. Presentamos el primer estudio de patrones de paternidad en una especie cuyo apareamiento no est basado en los recursos y que no forma asambleas de cortejo verdaderas. Comparamos la paternidad inferida a partir de observaciones de comportamientos de apareamiento con la paternidad asignada genticamente en Ptilonorhynchus violaceus usando ocho marcadores micro-satelitales. El comportamiento de apareamiento fue observado y registrado por medio de cmaras de video automticas ubicadas en todos los sitios de despliegue (29-34 sitios de despliegue cada ao) en el rea de estudio a lo largo de cada estacin reproductiva. Obtuvimos muestras de sangre e identificamos las madres de 11 pichones en 9 nidos. Para todos los pichones, el padre gentico ms probable fue observado aparendose con la madre en el ao en que el pichn fue muestreado. Todos los padres genticos ms probables fueron determinados con alta seguridad y todos fueron machos que ocuparon un sitio de despliegue. Estos resultados demuestran que la paternidad gentica puede ser inferida a partir de la observacin del comportamiento de apareamiento con una grado razonable de certeza en P. violaceus. Por lo tanto, el xito de apareamiento observado de los machos predice el xito reproductivo de modo confiable, y esto sugiere que los sesgos marcados en el xito de apareamiento observados en los machos se traducen directamente en sesgos marcados en el xito reproductivo.
10.2307/4086895|Using data from the field and the literature on 67 species of birds, we analyzed intraclutch variation in egg size, especially the deviation of the last egg from the clutch mean (D). Values of D are closer to zero in precocial than in altricial species; D is negatively correlated with body size in interspecific comparisons, i.e. large birds, including precocial species, lay small final eggs; and D is higher in open-nesting passerines (on average D = +3.56%, 17 species) than in hole-nesting species (on average D = -0.05%, 13 species). Within populations of birds, a negative relationship exists between D and clutch size, particularly in species that have a generally low value of D. The results support the view that intraclutch variation in egg size has an ultimate, adaptive value. We suggest that birds adopting the "brood-reduction strategy" have a small final egg, particularly those birds with large clutches, whereas birds adopting the "brood-survival strategy" have a relatively large final egg, particularly those birds with large clutches.
4087181| We used allozyme electrophoresis to estimate the degree of genetic differentiation among allopatric and sympatric populations of American Black Ducks (Anas rubripes) and Mallards (A. platyrhynchos). Mallards were collected in California, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario, and Black Ducks were collected in Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and Ontario. The mean genetic distances, D, between Black Duck populations (0.0007), between Mallard populations (0.0010), and between Mallard and Black Duck populations (0.0006) were virtually identical; there was as much genetic differentiation within the two species as there was between them. Such small genetic distances are characteristic of local populations of avian species in other orders, and are consistent with what is known about the lack of reproductive isolation between Black Ducks and Mallards. Although the two taxa are still somewhat split on an east-west basis, our genetic data do not support even subspecific status for the Black Duck. 
10.2307/4088008|We investigated the effects of body mass of incubating female Wood Ducks (Aix sponsa) on aspects of their current and future reproduction, and we examined factors that affect length of the incubation period. During three breeding seasons, body mass of female Wood Ducks averaged 578.0 g early and 553.3 g late in the incubation period. Body mass at the start of incubation was not related to either hatching success or length of the incubation period. In one of three years, females that were heavy at the end of incubation survived better to the next breeding season than those that were light. Reduced survival of light females in one year coincided with a greater loss of body mass in that year relative to other years, which indicates that incubation can be an important reproductive cost to female Wood Ducks. There were no relationships between body mass at the end of incubation and date of nesting or clutch size in the next breeding season. Partial correlations between clutch mass and length of incubation that controlled for date of nesting indicated a positive association between clutch mass and incubation length in every year. This relationship was evident only for parasitic nests (i.e. nests in which more than one female was laying eggs). Increased length of the incubation period associated with larger clutch mass represents a potential cost of intraspecific nest parasitism not previously recognized.
10.2307/4089416|To assess natural variation in ejaculate quality of male Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis), as well as to measure any effect of experimental treatment with testosterone (T), we used cloacal massage to collect sperm samples from captive (1993) and free-ranging (1994, 1995) populations. We made three measurements of ejaculate quality in males, approximately half of which had been treated with T: (1) volume, (2) sperm concentration, and (3) total number of sperm per ejaculate (ejaculate size). Ejaculate volume and concentration varied by year, but ejaculate size did not; therefore, we used ejaculate size as our primary measure of ejaculate quality. Control (C-males) and hormone-treated (T-males) males from the captive population did not differ in any measure of ejaculate quality, but in the free-ranging population, C-males produced larger ejaculates than T-males. Independent of treatment, ejaculate size varied significantly with season and stage of reproduction in the free-ranging population. C-males had significantly fewer sperm at the beginning of the breeding season than in midseason and thereafter, but reserves in T-males did not differ significantly with season. For males in both treatments, ejaculates were smallest when their mates were fertile and increased significantly when their mates were incubating and when the pair was feeding nestlings. We then asked whether the observed patterns were more likely attributable to differences in rate of sperm production or rate of sperm utilization (i.e. copulation frequency). The finding that free-ranging T-males had fewer sperm than C-males, whereas captives did not, suggests that treatment with T may have led to differences in utilization (i.e. by copulation). The observation that in both T- and C-males ejaculates were smallest when their mates were fertile also suggests that frequent copulation depletes sperm reserves.

4088361|We recently isolated and cloned a highly repeated retropseudogenelike DNA sequence (RBMI) from the genome of the Red-breasted Merganser (Mergus serrator). This sequence was used to probe Southern blots of restriction-enzyme-digested DNA from members of the waterfowl tribe Anatini in order to infer phylogenetic relationships. The digested DNA of all the species studied contained major and minor RBMI-like components. Some RBMI-like components were common to all the species examined, others were only found in groups of species, and still other were specific to individual species. The Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and the American Black Duck (A. rubripes) could be differentiated on the basis of RBMI-probed Southern blots. Thus, the RBMI sequence can be used to distinguish very closely related species. We suggest that the Anatini consist of three major groups: the mallard-pintail group; the gadwall-wigeon group; and the blue-winged ducks. The Versicolor Teal (A. versicolor) had major elements in common with both the blue-winged ducks and the mallard-pintail group. The Baikal Teal (A. formosa) and the Marbled Teal (Marmaronetta angustirostris) do not appear to be members of any of these three groups.
4086172|Total observed ranges of 24 groups of Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) varied from 34 to 225 ha and averaged 86.9 ha. Groups defended portions of these ranges from adjacent groups year-round. Home ranges were derived from total observed ranges by subtracting extraterritorial areas and areas receiving limited use. The percentage of year-round home-range boundaries determined by intergroup conflicts varied from 0% to 54% and averaged 23.6%. Year-round home ranges averaged 70.3 ha and varied from 30 to 195 ha. The portion of year-round home ranges used in all sampling periods varied from 15% to 65% and averaged 30.5%. The amount of potential foraging habitat per group for all groups within 2,000 m of a study group's colony, a measure of population density relative to available habitat, accounted for 70% of the variation in size of year-round home ranges (P <0.0001). Various measures of group size and habitat quality were weakly related to size of year-round home ranges. Measures of group size and population density together accounted for 80% of the variation in size of year-round home ranges.

Sixty-eight birds were captured and sexed, and foraging behavior (usage of area, defense rate, and foraging efficiency) of 26 birds identified by color bands was observed in detail for 3 years. I categorized territoriality within the foraging area into three types according to the birds' exclusiveness and attachment to the area: high exclusiveness and strong attachment to the same area for a long period, moderate exclusiveness and attachment, and minimal exclusiveness and attachment. Body size was largest and feeding efficiency was highest in the first type. I propose a model that predicts a relationship between body size and defense rate to explain the behavior of egrets. /// Estudi caractersticas de la territorialidad de forrajeo y los efectos del tamao corporal y el sexo sobre la territorialidad en la garza Egretta garzetta.

10.2307/4088592|In order to test hypotheses explaining intraspecific differences in migration patterns of birds, a four-year field study of migrant raptors in southernmost Sweden was undertaken. The age and sex ratios among autumn migrants departing from the province of Scania at Falsterbo were compared to the corresponding ratios among birds of the same species that stayed in Scania the following winter. In most species (Red Kite [Milvus milvus], White-tailed Eagle [Haliaeetus albicilla], Northern Harrier [Circus cyaneus], Goshawk [Accipiter gentilis], Sparrowhawk [A. nisus], Common Buzzard [Buteo buteo] and Eurasian Kestrel [Falco tinnunculus]), the proportion of adults was distinctly higher among wintering birds than among the migrants. A marked exception was the Rough-legged Hawk (B. lagopus), which had significantly more juveniles among the wintering birds. In most species where the sexes could be separated more females were found among the wintering birds than among the migrants (Northern Harrier, Goshawk, Sparrowhawk and Rough-legged Hawk). The Eurasian Kestrel, however, showed the reverse pattern with a higher proportion of males among wintering birds. The results support the social-dominance hypothesis, where the dominant adults and the larger sex (in raptors the female) generally winter furthest north. That juveniles are driven away from the breeding territories is suggested by a significantly higher proportion of juvenile Common Buzzards wintering in marginal coastal regions as compared to the inland portion of Scania. The results are also in general agreement with Bergmann's rule. The higher proportion of male Eurasian Kestrels among wintering birds is most likely explained by the importance of early arrival at the breeding territory.
