1469693| Yields and retention of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN: NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>+NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) and nitrate concentrations in surface runoff are summarized for 28 high elevation watersheds in the Sierra Nevada of California and Rocky Mountains of Wyoming and Colorado. Catchments ranged in elevation from 2475 to 3603 m and from 15 to 1908 ha in area. Soil cover varied from 5% to nearly 97% of total catchment area. Runoff from these snow-dominated catchments ranged from 315 to 1265 mm per year. In the Sierra Nevada, annual volume-weighted mean (AVWM) nitrate concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 13 M (overall average 5.4 M), and peak concentrations measured during snowmelt ranged from 1.0 to 38 M. Nitrate levels in the Rocky Mountain watersheds were about twice those in the Sierra Nevada; average AVWM NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> was 9.4 M and snowmelt peaks ranged from 15 to 50 M. Mean DIN loading to Rocky Mountain watersheds, 3.6 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, was double the average measured for Sierra Nevada watersheds, 1.8 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. DIN yield in the Sierra Nevada, 0.69 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, was about 60% that measured in the Rocky Mountains, 1.1 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>. Net inorganic N retention in Sierra Nevada catchments was 1.2 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> and represented about 55% of annual DIN loading. DIN retention in the Rocky Mountain catchments was greater in absolute terms, 2.5 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>, and as a percentage of DIN loading, 72%. A correlation analysis using DIN yield, DIN retention and surface water nitrate concentrations as dependent variables and eight environmental features (catchment elevation, slope, aspect, roughness, area, runoff, soil cover and DIN loading) as independent variables was conducted. For the Sierra Nevada, elevation and soil cover had significant (p < 0.1) Pearson product moment correlations with catchment DIN yield, AVWM and peak snowmelt nitrate concentrations and DIN retention rates. Log-linear regression models using soil cover as the independent variable explained 82% of the variation in catchment DIN retention, 92% of the variability in AVWM nitrate and 85% of snowmelt peak NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>. In the Rocky Mountains, soil cover was significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with DIN yield, AVWM NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and DIN retention expressed as a percentage of DIN loading (%DIN retention). Catchment mean slope and terrain roughness were positively correlated with steam nitrate concentrations and negatively related to %DIN retention. About 91% of the variation in DIN yield and 79% of the variability in AVWM NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> were explained by log-linear models based on soil cover. A log-linear regression based on soil cover explained 90% of the variation of % DIN retention in the Rocky Mountains. 
41490517|Ria Formosa is a Region of Restricted Exchange given its limited connection to coastal water circulation. Furthermore, it is subject to several anthropogenic activities that can lead to an increase in nutrients and potentially to eutrophication. Previous studies have shown the importance of the benthic compartment, specifically the microphytobenthos (MPB) in this shallow coastal lagoon. The dCSTTMPB model [new version of the dynamic Comprehensive Studies Task Team (dCSTT) model] here described couples the benthic and pelagic compartments. Due to the shallowness of the system, the benthic microalgae are one of the most important primary producers of the system. Preliminary results of the model show a large biomass of benthic microalgae, which strongly influences the pelagic chlorophyll concentration by resuspension. However, algae concentrations in the water column are relatively small due to the high flushing rate of the lagoon. The MPB community is mainly supported by nutrients in the pore water. A sensitivity analysis (SA) has revealed that the factors associated with the benthic compartment were the most important and sensitive to changes. Porosity, benthic chlorophyll recycling, loss of MPB due to grazing and the yield of microphytobenthic chlorophyll from nitrogen were some of the most sensitive parameters, as well as the ones associated with decay of particulate organic nitrogen. The development of our dCSTTMPB model has itself provided insights into benthic function.
20519799|Knowledge about the residence time of lead in the organic horizon (mor layer; O-horizon) overlaying forest mineral soils is important for the prediction of past and future lead levels in the boreal environment. To estimate the mean residence time (MRT) of lead in the mor layer, we use in this study from Northern Sweden three different approaches: (1) lead-210 is applied as a tracer of lead migration; (2) estimations of loss rates of stable lead (concentrations and Pb/Pb ratios) from the mor layer at an undisturbed forest setting, and (3) a study of lead in a soil series with sites of different age (a chronosequence of 20-220 years). In the last two approaches we compared measured inventories in the soil with estimated inventories derived using analyses of lake sediments. The results suggested a MRT of about 250 years in the mor layer in the mature forest and in the older parts of the chronosequence it was at least &gt;170 years. The agreement between the three different approaches gives good credibility to this estimate. It is also supported by a modeling of trends in the Pb/Pb ratio both between single cores and with depth in the mor layer. Our results suggest that it will take centuries for the deeper parts of the mor layer of undisturbed boreal forest soils to fully respond to decreased atmospheric lead pollution. However, data from the chronosequence indicate that the response could be much faster (MRT&lt; 50 years) in the mor layer at early stages of forest succession where graminoid and broadleaved litter fall dominates over conifer litter.

41490476|Rivers draining watersheds that include carbonate bedrock or organic matter (OM)-rich sedimentary rocks frequently have C-depleted dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) relative to rivers draining carbonate-and OM-free watersheds, due to dissolution of carbonate and/or decomposition of ancient OM. However, our results from a subtropical river, the Brazos River in Texas, USA, show that in this watershed human activities appear to dominate basin lithology in controlling the origin and metabolism of DIC. The middle Brazos flows through limestone and coal-bearing bedrock, but DIC isotope data suggest no limestone dissolution or respiration of ancient OM, and instead reflect efficient air-water CO exchange, degradation of relatively young OM and photosynthesis in the river as a result of river damming and urban treated wastewater input. The lower Brazos drains only small areas of carbonate and coal-bearing bedrock, but DIC isotope data suggest the strong influence of carbonate dissolution, with a potentially minor contribution from decomposition of old soil organic matter (SOM). Oyster shells and crushed carbonate minerals used in road construction are likely sources of carbonate in the lower Brazos, in addition to natural marl and pedogenic carbonate. Additionally, the generally low pCO and high DIC concentration in the Brazos River lead to a low CO outgassing: DIC export ratio, distinguishing the Brazos River from other rivers.
1469561|Certain general circulation models predict that a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations will increase the frequency of summer drought in northern wetlands due to hotter, drier summers. There is currently much uncertainty as to how drought will affect emissions of the greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide, from wetlands. We have demonstrated that an eight centimetre drawdown of the water table in a gully mire does not significantly affect nitrous oxide emissions from this site. However, under a more extreme drought scenario carried out on peat monoliths, nitrous oxide emissions increased exponentially with a linear decrease in water table height. Drought caused a significant increase in nitrous oxide production below the water table but most of the total increase could be attributed to increased emissions above the water table. Results from an acetylene block experiment suggested that increased emissions were caused by increased nitrous oxide production from denitrification, rather than by increased production from nitrification. In the laboratory study, drought severity had no effect on peatwater nitrate concentrations below the water table, however, increasing drought severity decreased ammonium concentrations.
40980875|Belowground respiration is typically the largest flux of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere, making up > 70% of total respiration in boreal forests. Recent work has shown that belowground respiration continues during the snowcovered season in boreal ecosystems, but few studies have made complementary measurements during the snow-free season and it remains uncertain what proportion of annual belowground respiration occurs during winter. Traditional models of the relationship between temperature and respiration assume fixed temperature sensitivity, but it has become clear that the apparent temperature sensitivity of belowground respiration increases as soils approach 0C. Use of fixed temperature sensitivity to model carbon budgets of northern ecosystems may, therefore, yield misleading results. We measured belowground respiration monthly over 2 years in four ecosystems along an elevation gradient in south-central Alaska. Three models, representing different hypotheses about the relationship between temperature and respiration, were confronted with the data. A logistic model, which allows the temperature sensitivity to vary inversely with temperature, and a variation of the Q model, which allows the temperature sensitivity to vary seasonally, performed well at all sites and produced similar estimates of seasonal and annual belowground respiration. The traditional Q model performed poorly at all sites and overestimated respiration during the snow-covered season. Annual belowground respiration was generally greater than in ecosystems of interior Alaska, where winters are colder and summers are warmer and drier. Belowground respiration during the snow-covered season made up 6-15% of the annual total a small, but sensitive, component of annual carbon budgets.
40343750|Topographic factors affect nitrogen cycling in forest soils, including nitrous oxide (NO) emissions, which contribute to the greenhouse effect. We measured the NO flux at 14 chambers placed along a 65-m transect on a slope for 1 year at 2-to 3-week intervals. We applied a hierarchical Bayesian model with a conditional autoregressive (CAR) model to assess the spatiotemporal NO flux along a slope and quantify the effects of environmental factors on NO emissions. NO fluxes at chambers located at lower positions along the slope were relatively greater than those at higher positions. During the non-soilfreezing period, NO fluxes fluctuated seasonally depending on soil temperature. The soil temperature dependency of NO fluxes at each chamber increased with descending slope position (the median of the Q equivalent simulated from posterior distribution ranged from 1.18 to 3.64). According to the Bayesian hierarchical model, this trend could be partially explained by the C/N ratio at each chamber position. During the soil-freezing period, relatively high NO fluxes were observed at lower positions along the slope.
1469677|Soils contain various iron compounds that differ in solubility, reducibility and extractability. Moreover, the contribution of the various iron compounds to total iron (Fe) and total Fe concentrations differs highly among soils. As a result, the total reducible Fe content can also differ among soils, and so does the dynamics of iron reduction. These factors complicate the prediction of reducible Fe based on Fe extraction data and hamper the application of process-based models for reduced or waterlogged soils where redox processes play a key-role. This paper presents a theoretical analysis relating reducible to extractable Fe reported in the literature. Predictions made from this theoretical analysis were evaluated in soil incubations using 18 rice paddy soils from all over the world. The incubation studies and the literature study both show that reducible Fe can be related to Fe from some selected, but not all, iron extractions. The combination of measurements for labile Fe(III)oxides (derived from oxalate-extractable Fe) and stabile Fe(III)oxides (derived from dithionite-citrate-extractable Fe) shows highly significant correlations with reducible Fe with high coefficients of determination (r<sup>2</sup>=0.92-0.95 depending on the definition of stabile Fe(III)oxides). Given the high diversity in rice soils used for the incubations, these regression equations will have general applicability. Application of these regression equations in combination with soil database information may improve the predictive ability of process-based models where soil redox processes are important, such as CH<sub>4</sub> emission models derived for rice paddies or wetlands.
1468786|Path analysis was used to determine the importance of long-term disturbance regime and the relative importances of correlations among vegetation patterns, disturbance history, and nitrogen (N) mineralization in old-growth forests of northwestern Minnesota. Leaf biomass (estimated by allometric equations), fire history (from fire scars on Pinus resinosa trees), and N mineralization rates (estimated from incubations in situ) were determined from sample plots dominated by - Betula papyrifera, Populus tremuloides, and P. grandidentata, - a mixture of Acer saccharum and Tilia americana, or - Quercus borealis and Ostrya virginiana. Results showed that topographic and soil-moisture controls on N mineralization, vegetation patterns, and disturbance are substantially stronger than is suggested by direct correlation. Indirect interactions among ecosystem variables played in important role. These interactions probably include the tendency for species that cycle large amounts of N to colonize more mesic sites that burned rarely in the past. Soil moisture was correlated both directly with N mineralization and indirectly, through its effects on vegetation pattern, and thus, litter quality. Although disturbance regime also depended on topography, the strengths of relationships between disturbance regime and other variables were relatively weak. These dependencies suggested that long-term fire regime is probably more a consequence than a cause for vegetation and fertility patterns. Topography, through its effects on soil moisture and microclimate, is an overriding influence on ecosystem properties, which in turn influence fire regime.
1469578|Soil phosphorus (P) dynamics are controlled by the interaction of geochemical, biochemical and biological processes. Changes in species composition or management could alter the relative importance of these processes. We examined soil P dynamics in two plantations of N<sub>2</sub>-fixing red alder (Alnus rubra) by determining the fate and effects of added fertilizer P. History of the plantations varied such that sites were previously occupied by 60-yr-old stands of alder or non-fixing Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). Without fertilization, the soil with a longer period of alder influence had more organic P (P<sub>o</sub>) and less sorbed inorganic P (Hydroxide- and Bicarb-extractable P<sub>i</sub>). Fertilization increased soil total P, and 88% of the fertilizer was accounted for in the surface mineral soil (0-15 cm). Sorbed P<sub>i</sub> was the major sink for fertilizer P (55-60%), independent of site history. Although P<sub>o</sub> was 35-70% of soil P in unfertilized plots, added P did not accumulate as P<sub>o</sub>. Neither site history nor P addition influenced phosphatase activity. Fertilization increased decomposition during incubation of the organic horizon, suggesting that late-stage decomposition is P-limited in these N-rich soils. On the time-scale of a few years, geochemical sorption and desorption of inorganic P were the most important processes controlling the distribution of added P. Organic P accumulation is expected to occur over a longer time frame, linked to the production and turnover of organic matter.
41490545|Wildfire in California annual grasslands is an important ecological disturbance and ecosystem control. Regional and global climate changes that affect aboveground biomass will alter fire-related nutrient loading and promote increased frequency and severity of fire in these systems. This can have longterm impacts on soil microbial dynamics and nutrient cycling, particularly in N-limited systems such as annual grasslands. We examined the effects of a lowseverity fire on microbial biomass and specific microbial lipid biomarkers over 3 years following a fire at the Jasper Ridge Global Change Experiment. We also examined the impact of fire on the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), specifically Nitrosospira Cluster 3a ammonia-oxidizers, and nitrification rates 9 months post-fire. Finally, we examined the interactive effects of fire and three other global change factors (N-deposition, precipitation and CO) on plant biomass and soil microbial communities for three growing seasons after fire. Our results indicate that a low-severity fire is associated with earlier season primary productivity and higher soil-NH concentrations in the first growing season following fire. Belowground productivity and total microbial biomass were not influenced by fire. Diagnostic microbial lipid biomarkers, including those for Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria, were reduced by fire 9-and 21-months post-fire, respectively. All effects of fire were indiscernible by 33-months post-fire, suggesting that above and belowground responses to fire do not persist in the long-term and that these grassland communities are resilient to fire disturbance. While N-deposition increased soil NH, and thus available NH, AOB abundance, nitrification rates and Cluster 3a AOB, similar increases in NH in the fire plots did not affect AOB or nitrification. We hypothesize that this difference in response to N-addition involves a mediation of P-limitation as a result of fire, possibly enhanced by increased plant competition and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi-plant associations after fire.
4151499|The decomposition of belowground and aboveground tree litter was studied on five forest sites across Switzerland, ranging from 480 to 1500 m in altitude, and including calcareous and acidic soils. In addition to decomposition of local litter types (Picea abies, Fagus sylvatica, Castanea sativa), the decomposition of a standard beech litter was studied on all sites. After 2 years of decomposition, mass loss ranged from 18 to 71% across the different sites and litter types. The lowest decomposition rates were observed for beech roots, while mass loss was greatest for both spruce needles and spruce roots at the low-altitude site. Mass loss during the first winter correlated best with the content of watersoluble substances. After 1 year of incubation, mass loss of the standard litter varied less than did mass loss of local litter, but variance increased during the second year for aboveground litter. These observations indicate a smaller climatic influence on litter breakdown at the beginning of the decomposition process. Litter mass loss could be described using an exponential model with a decay constant depending on either lignin/N ratio or Mn content of the litter and annual soil temperature and throughfall precipitation as climatic variables. Modelling the observed mass loss indicated a strong influence of litter quality in the first 2 years of decomposition, confirming the field data from the standard litter experiment. The experiment will continue for some years and is expected to yield additional data on long-term decomposition.
40800609|We synthesized available data for decomposition of pine (Pinus) needle litter in pine forests to determine the litter chemical characteristics and climate factors that explained variation in the limit value, i.e. the level of accumulated mass loss at which the decomposition process either continues at a very low rate or possibly stops. Our data base included 56 separate studies on decomposition of pine needle litter, spanning Scots pine, lodgepole pine, Aleppo pine, stone pine and white pine, mainly incubated at the site of collection. Studies had 5 to 19 samplings, on average 10, and the decomposition was followed to a mass loss ranging from 47 to 83%, on average 67%. The periods from 3.0 to 5.4 years, on average 3.9 years, were of sufficient duration to allow estimates of limit values of decomposition. We used a linear mixed model with regression effects to relate limit values to potential explanatory variables, namely the sites' long-term mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP) and to substrate-chemistry factors. Regarding the latter, we explored two models; one that included initial concentrations of water solubles, lignin, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and Mn and one that included only lignin, N, Ca, and Mn to focus on those nutrients known to influence lignin degradation. Using backward elimination significant explanatory variables were determined. For litter decomposed in its site of origin we found the limit value to depend mainly on the initial concentration of Mn, with higher Mn concentrations resulting in higher accumulated mass loss. Thus, litter with higher Mn reached a higher limit value and left a smaller stable fraction. This is likely due to the fact that Mn is an essential component of ligninolytic enzymes important for degrading litter in the later stages of decomposition. Manganese has received little attention in decomposition studies to date. Given its significance in this synthesis, the role of Mn in influencing variation in the late stages of decomposition among ecosystems and among litters of other genera besides Pinus deserves further attention.
41490480|The effect of water table fluctuations on the interaction between nitrogen mineralization in buried organic-rich soil horizons and nitrate mobilization into groundwater was examined in the riparian zone of a small headwater agricultural catchment in southern Ontario, Canada. Riparian soils contained buried organic layers and lenses overlying a poorly sorted gravel layer at a depth of 0.8-1.0 m. The riparian water table in summer 2006 generally remained within 0.4 m of the surface, whereas during a major drought in 2007 the water table declined to > 1.9 m in August and riparian soils above the gravel layer inland from the stream remained unsaturated from mid-June to early November. Mean daily net N mineralization and nitrification rates during 2-4 week in situ soil incubations were 0.2-1.35 mg N kg- day- in 0-10 cm surface soils in May-September 2006, whereas N mineralization and nitrification were negligible at 30 45 and 60-75 cm soil depths. In summer and fall 2007, high daily rates of N mineralization and nitrification of 0.3-0.8 mg N kg- day occurred at 30-45 and 60-75 cm depths that were similar to surface soil rates. The soil nitrate pool at 60-75 cm depth was 16X larger in autumn 2007 in comparison to 2006. During high water tables in November 2006 groundwater in the gravel layer had low N  N concentrations of < 0.1 mg 1 1 . In contrast, after the drought in 2007 nitrate was flushed into groundwater as the water table rose to within 30-50 cm of the surface in December. An extensive area of high NON concentrations (3-18 mg 1 1 ) occurred inland from the stream bank. This zone of high nitrates declined gradually by April 2008 probably as a result of denitrification. These results indicate that buried organic deposits at depth within riparian areas can be important nitrogen sources during major water table drawdowns. The influence of these episodes of mineralization at depth during droughts on riparian groundwater chemistry and the emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere merit further research.
40980893|Climate change is projected to increase mean temperature of northern lakes by the end of the twenty-first century. To simulate this scenario, during 2004-2007 we imposed artificial mixing in Halsjrvi, a small, polyhumic, boreal lake in southern Finland, to increase the depth of the thermocline by ~ 1.5 m. The aims of the experiment were to evaluate potential effects of climate change on biogeochemical cycles, especially of mercury, and on food web structure, productivity and biodiversity in dystrophic lake ecosystems. Following the initial depression of the thermocline in the experimental lake, the methyl mercury (MeHg) concentration in small European perch (Perca fluviatlis L.) decreased and remained lower throughout the study. In contrast, perch in a nearby reference lake exhibited increased MeHg during the same period. The N values of the muscle tissue of perch were similar in both lakes over the study period, suggesting that the trophic position of perch remained unchanged. However, C values of perch became clearly more negative in Halsjrvi, probably due to the greater mixing of the water column that resulted in changes in the carbon sources for the food web. A marked decrease of epilimnetic MeHg concentrations recorded during the experiment was considered to be the main reason for the decreased MeHg concentrations in perch. The results suggest that oxygen-related changes induced by climate change will be more important than direct temperature changes for MeHg accumulation in fish in small humic lakes with persistent oxygen deficiency in the hypolimnion.
41410607|Although sediments of the German Wadden Sea are suspected to eliminate a considerable share of nitrate delivered to the SE North Sea, their denitrification rates have not been systematically assessed. We determined N production rates over seasonal cycles (February 2009-April 2010) at two locations with two sediments types each, the first site (Meldorf Bight) receiving nitrate during all seasons from the Elbe river plume, and a second site on the island of Sylt, where nitrate is depleted during summer months. In sediments from the Sylt site, N production ranged from 15 to 32 mol N m h in the fine sand station and from 7 to 13 mol N m h in the coarse sand station; N production was not detected when nitrate was depleted in May and July of 2009. N production in the Meldorf Bight sediments were consistently detected at higher rates (58-130 mol N m h in the very fine sand station and between 14 and 30 mol N m h in the medium sand station). Analysis of ancillary parameters suggests that major factors controlling N production in coastal sediments of the German Wadden Sea are the nitrate concentrations in the overlying water, the ambient temperature, and the organic matter content of the sediment. Extrapolating our spot measurements to the zone of nitrate availability and sediment types, we estimate an annual nitrogen removal rate around 16 kt N year for the entire northern sector of the German Wadden Sea area. This corresponds to 14% of the annual Elbe river nitrogen load.
23359740|Many terrestrial soils in the US Midwest are temporally flooded during the spring. The effects of short-term flooding on biogeochemical processes that occur in these soils are not fully understood and are the subject of this study. To evaluate these processes we investigated the redox-induced changes in the soil solution for three-cultivated and three-uncultivated/forest soils with different organic matter concentrations. The soils were flooded for 1, 3, 7, and 14-days under anoxic conditions in a biogeochemical reactor. Samples were analyzed for Eh; pH; NO 3 - ; NH 4 + ; total dissolved Mn and Fe; soluble P; dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOCDIC); and evolved CO 2 . We found strongly contrasting responses of the terrestrial soils to flooding. Reducing conditions were established quickly in the uncultivated and more slowly in the cultivated soils. Concomitant changes in pH were higher for the uncultivated soils. The uncultivated soils showed a higher increase in the amount of NH 4 + , P, Fe, Mn than the cultivated soils over the 14-day incubation. The total amount of carbon decomposed was much greater for the uncultivated soils with approximately 900 g C (CO 2 + DOC + DIC) decomposed per gram of soil compared to a total decomposition of 240 g C ${\mathrm{g}}_{\mathrm{s}\mathrm{o}\mathrm{i}\mathrm{l}}^{-1}$ for the cultivated soils indicating differences in the type of carbon decomposed. The rapid onset of reducing conditions for the uncultivated soils is attributed to a reactive carbon component that is either absent or occluded in the cultivated soils. This study demonstrates that the biogeochemically-induced changes in carbon dynamics in terrestrial soils are strongly influenced by short-term flooding and the history of soil management.
1469533|Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and export were studied in two small catchments in central Ontario to examine DOC sources and to assess the hypothesis that organic matter adjacent to the stream is a significant contributor of DOC during storms. Different DOC dynamics and exports were observed according to the depth of the riparian water table. In Harp 4-21, riparian flowpaths were predominantly through A and upper B soil horizons and riparian soils contributed between 73 and 84% of the stream DOC export during an autumn storm. In Harp 3A, riparian flowpaths were predominantly through lower B horizons. Consequently, riparian soils were less important and hillslopes contributed more than 50% of the stream DOC export in subcatchments without wetlands during storms. Wetlands and adjacent soils contributed significantly to DOC export in Harp 3A; 8% of the total catchment area exported 32 to 46% of the storm runoff DOC. DOC export dynamics in wetlands and riparian soils were distinctly different. In wetlands, transport was affected by leaching and flushing of DOC at the wetland surface leading to lower DOC concentrations with successive storms. In riparian soils, groundwater flowpaths were more important and stronger positive relationships between discharge and DOC concentration were observed. Precipitation, throughfall and stemflow were minor sources of stream DOC during storms and contributed less than 20% of the total export.
20519792|Since 1987 we have studied weekly change in winter (December-April) precipitation, snowpack, snowmelt, soil water, and stream water solute flux in a small (176-ha) Northern Michigan watershed vegetated by 65-85 year-old northern hardwoods. Our primary study objective was to quantify the effect of change in winter temperature and precipitation on watershed hydrology and solute flux. During the study winter runoff was correlated with precipitation, and forest soils beneath the snowpack remained unfrozen. Winter air temperature and soil temperature beneath the snowpack increased while precipitation and snowmelt declined. Atmospheric inputs declined for H,

The
1469040|The seasonal variation in sulfate reduction and the dynamics of sulfur and iron geochemistry were studied throughout a year in sediment of Aarhus Bay, Denmark. A radiotracer method for measuring sulfate reduction rates was applied with incubation times down to 15 min and a depth resolution down to 2 mm in the oxidized surface layer of the sediment. The radiotracer data were analyzed by a mathematical model which showed that, due to partial, rapid reoxidation of radioactive sulfide during incubation, the actual reduction rates in this layer were probably underestimated 5-fold. In the deeper, sulfidic zone, measured rates appeared to be correct. Sulfate reduction followed the seasonal variation in temperature with maximum activity at 1-2 cm depth in late summer. In spite of its rapid production, free H<sub>2</sub>S was detectable in the porewater only below the depth of free Fe<sup>2+</sup> at 6-7 cm throughout the year. Following the massive sedimentation from a spring phytoplankton bloom, anaerobic degradation of phytoplankton detritus was strongly stimulated over several weeks. A transient reversed redox zonation developed with a thin, black zone on top of the brown, oxidized sediment layer due to intensive sulfate and iron reduction. Mineralization through sulfate reduction was equivalent to two thirds of the annual net sedimentation of organic matter.
20456485|Knowledge of the complex life cycle of Phaeocystis is a key to understanding its role in marine ecosystems and global biogeochemistry. An existing life cycle model was modified and used to integrate understanding of the Phaeocystis life cycle. In model-driven research, models expose gaps in our understanding, empirical studies ensue, and feedback improves understanding. Following this scheme, three facets of the life cycle model were examined here. With four exceptions, the empirical studies described have been presented in other literature citations. The first facet involved testing for the existence of a process or producing its description. These studies included: demonstration of in vitro colony division in Phaeocystis pouchetii, description of in vitro change in colony shape for P. pouchetii associated with senescence, determining which P. pouchetii life stage is vulnerable to viral infection and lysis, and an experiment designed to determine whether the sediment could be a source of new Phaeocystis colonies to overlying waters; results suggested that more-detailed investigation of benthic particles as a physical substrate for colony formation is warranted. The second facet involved investigation of process rate quantification or process control parameters. Process rate quantification included measurements of colony division rate and growth rate using mesocosm-derived colonies. Process control experiments included testing diatom frustule enhancement of P. pouchetii colony formation from solitary cells, and investigation of mesozooplanktonic suppression and microzooplanktonic enhancement of Phaeocystis globosa colony formation by planktonic grazer infochemicals. The third facet pertained to the molecular identification of genetic differences between single cells and colonies of P. globosa. These studies were designed to provide insight to the question of control factors involved in the transition between single cell and colonial life stages. The life cycle model provided a ready place to incorporate new insights and understanding from empirical studies into an existing model, and can be used to improve simulation models of the direct and indirect effects of Phaeocystis on global biogeochemistry.
20456400|We explore the dynamics of soil organic carbon of various forms and its relation with soil fertility in seeded alfalfa grassland established using a field micro-catchment technique to harvest water on the semiarid Loess Plateau in China. Five regimes were set up: (1) conventional flat cultivation without mulch (CK), (2) ridges and furrows were set up alternately on flat land, with 15 cm between each so that the distance between successive ridges (or successive furrows) was 30 cm, and the ridges were mulched with plastic film (M30), (3) similar to M30, but with twice the distance between furrows and ridges (M60), (4) similar to M30, but the ridges were not mulched (B30), (5) similar to M60, but the ridges were not mulched (B60). The increase in alfalfa forage yield in the mulch regimes promotes soil organic carbon (SOC) content, the light fraction of organic carbon (LFOC), the heavy fraction of organic carbon (HFOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC). MBC was significantly higher in M30 and M60 than in the other regimes. Significant positive correlation is found between MBC and LFOC (R=0.89; P&lt;0.0001), and MBC and HFOC (R=0.82; P=0.00016). At the end of our three-year experiment, the C/N ratio of 10.09 in M60 was significantly (P&lt;0.005) higher than the other regimes. Since a lower C/N ratio accelerates SOC decomposition in this region, the higher C/N ratio in M60 could limit mineralization of soil nitrogen, conserving soil nitrogen and SOC. The lower ratio of nitrate and nitrite nitrogen to total nitrogen, of 10.74, in M60 at the end of this experiment than in the other regimes and before sowing supports this point. The correlations of SOC with available P and with the ratio of available P to total P are positive in the dry year of 2001, but negative in the wet year of 2002. This can be explained on the basis that a high forage yield of alfalfa requires more soil available P in the wet years than in the dry years.
1469216| The purpose of this study was to relate regional variation in litter mass-loss rates (first year) in pine forests to climate across a large, continental-scale area. The variation in mass-loss rate was analyzed using 39 experimental sites spanning climatic regions from the subarctic to subtropical and Mediterranean: the latitudinal gradient ranged from 31 N to 70 N and may represent the the largest geographical area that has ever been sampled and observed for the purpose of studying biogeochemical processes. Because of unified site design and uniform laboratory procedures, data from all sites were directly comparable and permitted a determination of the relative influence of climate versus substrate quality viewed from the perspective of broad regional scales. Simple correlation applied to the entire data set indicated that annual actual evapotranspiration (AET) should be the leading climatic constraint on mass-loss rates (R<sub>adj</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.496). The combination of AET, average July temp. and average annual temp. could explain about 70% of the sites' variability on litter mass-loss. In an analysis of 23 Scots pine sites north of the Alps and Carpatians AET alone could account for about 65% of the variation and the addition of a substrate-quality variable was sufficiently significant to be used in a model. The influence of litter quality was introduced into a model, using data from 11 sites at which litter of different quality had been incubated. These sites are found in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Finland. At any one site most (> 90%) of the variation in mass-loss rates could be explained by one of the litter-quality variables giving concentration of nitrogen, phosphorus or water solubles. However, even when these models included nitrogen or phosphorus even small changes in potential evapotranspiration resulted in large changes in early-phase decay rates. Further regional subdivision of the data set, resulted in a range of strength in the relationship between loss rate and climatic variables, from very weak in Central Europe to strong for the Scandinavian and Atlantic coast sites (R<sub>adj</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.912; AET versus litter mass loss). Much of the variation in observed loss rates could be related to continental versus marine/Atlantic influences. Inland locations had mass-loss rates lower than should be expected on the basis of for example AET alone. Attempts to include seasonality variables were not successful. It is clear that either unknown errors and biases, or, unknown variables are causing these regional differences in response to climatic variables. Nevertheless these results show the powerful influence of climate as a control of the broad-scale geography of mass-loss rates and substrate quality at the stand level. Some of these relationships between mass-loss rate and climatic variables are among the highest ever reported, probably because of the care taken to select uniform sites and experimental methods. This suggest that superior, base line maps of predicted mass-loss rates could be produced using climatic data. These models should be useful to predict the changing equilibrium litter dynamics resulting from climatic change. 
1469769|Understanding of N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes to the atmosphere is complicated by interactions between chemical and physical controls on both production and movement of the gas. To better understand how N<sub>2</sub>O production is controlled in the soil, we measured concentrations of N<sub>2</sub>O and of the proximal controllers on its production in soil water and soil air in a field study in the Rio Icacos basin of the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico. A toposequence (ridge, slope-ridge break, slope, slope-riparian break, riparian, and streambank) was used that has been previously characterized for groundwater chemistry and surface N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes. The proximal controls on N<sub>2</sub>O production include NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, DOC, and O<sub>2</sub>. Nitrous oxide and O<sub>2</sub> were measured in soil air and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, and DO were measured in soil water. Nitrate and DOC disappeared from soil solution at the slope-riparian interface, where soil N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations increased dramatically. Soil N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations continued to increase through the flood plain and the streambank. Nitrous oxide concentrations were highest in soil air probes that had intermediate O<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Changes in N<sub>2</sub>O concentrations in groundwater and soil air in different environments along the catena appear to be controlled by O<sub>2</sub> concentrations. In general, N processing in the unsaturated and saturated zones differs within each topographic position apparently due to differences in redox status.
1468914|We measured the concentrations of reduced sulfur compounds in the atmospheric boundary layer over an equatorial African rain forest. Results obtained from a dirigible hot air balloon and a tethered balloon system in the early morning hours reflect a multilayered structure of the atmospheric boundary layer with gradients of COS and CS<sub>2</sub> indicating an uptake/production of these trace gases by the soil/vegetation system. In addition, we studied emission and deposition fluxes of volatile reduced sulfur compounds from tropical tree species using cuvettes to directly measure the exchange behavior of tree twigs. These cuvettes were operated at young trees in a forest clearing near ground level as well as at a mature tree species on top of the forest canopy, employing a specially designed tree top jungle raft ('Treetop Raft III, Dirigible version') placed on the canopy crown. The results show qualitative and quantitative disparities between different tree species as well as between individuals of the same species near ground level (young) and at the top of the canopy (mature). We found some correlations between photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation and emission of sulfur compounds. Comparison between measurements at the ground and at the canopy top show that the studied tree species adapts its photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation in response to the climatic conditions at the canopy top. This is accompanied by a quantitative change in trace gas emission. Lower CO<sub>2</sub> fixation rates are accompanied by an increase in the emission of reduced sulfur compounds. We propose the increase of DMS emission at the canopy top to be explained by a potential demand of nitrogen in the foliage resulting in an accumulation of sulfur.
20456544|Well-constrained carbon:nitrogen:phosphorus (C:N:P) ratios in planktonic biomass, and their importance in advancing our understanding of biological processes and nutrient cycling in marine ecosystems, has motivated ecologists to search for similar patterns in terrestrial ecosystems. Recent analyses indicate the existence of "Redfield-like" ratios in plants, and such data may provide insight into the nature of nutrient limitation in terrestrial ecosystems. We searched for analogous patterns in the soil and the soil microbial biomass by conducting a review of the literature. Although soil is characterized by high biological diversity, structural complexity and spatial heterogeneity, we found remarkably consistent C:N:P ratios in both total soil pools and the soil microbial biomass. Our analysis indicates that, similar to marine phytoplankton, element concentrations of individual phylogenetic groups within the soil microbial community may vary, but on average, atomic C:N:P ratios in both the soil (186:13:1) and the soil microbial biomass (60:7:1) are well-constrained at the global scale. We did see significant variation in soil and microbial element ratios between vegetation types (i.e., forest versus grassland), but in most cases, the similarities in soil and microbial element ratios among sites and across large scales were more apparent than the differences. Consistent microbial biomass element ratios, combined with data linking specific patterns of microbial element stoichiometry with direct evidence of microbial nutrient limitation, suggest that measuring the proportions of C, N and P in the microbial biomass may represent another useful tool for assessing nutrient limitation of ecosystem processes in terrestrial ecosystems.
1469645|We investigated the relationship between plant nitrogen limitation and water availability in dryland ecosystems. We tested the hypothesis that at lower levels of annual precipitation, aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) is limited primarily by water whereas at higher levels of precipitation, it is limited primarily by nitrogen. Using a literature survey of fertilization experiments in arid, semi-arid, and subhumid ecosystems, we investigated the response of ANPP to nitrogen addition as a function of variation in precipitation across geographic gradients, as well as across year-to-year variation in precipitation within sites. We used four different indices to assess the degree of N limitation: (1) Absolute Increase of plant production in response to fertilization (the slope of ANPP vs. amount of added N at different levels of annual precipitation); (2) Relative Response (the percent increase in fertilized over control ANPP at different levels of N addition); (3) Fertilizer Use Efficiency (FUE, the absolute gain in productivity per amount of fertilizer N), and (4) Maximum Response (the greatest absolute increase in ANPP at saturating levels of N addition). Relative Response to fertilization did not significantly increase with increasing precipitation either across the geographic gradient or across year-to-year variation within sites. Nor did the Maximum Response to fertilization increase with increasing precipitation across the geographic gradient. On the other hand, there was a significant increase in the Absolute Increase and FUE indices with both geographical and temporal variation in precipitation. Together, these results indicate that there is not necessarily a shift of primary limitation from water to N across the geographic water availability gradient. Instead, our results support the hypothesis of co-limitation. The apparently contradictory results from the four indices of N limitation can best be explained by an integration of plant ecophysiological, community, and ecosystem mechanisms whereby plants are co-limited by multiple resources, species shifts occur in response to changing resource levels, and nitrogen and water availability are tightly linked through biogeochemical feedbacks.
20519787|Flocculent materials (floc), in aquatic systems usually consist of a non-consolidated layer of biogenic, detrital material relatively rich in organic matter which represents an important food-web component for invertebrates and fish. Thus, variations in its composition could impact food webs and change faunal structure. Transport, remineralization rates and deposition of floc may also be important factors in soil/sediment formation. In spite of its relevance and sensitivity to external factors, few chemical studies have been carried out on the biogeochemistry of floc material. In this study, we focused on the molecular characterization of the flocculent organic matter (OM), the assessment of its origin and its environmental fate at five stations along a freshwater to marine ecotone, namely the Taylor Slough, Everglades National Park (ENP), Florida. To tackle this issue, suspended, unconsolidated, detrital floc samples, soils/sediments and plants were analyzed for bulk properties, biomarkers and pigments. Both geochemical proxies and biomass-specific biomarkers were used to assess OM sources and transformations. Our results show that the detrital organic matter of the flocculent material is largely regulated by local vegetation inputs, ranging from periphyton, emergent and submerged plants and terrestrial plants such as mangroves, with molecular evidence of different degrees of diagenetic reworking, including fungal activity. Evidence is presented for both hydrodynamic transport of floc materials, and incorporation of floc OM into soils/sediments. However, some molecular parameters showed a decoupling between floc and underlying soil/sediment OM, suggesting that physical transport, incorporation and degradation/remineralization of OM in floc may be controlled by a combination of a variety of complex biogeochemical variables including hydrodynamic transport, hydroperiod characteristics, primary productivity, nutrient availability, and OM quality among others. Further investigations are needed to better understand the ecological role of floc in freshwater and coastal wetlands.
1468859| Most of the small external inputs of N to the Shortgrass steppe appear to be conserved. One pathway of loss is the emission of nitrous oxide, which we estimate to account for 2.5-9.0% of annual wet deposition inputs of N. These estimates were determined from an N<sub>2</sub>O emission model based on field data which describe the temporal variability of N<sub>2</sub>O produced from nitrification and denitrification from two slope positions. Soil water and temperature models were used to translate records of air temperature and precipitation between 1950 and 1984 into variables appropriate to drive the gas flux model, and annual N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes were estimated for that period. The mean annual fluxes were 80 g N ha<sup>-1</sup> for a midslope location and 160 g N ha<sup>-1</sup> for a swale. Fluxes were higher in wet years than in dry, ranging from 73 to 100 g N ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> at the midslope, but the variability was not high. N<sub>2</sub>O fluxes were also estimated from cattle urine patches and these fluxes while high within a urine patch, did not contribute significantly to a regional budget. Laboratory experiments using C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> to inhibit nitrifiers suggested that 60-80% of N<sub>2</sub>O was produced as a result of nitrification, with denitrification being less important, in contrast to our earlier findings to the contrary. Intrasite and intraseasonal variations in N<sub>2</sub>O flux were coupled to variations in mineral N dynamics, with high rates of N<sub>2</sub>O flux occurring with high rates of inorganic N turnover. We computed a mean flux of 104 g N ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> from the shortgrass landscape, and a flux of 2.6  109 g N y<sup>-1</sup> from all shortgrass steppe (25  106 ha). 
1469387|Lake Kinneret (Israel) has undergone several prominent chemical and biological changes since 1970. Between 1970 and 1991 significant, long-term gradual increase were recorded in epilimnetic dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations (about 20%), and in pH levels (0.2 units). Concomitantly there was a significant increase in hypolimnetic H<sub>2</sub>S concentrations (about 75%) and a long-term gradual drop in zooplankton biomass (50%). Since 1994 these trends were reversed and the levels of the three chemical parameters have returned to those found in the 1970's and that of zooplankton to mid 1980's levels. The present study is an attempt to relate some of these long term changes by means of yearly oxygen budgets, based on fluxes of oxygen producing and consuming processes. This analysis raises the possibility that part of the long-term increase in epilimnetic DO and pH between 1970 to 1990 may be attributed to reduced inputs of organic matter from alochthonous sources and possibly to enhanced burial of organic matter in the bed sediments. However, the major cause for the observed increase in epilimnetic DO and pH is increased sedimentation of organic matter to the hypolimnion during stratification. As indicated by the amount of H<sub>2</sub>S formed in the hypolimnion during stratification added to the amount of oxygen entrapped in this layer at the onset of thermal stratification, between 1970 to 1991 the sedimentation flux of organic matter increased by approximately 40%. It is estimated that during these two decades hypolimnetic respiration increased from ca. 8% of the annual amount of oxygen evolved due to photosynthesis during the early 1970's to ca. 12.5% during the 1980's. The shift in the layer of oxidative processes is suggested to be the result of a multi-annual decline in zooplankton grazing pressure, which led to increased sedimentation of organic matter. The reversed trends for DO, pH and H<sub>2</sub>S since 1994 may have partially been due to the increase in zooplankton activity and partially due to changes in phytoplankton community structure.
1469946|In the present study we characterized the buffering system including aluminum in the organic surface horizon (O) of field experiments with replicated plots of pure Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) and replicated plots of spruce with a birch (Betula pendula Roth and B. pubescens Ehrh.) admixture. Our results show that a change in tree species composition may have a rather large, short-term (12 years) effect on the concentration of organically bound aluminum in the humus layer (H) of the O horizon. The pure spruce plots had a significantly higher concentration of exchangeable aluminum (Al<sub>e</sub>) and organically bound (pyrophosphate extractable) aluminum (Al<sub>p</sub>) in the H layer and a lower concentration of each base cation. Furthermore, our results confirm earlier findings that aluminum has base cation properties in acidic organic horizons. Thus, the change in tree species composition did not affect the pH in spite of a change in base saturation, because base cations were mainly compensated for by aluminum. The change in organically bound aluminum was accompanied by a similar change in organically bound pyrophosphate extractable iron (Fe<sub>p</sub>). The observed differences between the mixed and pure spruce plots in the amounts of Al<sub>p</sub> and Fe<sub>p</sub> in the H layer could not be explained by estimated differences in biocycling of Al and Fe either by above-ground litterfall or by root turnover.
1468711|Increased emissions of nitrogen compounds to the atmosphere by human activities have been well documented. However, in order to better quantify these anthropogenic emissions, better knowledge of natural emissions rates must be known. In addition, variation in natural emissions through time should be documented. In this note we present data collected and/or analyzed by us for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in recent snow from remote regions of the world. We also summarize existing data sets from other remote regions. This is done to establish a better understanding of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> deposition rates in these regions as well as to add more information to our global understanding of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> deposition.
1469542| Methane emissions were measured over a 17-month interval at 21 locations on the Orinoco fringing floodplain and upper delta (total area, 14,000 km<sup>2</sup>). Emissions totaled 0.17 Tg yr<sup>-1</sup>, or 7.1 mmol d<sup>-1</sup> (114 mg d<sup>-1</sup>; standard deviation, 18%) per m<sup>2</sup> of water surface. Ebullition accounted for 65% of emissions. Emission rates were about five times as high for floodplain forest as for open water or macrophyte mats. Emission rates were positively correlated with carbon content of sediment and amount of methane in the water column, and negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen, but the correlations were weak. Emission from floodplain soils occurred only when the water content of soil exceeded 25%, which occurred within 20 m of standing water during floodplain drainage (3 months/yr). Bare soils emitted 60 mmol/day per m of shoreline length; soils covered by stranded macrophyte beds emitted five times this amount. Total emissions were accounted for primarily by flooded forest (94%); macrophyte mats, open water, and exposed soils made only small contributions. The flux-weighted mean  <sup>13</sup>C for the floodplain was -62  8; for D the mean was -271  27. The  <sup>13</sup>C and D were negatively correlated. Overall emission rates were notably lower than for the Amazon. The depth and duration of flooding are considerably less for the Orinoco than for the Amazon floodplain; oxygen over sediments is the rule for the Orinoco but not for the Amazon. The Orinoco data illustrate the difficulty of generalizing emission rates. Current information for tropical America, including revised estimates for inundated area along the Amazon, indicate that methane emissions from tropical floodplains have been overestimated. 
24715144|The Adirondack region of New York has been identified as a hot spot where high methylmercury concentrations are found in surface waters and biota, yet mercury (Hg) concentrations vary widely in this region. We collected stream and groundwater samples for Hg and organic carbon analyses across the upper Hudson River, a 493 km basin in the central Adirondacks to evaluate and model the sources of variation in filtered total Hg (FTHg) concentrations. Variability in FTHg concentrations during the growing seasons (MayOct) of 20072009 in Fishing Brook, a 66-km sub-basin, was better explained by specific ultra-violet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA), a measure of organic carbon aromaticity, than by dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, a commonly used Hg indicator. SUVA was a stronger predictor of FTHg concentrations during the growing season than during the dormant season. Multiple linear regression models that included SUVA values and DOC concentrations could explain 75 % of the variation in FTHg concentrations on an annual basis and 84 % during the growing season. A multiple linear regression landscape modeling approach applied to 27 synoptic sites across the upper Hudson basin found that higher SUVA values are associated with gentler slopes, and greater riparian area, and lower SUVA values are associated with an increasing influence of open water. We hypothesize that the strong HgSUVA relation in this basin reflects distinct patterns of FTHg and SUVA that are characteristic of source areas that control the mobilization of Hg to surface waters, and that the seasonal influence of these source areas varies in this heterogeneous basin landscape.
41490470|Mercury distribution and partitioning was studied in the River Idrijca system, draining the area of the former Idrija mercury mine, Slovenia. Mercury dynamics were assessed by speciation analysis of mercury in water and river bed sediment samples during a 2-year study at locations on the River Idrijca and its major tributaries. Simultaneously, the influence of some major physico-chemical parameters that influence the fate of mercury in the aquatic environment was investigated. The distribution of mercury species in the River Idrijca catchment indicated contamination from mine tailings distributed in the town of Idrija and erosion of contaminated soils. The partitioning between dissolved and particulate mercury phases in river water was found to be mostly controlled by the variable content of suspended solids resulting from changing hydrological conditions and complexation with various ligands present in river water, among which dissolved organic carbon (DOC) seems to be the most important. Overall results indicate that mercury is transported downstream from the mining area mainly as finely suspended material including colloids rather than in the dissolved phase. This riverine transport occurs mostly during short, but extreme hydro-meteorological conditions when remobilization of mercury from the river bed sediments occurs. A significant part of the mercury particulate phase in water corresponds to cinnabar particles. During its transport, important Hg transformation mechanisms that increase the risk of mercury uptake by biota take place, evidenced by the increase in the relative contribution of reactive mercury (Hg R ), dissolved gaseous mercury (DGM) and monomethylmercury (MeHg) downstream from the Idrija mine. However, our data revealed relatively low methylation efficiency in this contaminated river system. We attribute this to the site specific physico-chemical conditions responsible for making inorganic mercury unavailable and limiting the capacity of methylating bacteria.
1469985| Concentrations of Al, Fe, Mn, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn were measured in the reference and treatment basins of Little Rock Lake (Vilas County, Wisconsin), a low-alkalinity, seepage system (pH 6.1, alkalinity 25 eq/L) during six years of a whole-basin acidification and the first four years of the lake's recovery. The treatment basin was acidified with H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> in three two-year steps to pH 5.6, 5.1, and 4.7. By the end of year 4 of recovery, treatment basin pH increased to 5.3 as a result of internal alkalinity generation. During acidification, dissolved Mn and Fe (0.4 m pore-size filters) increased at pH 5.6; dissolved Al, Cd, and Zn became elevated at pH 5.1; and dissolved Pb at pH 4.7. Dissolved Cu remained similar in both basins to pH 4.7. Al, Fe and Mn levels declined significantly during the recovery period, approaching values at pH 5.3 intermediate between the concentrations at pH 5.6 and 5.1 during acidification. Dissolved Al and Fe in the reference basin were near the equilibrium levels for solubility of gibbsite (Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>) and amorphous Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub> (s). The acidified basin was undersaturated relative to gibbsite, and dissolved Al was limited by pH disequilibrium between the water column and sediments and possibly by Al-DOC precipitation. Dissolved Fe apparently was controlled by solubility of amorphous Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub> (s) and Fe-DOC precipitation. Dissolved Mn levels in both basins were consistent with manganite [-MnOOH(s)] solubility. Elevated levels of Cd, Pb, and Zn in the treatment basin during acidification probably resulted from less efficient scavenging of atmospherically-deposited Cd, Pb, and Zn by settling particles. 
1469489|Ecosystems with high rates of nitrogen fixation often have high loss rates through leaching or possibly denitrification. However, there is no formal theoretical context to examine why this should be the case nor of how nitrogen accumulates in such open systems. Here, we propose a simple model coupling nitrogen inputs and losses to carbon inputs and losses. The nitrogen balance of this model system depends on plant (nitrogen fixer) growth rate, its carrying capacity, N fixed/C fixed, residence time of nitrogen and carbon in biomass, litter decay rate, litter N/C, and fractional loss rate of mineralized nitrogen. The model predicts the requirements for equilibrium in a nitrogen-fixing system, and the conditions on nitrogen fixation and losses in order for the system to accumulate nitrogen and carbon. In particular, the accumulation of nitrogen and carbon in a nitrogen-fixing system depend on an interaction between residence time in vegetation and litter decay rate in soil. To reflect a possible increased uptake of soil nitrogen and decreased respiratory cost of symbiotic nitrogen fixers, the model was then modified so that fixation rate decreased and growth rate increased as nitrogen capital accumulated. These modifications had only small effects on carbon and nitrogen accumulation. This suggests that switching from uptake of atmospheric nitrogen to mineral soil nitrogen as nitrogen capital accumulates simply results in a trade-off between energetic limitations and soil nitrogen limitations to carbon and nitrogen accumulation. Experimental tests of the model are suggested.
1469855| Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the waters from Lake Biwa, Japan was fractionated using tangential flow ultrafiltration, and subsequently characterized by fluorescence properties and amino acids. While major dissolved organic carbon (DOC), UV absorbance (Abs), humic-like fluorescence (Flu) and total hydrolyzed amino acids (THAA) occurred in the less than 5 kDa molecular size fraction, they were not evenly distributed among various molecular size fractions. Flu/Abs ratios increased, and THAA/DOC ratios decreased with decreasing molecular size. Humic-like fluorescence occurred in all molecular size fractions, but protein-like fluorescence only occurred in the 0.1 m-GF/F fraction. Subtle differences in amino acid compositions (both individuals and functional groups) were observed between various molecular size fractions, this may indicate the occurrence of DOM degradation from higher to lower molecular weight. The results reported here have significance for further understanding the sources and nature of DOM in aquatic environments. 
20055264|Proteinaceous components from four Washington coast margin sediments were extracted with base, fractionated into one of four size classes (&lt 3 kDa, 3-10 kDa, 10-100 kDa, &gt 100 kDa), and analyzed for their amino acid contents. Base-extracted material accounts for 30% of the total hydrolyzable amino acids (THAA) and each size fraction has a unique composition, regardless of where the sediment was collected (shelf or upper slope). The &lt 3 kDa size fraction (10% of base-extractable THAA) is relatively enriched in glycine (30 mol%), lysine (5 mol%), and non-protein amino acids (5 mol%). Glycine and non-protein amino acids are common degradation products, and lysine is very surface active. We suggest that the &lt 3 kDa size fraction, therefore, represents a diagenetic mixture of fragments produced during the degradation of larger proteins. The 3-10 and 10-100 kDa size fractions (10% and 42% of base-extractable THAA, respectively) have similar amino acid distributions dominated by aspartic acid ( 30 mol%). Enrichments in Asp is likely due to both preservation of Asp-rich proteins and the production of Asp during degradation. The &gt 100 kDa size fraction (38% of base-extractable THAA) is not dominated by any particular amino acid and can not be modeled by mixing the amino acid compositions of the other size fractions. We propose that the larger size fractions (10-100 kDa and &gt 100 kDa) represent intact, or near intact, proteins. Estimates of isoelectric points and relative hydrophobicity suggest the base-extractable proteins are primarily acidic and have globular structures. Statistical comparisons to several known proteins indicates that the base-extractable component is most similar to planktonic cytoplasmic proteins.
24715182|Bark beetle populations have drastically increased in magnitude over the last several decades leading to the largest-scale tree mortality ever recorded from an insect infestation on multiple wooded continents. When the trees die, the loss of canopy and changes in water and nutrient uptake lead to observable changes in hydrology and biogeochemical cycling. This review aims to synthesize the current research on the effects of the bark beetle epidemic on nutrient cycling and water quality while integrating recent and relevant hydrological findings, along with suggesting necessary future research avenues. Studies generally agree that snow depth will increase in infested forests, though the magnitude is uncertain. Changes in evapotranspiration are more variable as decreased transpiration from tree death may be offset by increased understory evapotranspiration and ground evaporation. As a result of such competing hydrologic processes that can affect watershed biogeochemistry along with the inherent variability of natural watershed characteristics, water quality changes related to beetle infestation are difficult to predict and may be regionally distinct. However, tree-scale changes to soilwater chemistry (N, P, DOC and base cation concentrations and composition) are being observed in association with beetle outbreaks which ultimately could lead to larger-scale responses. The different temporal and spatial patterns of bark beetle infestations due to different beetle and tree species lead to inconsistent infestation impacts. Climatic variations and largescale watershed responses provide a further challenge for predictions due to spatial heterogeneities within a single watershed; conflicting reports from different regions suggest that hydrologic and water quality impacts of the beetle on watersheds cannot be generalized. Research regarding the subsurface water and chemical flow-paths and residence times after a bark beetle epidemic is lacking and needs to be rigorously addressed to best predict watershed or regional-scale changes to soilwater, groundwater, and stream water chemistry.
1468676| In sediment slurry experiments with anoxic marine sediments collected in Cape Lookout Bight, NC, and a site in mid-Chesapeake Bay, the rates of sulfate reduction and ammonium production decrease with increasing dilution of sediment with oxygen-free seawater. The effect of sediment dilution on the rates of these processes can be described by a simple mathematical relationship, and when these rates are corrected for sediment dilution they yield values which agree well with direct measurements of these processes. In sediment slurry studies of amino acid utilization in Cape Lookout Bight sediments, the fermentative decarboxylation of glutamic acid (to -aminobutyric acid) or aspartic acid (to alanine or -alanine) did not occur when either of these amino acids were added to Cape Lookout Bight slurries. The addition of glutamic acid did however lead to a small ( 1%) transient build-up of -aminoglutaric acid. Measured rates of glutamic acid uptake in these slurries also decreased with increasing sediment dilution. Molybdate inhibition experiments demonstrated that dissolved free amino acids represent 1-3% of the carbon sources/electron donors used for sulfate reduction in Cape Lookout Bight sediments. The direct oxidation of amino acids by sulfate reducing bacteria also accounts for 13-20% of the total ammonium produced. Glutamic acid, alanine, -aminoglutaric acid, aspartic acid and asparagine are the major amino acids oxidized by sulfate reducing bacteria in Cape Lookout Bight sediments. 
41490440|Spring snowmelt in the arctic and boreal regions represents the most significant event in the hydrological year. We measured concentrations and fluxes of different carbon species in 2 small contrasting (control v drained) forested peatland catchments in E. Finland between April and June 2008 and compared these to long-term annual fluxes. Measurements were made using a combination of continuous sensors (CO, temperature, pH, discharge) and routine spot sampling (DOC, POC, DIC, CO, CH, NO). The highest concentrations under low flow conditions before the spring flood event, reflecting accumulation and downstream release of gaseous C at the end of the winter period. Over the length of the study mean CH concentrations were 10 higher in the drained site. The snowmelt event was associated with a dilution of DOC and CO, with the drained catchment showing a much flashier hydrological response compared to the control site, and post-event, a slower recovery in DOC and CO concentrations. Fluxes of all carbon species during the snowmelt event were significant and represented 3745% of the annual flux. This highlights the challenge of quantifying aquatic C fluxes in areas with large temporal variability and suggests that inability to "capture" the spring snowmelt event may lead to under-estimation of C fluxes in northern regions.
24715194|Dissolved total nitrogen (Nt) and total organic carbon (TOC) exports were measured from 30 catchments and regions draining 76 % of the Canadian landscape in order to estimate reactive N and organic C runoff losses to estuaries and the conditions that control them. N exports from the catchments were lower than measured in most of Europe and the United States due to significantly less agricultural activity and atmospheric deposition, especially in northern Canada. We produce statistical models using a number of geographical, climatic, agricultural, and population factors in order to predict N and C losses from the remaining regions. Using measured and extrapolated data, we estimated that the Canadian landscape exports 884 and 18,210 ktons of Nt and OC per year. Area normalized exports ranged from 29.4 kg km for the northern Mackenzie River to 299 kg km for the semi-agricultural Saint John. Area normalized OC exports ranged from 495 kg km in the high Arctic to 7,295 to the wetland dominated Broadback River in northern Quebec. N exports were best predicted by the latitude of the catchment centroid, mean slope, population density, runoff and % of the catchment as agricultural land. The best model for predicting TOC exports needed only slope and runoff. The Nt/OC ratio in the rivers unsurprisingly was highest in the southern portion of the country where anthropogenic activities were concentrated.
1469065|Fluxes and stores of SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> were measured in a small Canadian Shield basin during the 1989 snowmelt. Sulphate flux from the unsaturated zone (14.1 7.3 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) was four times the amount supplied in meltwater and precipitation (3.5 0.4 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>). This reflects flushing of soluble SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> from organic and upper mineral soil horizons during melt, which counteracted potential dilution of groundwater SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> levels by large water inputs to the basin. 35.6 12.4 kg SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> entered the saturated zone during melt, supplied equally by leaching from overlying soils and conversion of the capillary fringe to phreatic water due to rising water table levels. Streamflow conveyed 70% of the total SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> export of 10.1 2.3 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>, and was largely supplied by groundwater discharge from a wetland in the lower portion of the basin. The remaining 30% of total export was via shallow subsurface flow. Results highlight the importance of unsaturated and saturated zone processes for SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> dynamics and export during snowmelt.
1469326| The accumulation of methylmercury (MeHg) to an oligochaete worm Lumbriculus variegatus (Mller) was measured in two different lake sediments in the laboratory. <sup>14</sup>C- labelled MeHg was added to sediments at the nominal concentration of 95 ng/g dw sediment. Groups of six oligochaete worms were exposed in glass beakers to 35 g of spiked sediment for 14 days. The two sediments had organic carbon concentrations of 3.4% and 9.9% and natural selenium concentrations of 1.45 and 0.28 mg/kg (dw), respectively. After two weeks exposure, both the accumulation rate of MeHg and the body residue in the worms were much lower in the sediment having a high organic carbon content. The effect of selenium concentration in the sediment on bioaccumulation of MeHg in Lumbriculus variegatus was measured in one sediment (organic carbon 3.4% and Se 1.45 mg/kg) by adding sodiumselenite (Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub>) at different concentrations. The added amounts of selenium were 0, 0.1, 0.5, 2.5, 15.0, and 50.0 mg Se/kg dry sediment. In this exposure the nominal concentration of MeHg was 102 ng/g dw sediment. The two lowest selenium concentrations did not affect the bioaccumulation of MeHg. But, the dose of 2.5 mg Se/kg resulted in a 25% reduction in the body residue after two weeks exposure. When 15 and 50 mg Se/kg were added to the sediment the accumulation of MeHg in the organisms was decreased by 75% and 86%, respectively, as compared to the reference. 
24716796|The viral mediated transformation of phytoplankton organic carbon to dissolved forms ("viral shunt") has been suggested as a major source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in marine systems. Despite the potential implications of viral activity on the global carbon fluxes, studies investigating changes in the DOC composition from viral lysis is still lacking. Micromonas pusilla is an ecologically relevant picoeukaryotic phytoplankter, widely distributed in both coastal and oceanic marine waters. Viruses have been found to play a key role in regulating the population dynamics of this species. In this study we used axenic cultures of exponentially growing M. pusilla to determine the impact of viral lysis on the DOC concentration and composition, as estimated from lysate-derived production of transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) and two fractions of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (DOM): aromatic amino acids (excitation/emission; 280/320 nm; F(280/320)) and marine humic-like fluorescent DOM (320/410 nm; F(320/410)). DOC concentration increased 4.5 times faster and reached 2.6 times higher end concentration in the viral infected compared with the non-infected cultures. The production of F(280/320) and F(320/410) were 4.1 and 2.8 times higher in the infected cultures, and the elevated ratio between F(280/320) and F(320/410) in lysates suggested a higher contribution of labile (protein) components in viral produced DOM than in algal exudates. The TEP production was 1.8 times faster and reached a 1.5 times higher level in the viral infected M. pusilla culture compared with the non- infected cultures. The measured increase in both DOC and TEP concentrations suggests that viral lysis has multiple and opposite implications for the production and export processes in the pelagic ocean: (1) by releasing host biomass as DOC it decreases the organic matter sedimentation and promotes respiration and nutrient retention in the photic zone, whereas (2) the observed enhanced TEP production could stimulate particle aggregation and thus carbon export out of the photic zone.
20456431|We monitored the stable nitrogen isotopic composition (N) of suspended matter and ammonium in the freshwater stretch of the Scheldt estuary (Belgium) over a full year to investigate for seasonal evolution and possible co-variation between isotopic signatures. The N value of ammonium remained rather constant during winter (average = +11.4) but increased significantly with the spring and summer bloom, reaching values as high as +70. This enrichment of the ammonium pool in N coincided with significant ammonium depletion during summer period, suggesting a close causal relationship. Based on a semi-closed system approach we deduced an apparent fractionation factor associated with <tex-math>$\text{NH}_{4}^{+}$</tex-math> utilization (i.e. combining effects of uptake and nitrification) of 18.4 (SE = 2.0), which is similar to values reported in literature. Observed variations of ammonium N could account for about 69% of N variation in suspended matter.
41490534|Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is an important component of the C cycle in forest ecosystems, but dynamics and origin of DOC in throughfall and soil solution are yet poorly understood. In a 2-year study, we analyzed the radiocarbon signature of DOC in throughfall and soil solution beneath the Oa horizon and at 90 cm depth in a Norway spruce forest on a Podzol soil. A two-pool mixing model revealed that throughfall DOC comprised mainly biogenic C, i.e. recently fixed C, from canopy leaching and possibly other sources. The contribution of fossil DOC from atmospheric deposition to throughfall DOC was on average 6% with maxima of 8-11% during the dormant season. In soil solution from the Oa horizon, DO C signature was highly dynamic (range from  8% o to + 103% o), but not correlated with DOC concentration. Radiocarbon signatures suggest that DOC beneath the Oa horizon originated mainly from occluded and mineral associated organic matter fractions of the Oa horizon rather than from the Oi or Oe horizon. Relatively old C was released in the rewetting phase following a drought period in the late summer of 2006. In contrast, the DOC signature indicated the release of younger C throughout the humid year 2007. In soil solutions from 90 cm depth, DOC signatures were also highly dynamic (127%o to + 3%o) despite constantly low DOC concentrations. Similar to the Oa horizon, the lowest DOC signature at 90 cm depth was found after the rewetting phase in the late summer of 2006. Because of the variation in the DOC signatures at this depth, we conclude that DOC was not equilibrated with the surrounding soil, but also originated from overlaying soil horizons. The dynamics of DOC in throughfall and soil solution suggest that the sources of DOC are highly variable in time. Extended drought periods likely have a strong influence on release and translocation of DOC from relatively old and possibly stabilized soil organic matter fractions. Temporal variations as well as the input of fossil DOC needs to be considered when calibrating DOC models based on DOC signatures.
1469905|In the present paper we report partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> (pCO<sub>2</sub>) data obtained off the Belgian coast during 24 cruises. The temporal and spatial resolution of this data set allows us to discuss satisfactorily seasonal and inter-annual variability of pCO<sub>2</sub> in the study area. The dynamics of pCO<sub>2</sub> are described using two approaches: fixed reference stations and area survey cruises. The air-water fluxes of CO<sub>2</sub> in the Scheldt estuarine plume and in the outer-plume region are estimated quantitatively, showing that these areas correspond respectively to a net annual source and sink of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. The annually integrated air-water fluxes for the Scheldt estuarine plume range between +1.1 and +1.9 mol m<sup>-2</sup> year<sup>-1</sup> as a function of the formulation of the exchange coefficient of CO<sub>2</sub>. The annual net emission of CO<sub>2</sub> from the estuarine plume to the atmosphere is estimated to be between +2.3 to +4.0 Gmol year<sup>-1</sup> which represents 17 to 29% of the estimate reported in the literature for the Scheldt inner estuary.
24715119|The Cefas SmartBuoy network provides a unique insight into the biogeochemical dynamics of the Northern European shelf seas, particularly the North Sea, through high-resolution automated offshore water sampling. We present total dissolved nitrogen and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) from the Dowsing SmartBuoy site (53.531 N, 1.053 E) from January to October 2010, the first high resolution seasonal (winter-autumn) cycle of DON from the open North Sea. On top of a refractory background DON concentration of approximately 5 M, a rapid increase in DON of a further 5 M is observed over the course of the spring bloom. This rapidly produced DON declines at an estimated net decay rate of between 0.6 and 1.8 M Month. The slow decay suggests that the majority of the additional DON produced during the spring bloom is of semi-labile nature and has a lifetime of weeks to months. The dataset allows us to tightly constrain the budget for water column nitrogen over the winter, spring and summer of 2010 and clearly demonstrates the 'sawtooth' nature of the seasonal cycle of DON in the open North Sea, which has been impossible to resolve with a more traditional ship-based mode of operation. This work highlights the importance of autonomous sampling approaches in better understanding shelf sea biogeochemistry in the future.
1468710|Estimates of sediment entrainment are required for models of particle transport in lakes and estuaries but are difficult to make because of the multiplicity of factors affecting cohesiveness of surficial sediments. We present results of sediment resuspension studies performed in an annular flume calibrated with laser-Doppler velocimetry. In our experiments, using sediments collected from two sites in the R. Raisin which flows into L. Erie and from one site in the western basin of L. Erie near the mouth of the R. Raisin, we applied shear stresses at the sediment-water interface in steps from 2 to 12 dyne/cm<sup>2</sup>. Percent water content at the surface of the sediments was either 77 or 74%, and trials were run with and without oxygenating the water overlying the sediments. Entrainment rates as a function of shear stress at the sediment-water interface were best described by a power-law relationship. All but 14% of the variability in the power law expression was due to shear stress and percent water content; the variability not accounted for was due to differences in particle size distributions, chemical properties, and biological activity in the sediments.
1469123|This study combines an analysis of porewater chemistry with new, solid phase wet chemical extractions to examine the seasonal cycling of Fe in vegetated and unvegetated (cyanobacterial mat) saltmarsh sediments. Saltmarsh sediments are shown to contain more solid phase reactive Fe than other marine sediments studied so far. From the partitioning and speciation of solid Fe, and solid/soluble reduced S analysis in 10 sediment cores, we have observed that a majority of solid Fe in these sediments is cycled rapidly and completely between oxidized reactive Fe and reduced Fe as pyrite. Vegetated porewaters showed a lower pH and much higher Fe(II) concentrations on average than unvegetated porewaters in the top 10 cm, whereas sulfate, alkalinity, and sulfide concentrations were similar in the two environments. The amorphous Fe(III) oxide fraction showed a high negative correlation to solid and soluble reduced S (r<sup>2</sup>=-0.86 and -0.71, respectively) in surface vegetated sediments whereas the crystalline Fe(III) oxide fraction showed a high negative correlation (r<sup>2</sup>=-0.96) to sulfide only at depth. Though reactive Fe was observed in unvegetated sediments, no seasonal trend was apparent and the speciation of solid Fe revealed that most of it was reduced. Solid phase and porewater chemistry support the dominant role of the biota (Spartina alterniflora and bacteria) in controlling the reactivity of Fe and suggest that the current definition of solid phase, reactive Fe should be expanded to include crystalline Fe(III) minerals which are available for pyrite formation in saltmarsh sediments. In support of previous saltmarsh studies, we present evidence that the redox cycle of solid Fe is controlled by sulfate reduction and sediment oxidation which respond to both annual cycles (light, temperature) and to short-term, episodic effects such as weather and tides.
4151496|A better understanding of nitrate removal mechanisms is important for managing the water quality function of stream riparian zones. We examined the linkages between hydrologic flow paths, patterns of electron donors and acceptors and the importance of denitrification as a nitrate removal mechanism in eight riparian zones on glacial till and outwash landscapes in southern Ontario, Canada. Nitrate-N concentrations in shallow groundwater from adjacent cropland declined from levels that were often
20519880|Forest clear-cutting followed by soil preparation means disturbance for soil microorganisms and disruption of N and C cycles. We measured fluxes of NO and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in upland soil (podzol) and adjacent peat within a clear-cut forest catchment. Both soil types behaved in a similar way, showing net uptake of NO in the first year after the clear-cutting, and turning to net release in the second. The NO flux dynamics were similar to those of N content in logging residues, as reported from a nearby site. As organic matter is used in the food web of the decomposers, we attempted to explain the dynamics of NO uptake and release by measuring the concurrent dynamics of the low molecular weight (LMW) fraction and the aromaticity of DOC in a soil solution. The labile and most readily available LMW fractions of DOC were nearly absent in the year following the clear-cutting, but rose after two years. The more refractory high molecular weight (HMW) fraction of DOC decreased two years after the clear-cutting. The first year's net uptake of NO could be accounted for by the growth of decomposer biomass in the logging residues and detritus from the degenerating ground vegetation, resulting in immobilization of nitrogen. Simultaneously, the labile, LMW fraction of DOC became almost completely exhausted. The low availability of the LMW fraction could retard the growth and cause the accumulated decomposer biomass to collapse. During the following winter and summer the fraction of LMW clearly increased, followed by increased NO emissions. The presence of LMW DOC fractions, not the concentration of DOC, seems to be an important controller for NO liberation after a major disturbance such as clear-cutting and site preparation. The complex connection between DOC characteristics, nitrification or denitrification merits further studies.
