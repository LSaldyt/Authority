10.2307/3298531|Tropical island ecosystems appear to be especially vulnerable to invasive species as indicated by the often high numbers and percentages of exotic species on oceanic and continental islands. Here I reexamine hypotheses offered to account for the apparently high invasibility of tropical islands and suggest a simple synthesis based on resource availability, propagule supply, and relative competitive abilities of exotic and island species. This review suggests that fundamentally two interacting processes-high net resource availability and poor ability of native species to preempt those resources-make island communities vulnerable to the establishment and spread of alien species. In addition, historically high rates of introduction have provided opportunity in the form of a diverse and abundant propagule rain of exotic species. The combination produces a scenario that is not an optimistic one for island ecosystems. It suggests that these native ecosystems on islands are particularly vulnerable to naturalizing exotics growing on their borders, and that while disturbance from a variety of causes, including pigs, fire, grazing, and natural dieback of the canopy dominants, increases the opportunities for exotic incursions, even intact forests are not immune. Unless these forests are aggressively managed and alien propagule pressure reduced, they will be highly modified by expanding exotic plant populations. Tropical islands are an effective early warning system of the impacts that successive waves of exotic species invasions may cause to isolated ecosystems. As mainland natural areas become fragmented, degraded and depauperate, they acquire many of the ecological attributes of islands, including limited habitat area, missing functional groups, declining species diversity, and disturbed habitats. A better understanding of invasions on islands may improve our attempts to protect both mainland and island ecosystems from the impacts of exotic species.
40035727|Plant microfossil and macrofossil associations obtained from six dated sections from the area of the basin of Bogot (2550 m, Eastern Cordillera, Colombia) show the evolution of the late Neogene Andean montane forest, triggered by the Andean orogeny. Progressive adaptation of warm tropical taxa to cool montane conditions, evolution of new neotropical montane taxa, and immigration of temperate Laurasian, Holarctic, and Austral-Antarctic elements gave shape to the present-day montane forest. Vegetational characteristics inferred from fossil plant associations reveal the altitude at the time of deposition. Neogene forests are floristically compared with contemporary forests at comparable altitudinal intervals in the surroundings of the Bogot basin; however, the absence of taxa that had not yet arrived, or evolved, is most salient and shows that non-analogue plant communities are common. The main phases of montane forest development are: (1) pre-uplift phase of the late Miocene with abundant lowland taxa with tropical or neotropical affinities (Mauritia Kunth, Amanoa Aubl., Ceiba Miller, and representatives of Humiriaceae); montane forest rich in Podocarpaceae (potentially including Nageia Gaertn., Podocarpus L'Hr., Prumnopitys Phil., and Retrophyllum C. N. Page) covered other previously uplifted areas in the region; (2) toward the early Pliocene the area was uplifted to ca. 1000 m; the relative proportion of temperate taxa of North American and southern South American stock increased and occupied the slopes of the low mountains; and (3) by the middle Pliocene uplift had proceeded to ca. 2000-2200 m and tropical lowland taxa, which are now restricted to altitudes below 1000 m, are no longer recorded in the fossil plant associations; the increase in the number of newly appearing montane taxa (Myrica L., Turpinia Vent., Gunnera L., Bocconia L., Gaiadendron G. Don f., Daphnopsis C. Martius, and Monnina Ruiz & Pav.) suggests a significant increase of diversity. Until the late Pliocene there is little to no evidence for the existence of the pramo; taxa such as Xyris L., Hypericum L., Carex L., Montia L., and Ranunculus L. might have formed swamp or bog vegetation only. It is believed that these taxa colonized mountaintops with half-open vegetation; these areas extended when the mountains reached above upper forest line elevations. The distribution areas of the endemic genera of the Espeletiinae largely coincide with the youngest parts (< 5 Ma) of the northern Andes. Changing climatic conditions forced individual plant species to migrate vertically. Composition of plant communities changed continuously and vegetation belts frequently were altitudinally squeezed or offered possibilities for expansion. This long process stimulated speciation and provoked sequential non-analogue vegetation types. Thus, the biodiversity hotspot of the northern Andes has a dynamic history. /// Los microfsiles de plantas y asociaciones de macrofsiles obtenidos de seis secciones fechadas del rea de la cuenca de Bogot (2550 m, Cordillera Oriental, Colombia) demuestran la evolucin del bosque andino del Negeno tardo, accionado por la orogenia andina. La adaptacin progresiva de taxones tropicales calidos hacia las condiciones fras montanas, la evolucin de nuevos taxones neotropicales montanos y la migracin de elementos templados laursicos, holrticos y austral-antrticos dieron forma al bosque montano actual. Las caractersticas de la vegetacin deducidas de las asociaciones de plantas fsiles revelan la altitud al momento de los depsitos. Los bosques negenes se comparan florsticamente con bosques contemporneos a intervalos altitudinales comparables en los alrededores de la cuenca de Bogot; sin embargo, la ausencia de taxones que todava no haban llegado, o desarrollado, es sobresaliente y demuestra que las comunidades de plantas no anlogas son comunes. Las fases principales del desarrollo del bosque montano son: (1) fase pre-levantamiento del Mioceno tardo con abundancia de taxones de las tierras bajas con afinidades tropicales o neotropicales (Mauritia Kunth, Amanoa Aubl., Ceiba Miller y representantes de Humiriaceae); un bosque montano rico en Podocarpaceae (potencialmente incluyendo Nageia Gaertn., Podocarpus L'Hr., Prumnopitys Phil. y Retrophyllum C. N. Page) cubra otras reas previamente levantadas en la regin; (2) hacia el Plioceno temprano el rea se elev ca. 1000 m; la proporcin relativa de taxones templados de origen norteamericano y suramericano meridional aument y ocup las vertientes de las montaas bajas; y (3) hacia el Plioceno medio, el levantamiento haba llegado hasta ca. 2000-2200 m y taxones tropicales de las tierras bajas, que actualmente se restringen a las altitudes bajo los 1000 m, ya no se registran ms en los registros fsiles de asociaciones de plantas; el aumento del nmero de taxones montanos nuevos (Myrica L., Turpinia Vent., Gunnera L., Bocconia L., Gaiadendron G. Don f., Daphnopsis C. Martius y Monnina Ruiz y Pav.) sugiere un aumento significativo de la diversidad. Hasta el Plioceno tardo, hay poco a ninguna evidencia de la existencia del pramo; taxones como por ejemplo Xyris L., Hypericum L., Carex L., Montia L. y Ranunculus L. pudieron haber formado slo vegetacin de los pantanales o las turbas. Se cree que estos taxones colonizaron las cimas de las montaias con vegetacin semi-abierta; estas reas se extendieron cuando las montaas alcanzaron elevaciones sobre el lmite superior del bosque. Las reas de distribucin de los gneros endmicos de Espeletiinae coinciden en gran parte con las regiones ms jvenes (< 5 Ma) de los Andes del norte. Condiciones climticas cambiantes forzaron a especies individuales de plantas a migrar verticalmente. La composicin de las comunidades de plantas cambia continuamente y los cinturones de vegetacin fueron comprimidos altitudinalmente o se ofrecieron posibilidades de expansin. Este largo proceso estimul especiacin y provoc tipos de vegetacin secuenciales no anlogos, As el punto caliente de biodiversidad de los Andes del norte tiene una historia dinmica.
10.2307/2395337|The taxa of Ficus are classified on the basis of the specificity and morphology of their symbiotic wasps (Agaonidae), systems of pollination, and morphology and physiology of the figs. The new classification is a modification of Corner's system with the following changes. In subgenus Ficus, subsection Eriosycea is elevated to sectional rank. Series Rivulares and Pseudopalmae do not belong to the group of Blastophaga-pollinated figs and are transferred to the new Cerotosolen-pollinated complex of subgenus Sycomorus. Two subsections, Scabrae and Varinga, are recognized in section Sycidium, and series Phaeopilosae and subsection Paleomorphe are recognized as sections. The subgenus Sycomorus is much expanded to include eight sections: Adenosperma, Neomorphe, Prostratae, Pungentes, Pseudopalmae, Rivulares, Sycocarpus, and Sycomorus.
10.2307/2399816|A revision of the South American woody bamboo genus Atractantha is presented, including a key to the species, and descriptions, illustrations, and distribution maps for all five recognized taxa. The Bahia (Brazil) species A. aureolanata and A. cardinalis, both with large, attenuate florets but differing in culm leaf morphology, foliage leaf blade width, and lemma indument, are newly described. Possible affinities of Atractantha with Alvimia, Arthrostylidium, and Elytrostachys are discussed.
10.2307/2395258|Wood anatomy of Epilobium colchicum subsp. colchicum, Fuchsia excorticata, and Hauya heydeana is described qualitatively and quantitatively. For the latter two species, large logs were available and wood portions from both inside and outside were analyzed. Although these three species offer no features new for Onagraceae, each adds features new for its respective genus. By means of numerical indices which are termed vulnerability and mesomorphy, respectively, values are presented to show the range in ecological characteristics of woods of the three species, as well as of all Onagraceae studied earlier. Onagraceae show a wide range in these indices and probably form a good model of what use indices in families with a broad ecological range will demonstrate. Wood from inside of logs of Fuchsia excorticata and Hauya heydeana is more xeromorphic than wood from the periphery.
10.2307/2394925|This monograph recognizes 29 species, 2 subspecies, and 14 formae in the Americas. Conventional means have been employed in determining species limits. The genus is divided into five sections, of which two are described variety is accorded specific rank. Eleven taxa have been altered in rank, 17 proposed names are reduced to synonymy under other taxa of ageratum, and eleven names are removed from the genus. Chromosome numbers are reported for the first time for four species, three chromosome numbers are confirmed, and corrected determinations are made for vouchers of nine previously published chromosome numbers. Taxonomic literature, history of cultivation, economic uses, common names, geography, and generic relationships are discussed. New keys, ecological data, and flowering and fruiting dates are included for the species and the intraspecific taxa. There are 16 distribution maps and illustrations of the new species.
10.2307/2399403|As determined from root tip mitoses, three of the four species of the endemic Cape genus Oldenburgia have the same diploid chromosome number, 2n = 36, and a similar karyotype of small submetacentric to metacentric chromosomes. Base number in the genus is presumed to be x = 9, and Oldenburgia is probably a paleotetraploid relict. It has no close relatives in Africa, and it seems to be most closely related to a group of arborescent South American genera of Gochnatiinae, perhaps the most primitive subtribe of Mutisieae.

First counts for the genera Kaliphora (n = 16) and Haronga (n = 10) also are presented. A new low number (n = 7) is reported for the genus Vernonia, and the possible allopolyploid origin of New World taxa of the genus based on x = 17 is discussed.
10.2307/2399070|Experimental studies demonstrate that up to 20% of the individuals of Atriplex canescens and other species of the genus can alter their sexual state from one season to the next. Approximately 5% of the A. canescens individuals changed from an exclusively pistillate phenotype to an exclusively staminate phenotype or vice versa. Another 5% of the individuals changed their primary sexual emphasis, e.g., from an exclusively pistillate condition to a dominantly staminate, monoecious condition. In addition, 10% of the population changed from a unisexual state to a monoecious state in which staminate and pistillate flowers were approximately equal in number (or vice versa). In Atriplex canescens, sex change occurred in response to three stresses: an unusually cold winter, drought, and prior heavy seed set. When placed under stress, pistillate individuals are significantly more likely to change sex than staminate individuals. The ability to change sex appears to confer a survival advantage to the individual. Plants which change sex also appear to begin reproducing earlier than pistillate plants while producing as many seeds as pistillate plants do. Thus individuals that change sex appear to have some reproductive advantages in the population studied.
10.2307/2992086|The temperate deciduous forest of North America is more diverse than the deciduous forest of western Europe. This difference has traditionally been explained by greater survival in North America of deciduous species during the Quaternary. More recent investigations have shown, however, that late-Tertiary forests of Europe had already become dominated by conifers, with deciduous angiosperms a minor component. During the Quaternary, coniferous species and genera were lost from the European flora, leaving a few species and genera of angiosperms as the dominant trees. Cold, dry, continental climate during the glaciations caused the extinction of conifers; deciduous trees apparently survived these climatic conditions in pockets of favorable habitat in the eastern Mediterranean region. In eastern North America, in contrast, temperate deciduous forests are quite similar to the forests that were present in the late Tertiary. During the Quaternary, relatively few extinctions occurred, although deciduous angiosperms were displaced from the Appalachian mountains, surviving in small populations in the lower Mississippi valley or on the southern coastal plain. Coniferous forests dominated by spruce grew in the Great Plains, and forests dominated by pine grew on the southern part of the Atlantic coastal plain. At the opening of the Holocene, and presumably at the beginning of all the previous interglacials, tree distributions changed dramatically as temperate species rapidly extended their ranges northward. Range boundaries have continued to change throughout the Holocene, as expansions and contractions of range have occurred as the result of climatic change. Quaternary climatic history caused dramatic changes in the forests of both areas, indicating that modern species distributions can no longer be considered relicts of Tertiary distributions. Throughout the Quaternary, species ranges have changed in response to changes in regional climate; many forest communities are of recent origin, having received their present complements of tree species within the last 5,000 years. Forest communities in Eastern North America and in Western Europe as well have been invaded repeatedly during the Holocene by forest species expanding from refuges far to the south.
10.2307/2398790|Populations of Fuchsia lycioides Andrews are composed of small-flowered female plants and an equal number of larger-flowered hermaphrodites, which may be female fertile, or morphologically or physiologically female sterile. A major selective force driving the evolution of separate sexes in F. lycioides is suggested to be the partitioning of limited resources associated with pollinator maintenance and fruit production in a semi-arid mediterranean climate. The hummingbird Rhodopsis vesper atacamensis is the only known pollinator, and appears to be energetically dependent upon F. lycioides. Hermaphrodites are facultative in their fruit production, produce as much as six times more nectar than females, and feed birds both prior to flower opening and during anthesis. Females bear abundant fruit and produce only a relatively small amount of nectar during anthesis. Nectar production is extremely variable in both sexes but is unpredictable in hermaphrodites and apparently predictable in females. The unpredictability of hermaphrodite nectar production may be a key factor permitting the evolution of resource partitioning into large-flowered bird-feeding pollen plants and small-flowered reproductive individuals.
10.2307/2992093|The biovulate subfamily Oldfieldioideae of Euphorbiaceae, characterized by spiny pollen, is an otherwise apparently diverse assemblage of mostly Southern Hemisphere trees and shrubs that traditionally have been allied with genera of Phyllanthoideae and Porantheroideae sensu Pax and Hoffmann. Although fairly diverse anatomically, the following structures characterize the subfamily with only a few exceptions: pinnate brochidodromous venation with generally randomly organized tertiary and higher order venation; foliar and petiolar glands absent; unicellular or unbranched uniseriate trichomes; latex absent; mucilaginous epidermis or hypodermis; brachyparacytic stomata; vessel elements with simple perforation plates and alternate, often very small, intervascular pits; thick-walled nonseptate imperforate tracheary elements; numerous narrow heterocellular rays; and abundant axial xylem parenchyma in diffuse to somewhat banded patterns and often bearing prismatic crystals. Anatomically, the shrubby Australian ericoid genera form a well-defined group with obvious affinities to the more arborescent Australasian genera, which show clear relationships to each other; the African and neotropical genera bearing compound leaves form another distinct group; the remaining genera are somewhat more isolated and seem to represent, in various cases, elements that are primitive within the subfamily or elements derived from the group bearing compound leaves. Presence of theoid teeth and palmately compound leaves in Oldfieldioideae are features consistent with Dilleniid origin for Euphorbiaceae.
10.2307/2992084|The close floristic relationship and disjunct occurrence of many plant taxa between eastern Asia and eastern North America has been given special attention by many botanists. Formerly some people thought that this close floristic link was a result of extensive migrations mainly through Beringia, but recently plate tectonic studies demonstrated that the opening of the North Atlantic Ocean was completed as late as the middle Eocene and the land bridge (Beringia) between Asia and North America was not available until the Miocene. Thus the extensive migrations via Beringia did not occur before the Miocene. The present paper reviews the Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic vegetation in China, enumerating plant megafossils of the Late Cretaceous and the Cenozoic Periods so far recorded there. One-half to two-thirds of the Late Cretaceous plants and one-fourth to one-half of the Late Eocene taxa seem similar (or nearly identical) to those of North America, and some plants are cosmopolitan in Laurasia. This indicates that these plants must have migrated directly between eastern Asia and eastern North America via Europe. So far as the megafossils are concerned, after the Eocene only a few Chinese species are common with those of North America. So most of the isolated and disjunct genera of eastern Asia and eastern North America are remnants of ancient plants widely distributed all over the Northern Hemisphere. Eastern Asia and eastern North America at present are two relic temperature centers of the Northern Hemisphere.
3298513|This study was designed to investigate phylogenetic and morphological relationships within Cleome, focusing on the South American species. Relationships were inferred from the chloroplast genomic trnH-psbA. Phylogenetic analyses support the monophyly of Cleome and the recognition of three clades within it, which are supported morphologically by seed and pollen characters. The African clade contains only African species (Old World); the Andean and Tarenaya clades include all the New World species, most of which are distributed in South America. The well-suported Andean clade groups the Andean species and contains Podandrogyne nested within it. The Tarenaya clade is formed mostly by species of the spiny section Tarenaya. Although there is little resolution in the deeper nodes of the phylogeny, the results do suggest that some sections/groups are not monophyletic. In general, seed and, to a lesser extent, pollen characters were found to be systematically useful within Cleome.
10.2307/2399759|Generic classification of North American Lycopodiaceae is analyzed in terms of the general factors that govern the recognition of the rank of genus, the character states that determine affinities, the hypothetical common ancestral groundplan, a tree based on these data, and a translation of this information into a classification scheme. The genera segregated here are based primarily on numerous characters of anatomy, chromosomes, spores, and gametophytes. Those groups that are recognized as genera have many distinguishing features, strong gaps separating them from other groups, monophylesis, uniquely derived states, inability to hybridize, and a level of segregation consistent and comparable with generic division in other pteridophytes. The classification adopted is as follows: subfamily Huperzioideae (Phlegmariurus, Huperzia), subfamily Lycopodioideae (Lycopodium, Diphasiastrum), and subfamily Lycopodielloideae (Pseudolycopodiella, Lycopodiella, and Palhinhaea).
10.2307/2398925|The following chromosome counts are reported: Ferraria glutinosa 2n = 40 (Iridaceae); Mortoniella pittieri 2n = 32 (Apocynaceae); Nemopanthus mucronata 2n = 20 (Aquifoliaceae); Balanites aegyptica 2n = 18 (Balanitaceae); Balanops australina 2n = 42 (Balanopaceae); Neochamaelea pulverulentum 2n = 36 (Cneoraceae); Wendtia gracilis 2n = 18 (Ledocarpaceae); Grevea eggelingii 2n = 24 (Montiniaceae); Trophis phillipinensis 2n = 28 (Moraceae); Uncarina grandidieri 2n = 36 (Pedaliaceae); Holodiscus discolor n = 18 (Rosaceae); Meliosma panamensis 2n = 32 (Sabiaceae); Trigonia virens 2n = ca. 20 (Trigoniaceae); Vochysia lomatophylla 2n = 22 (Vochysiaceae); Teedia lucida 2n = 38 (Scrophulariaceae). Counts include three first reports for a family and 10 first reports for genera.
10.2307/2399288|We present an overall study of the seed morphology and anatomy of all Rhizophoraceae (10 inland and 4 mangrove genera). Morphologically seeds are arillate, winged or nonappendaged; both arillate and winged seeds are borne in capsular fruits, and nonappendaged seeds in baccate or indehiscent hard-walled capsules. Seed coat anatomy is diversified in correlation with the seed and fruit morphology, but a well-developed exotesta and a fibrous exotegmen are common to all inland genera. Despite certain minor divergences, the seed coat of different genera of Rhizophoraceae is defined as exotestal, exotestal-exotegmic, or undifferentiated. Different combinations of seed morphological and anatomical features characterize different genera or groups of genera. An overall comparison of seeds and other reproductive characters confirms that in Rhizophoraceae arillate seeds and the presence of a fibrous exotegmen are plesiomorphic features that can be used in searching for related families. Seed morphology and anatomy also support grouping Rhizophoraceae with Elaeocarpaceae and Celastraceae, and the exclusion of Elaeocarpaceae from Malvales. Our comparison further suggests that the seed morphology and anatomy of Rhizophoraceae have evolved as the result of adaptation to different methods of seed dispersal from ant dispersal to dispersal by wind, bird, mammal, or water. We carried out a cladistic analysis of the genera of Rhizophoraceae on the basis of 16 reproductive characters (including those of seed morphology and anatomy). Blepharistemma, Cassipourea, Comiphyton, Anopyxis, Macarisia, and Sterigmapetalum, all inland genera that have been assigned to Macarisieae, are characterized by having many plesiomorphies (particularly a superior ovary). The last three genera have winged seeds and a thinner seed coat (apomorphies), whereas the first three have arillate seeds. Among the four remaining inland genera, which have been assigned to Gynotrocheae, Crossostylis (with arillate seeds) differs greatly from the others in having only one apomorphy (i.e., an inferior ovary); it retains many plesiomorphies. In contrast, Carallia, Gynotroches, and Pellacalyx share a nonappendaged seed and a persistent meso- and endotegmen, both clearly synapomorphies, and Gynotroches and Pellacalyx further share some distinct synapomorphies, suggesting their close affinities. The four mangrove genera-Bruguiera, Ceriops, Kandelia, and Rhizophora-which have been segregated as Rhizophoreae, share many synapomorphies (e.g., an undifferentiated seed coat and the complete lack of the tegmen), and therefore the coherence of Rhizophoreae is not in doubt. Cladistically the mangrove genera are more closely related to Carallia, Gynotroches, and Pellacalyx than to Macarisieae. Based on our cladistic analysis, the traditional infrafamilial classification is revised, and a new tribe Crossostylideae, which consists of Crossostylis only, is proposed.

10.2307/2399225|Leaf dimension, degree of leaf rolling or folding, and stomatal densities on adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces were measured on herbarium specimens of 39 grass species from a range of dry to wet habitats in western Canada. Stomata were counted on vinyl leaf impressions taken from the herbarium specimens. Representative surfaces also were examined using scanning electron microscopy. All species from dry habitats had narrow rolled or folded leaves (4 mm or less). The proportion of stomata on the abaxial surface of species from dry habitats ranged from 0 to 65%, but 56% of the species were strongly amphistomatous. The results were compatible with a conceptual model predicting that rolling, amphistomatous leaves would be selected for habitats in which water supply and demand fluctuate widely on seasonal or diurnal time scales.
10.2307/2395309|A diploid number of 2n = 20 is reported in Carpolyza, in the four species of Strumaria, and four of the five species of Hessea studied. One species, Hessea zeyheri, has 2n = 22. Similarity of karyotypes in all the species with 2n = 20 appears to indicate a close relationship between them. Hessea zeyheri with 2n = 22 may be a link between the x = 10 group and the remainder of the tribe Amaryllideae in which x = 11 is basic. The possible systematic significance of the difference in base number in Hessea zeyheri is explored and a reevaluation of generic limits is suggested.
10.2307/3298558|The three missions of Systematics Agenda 2000 (SA2000)-to inventory Earth's species, to understand their relationships, and to use the latter to create predictive information systems-define an agenda of research for systematic biology. The recognition that systematic knowledge underpins biological knowledge in general, and applied biology in particular, has resulted in an amazing growth in systematics over the past decade. Increasingly, systematics is being used to solve societal problems. This paper describes seven great questions within systematics and discusses their relevance for, and contribution to, conserving and sustainably using biodiversity. These questions fall into four broad categories: Questions about diversity: What is a species? and How many species are there? Questions about phylogeny: What is the Tree of Life? and What has been the history of character transformation? Questions about biogeography: Where are Earth's species distributed? and How have species' distributions changed over time? and Questions about phyloinformatics: How is phylogenetic history predictive?

10.2307/2399199|Campanulaceae (excluding Lobeliaceae) in North America comprise four genera and 35 species of annual, biennial, and perennial herbs. Generic and specific circumscriptions have been treated variously, and studies of seeds have been few and limited. In this study, seeds of all but one of the native North American species and of selected Eurasian putative relatives were examined with the light and scanning electron microscope. Characteristics of the seeds and their surface cells are described and compared. The seed-coat morphology was found to be relatively uniform, but there are recognizable generic patterns and a number of distinctive individual species. Seeds of Campanula americana, C. divaricata, and the other eastern species of Campanula are each distinctive and do not show the relative uniformity seen within Githopsis, Triodanis, Heterocodon, and the western species of Campanula. Seeds of the recently rediscovered C. robinsiae and of the wide-ranging C. aparinoides are highly distinctive and would appear to set each of these species apart within the genus. However in Triodanis, T. texana stands apart. Seeds of Campanula reverchonii resemble those of Triodanis coloradoensis more than those of other campanulas. Brief speculation on the adaptive significance of seed-coat sculpturing and ornamentation is given.
40035760|Darwin's panoramic view of biology encompassed two metaphors: the phylogenetic tree, pointing to relatively linear (and divergent) complexity, and the tangled bank, pointing to reticulated (and convergent) complexity. The emergence of phylogenetic systematics half a century ago made it possible to investigate linear complexity in biology. Assumption 0, first proposed in 1986, is not needed for cases of simple evolutionary patterns, but must be invoked when there are complex evolutionary patterns whose hallmark is reticulated relationships. A corollary of Assumption 0, the duplication convention, was proposed in 1990, permitting standard phylogenetic systematic ontology to be used in discovering reticulated evolutionary histories. In 2004, a new algorithm, phylogenetic analysis for comparing trees (PACT), was developed specifically for use in analyses invoking Assumption 0. PACT can help discern complex evolutionary explanations for historical biogeographical, coevolutionary, phylogenetic, and tokogenetic processes.
