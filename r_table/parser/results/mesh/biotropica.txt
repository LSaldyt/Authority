10.2307/2388472|Clone structure, growth characteristics, and reproductive behavior of individual ramets and clones were investigated over a 3 yr period for Geonoma congesta ("cana de danta"), an abundant understory palm of the Atlantic lowland forest in Costa Rica. The 0.6 ha study area contained 123 clones. Mean clone size was 7.1 ramets; only 3 percent of the clones sampled had more than 20 ramets. Within a clone, new ramets are produced sporadically, 1 to 4 ramets at a time. Ramet mortality is often associated with physical damage from falling trees, lianas, and branches. Less than 30 percent of the ramets with stems were erect. Over 58 percent of stemmed ramets were bent or otherwise leaning; whereas, 11.6 percent had been forcibly smashed to the ground. Ramets produced on average 10.1 new leaves and abscised 9.7 leaves in 3 yr. Rates of leaf production and leaf abscission did not vary significantly among ramet stage classes. Stem elongation was greatest in shorter, younger ramets. In taller, older ramets, leaf size and number decreased over the study period. Reproductive clones comprised 64 percent of the clones in 1986; whereas, only 24 percent of individual ramets reproduced. Ramets that reproduced every year had significantly larger leaves and substantially greater crown leaf area than the other reproductive classes. Stage classes with the greatest frequency of reproduction exhibited the greatest decrease in both crown size and leaf size. Individual ramets are estimated to live an average of 60-70 yr; whereas, clones may persist for 100 yr or more. The growth form of Geonoma congesta ensures that clones persist despite a high incidence of ramet mortality and damage. Moreover, at least one ramet within a clone is likely to reproduce every year, although individual ramets may not reproduce every year. Patterns of growth and reproduction in G. congesta are consistent with the hypothesis that the growth of young, deeply shaded sprouts is supplemented by production from older, taller stems.
10.2307/2989720|Four species of bats have been reported to modify leaves of various plants to produce tents for daytime roosts. Herein we report tent-making by a fifth species, Artibeus jamaicensis (Chiroptera: Phyllostomatidae) In addition we report bat tents from Scheelea rostrata, Geonoma congesta. Bactris wendlandiana, and Asterogyne martiana, four species of palms not previously known to harbor them. A review of the plants used by bats for tents reveals a preference for species with a broad leaf surface, though pinnate leaf forms may also be used. Tents may provide effective protection from predators through total concealment or through the disruptive pattern presented. Tents in species with broad leaves probably require less effort for construction and provide better protection from the weather.
40891351|Suspended soils in forest canopies are thought to harbor a substantial fraction of canopy biomass and many arboreal specialists, but do forest floor generalist predators with high vagility also use this habitat? We tested the hypothesis of no difference between forest floor and suspended-soil predatory mite faunas (Acari: Mesostigmata) in an Australian rain forest. Our results show that instead of being habitat generalists, many predatory mites partition soil into two main strata: soil suspended aboveground irrespective of height (0.5-20 m) and soil on the ground. Of 53 species of Mesostigmata in suspended soil, 53 percent (28 species) were absent from or rarely found on the ground. This increased to 60 percent (15/25 species) if only common species are considered. Among these 15 'suspended-soil specialists', all but the three least abundant were found throughout the arboreal strata. Moreover, ten species also occurred in litter accumulated on the surface of decaying logs or boulders close to the forest floor. Thus, although the arboreal predatory mite fauna is distinct from that on the forest floor, it is not restricted to the high canopy: even slightly elevated substrate appears acceptable as habitat for these suspended-soil specialists. Our data suggest that a substantial portion of a rain forest's soil and litter fauna is held above the forest floor.
10.2307/2388200|In the predominantly monoecious genus Begonia, pollen is the only floral reward to pollinators. To investigate the hypothesis that female Begonia flowers attract pollinators by mimicking male flowers, we studied floral display and pollinator behavior in a population of the protandrous perennial herb Begonia involucrata at Monteverde, Costa Rica. The stigmas of the female flowers are bicornute and dark yellow, strongly resembling the anthers of male flowers. The petaloid sepals of male flowers are somewhat larger than those of female flowers, but the number of open flowers does not differ between male- and female-phase inflorescences. Both male and female inflorescences have a sweet odor. Trigona grandipennis, the most frequent flower visitor in the study population, consistently showed a strong preference for male-phase inflorescences; on average, individual male inflorescences received 3.4-9.6 (median 7.2) times as many visits as female inflorescences during five different observation periods. Moreover, visits to male flowers lasted about ten times longer than visits to female flowers (mean 29.8 versus 2.6 seconds). Although visits to female flowers were infrequent and brief, fruit set averaged 76 percent and seed set 57 percent. A hand-pollination experiment indicated that seed set was pollen limited (1.4 times higher after supplemental pollination), but that fruit set was not. Taken together, the striking similarity in male and female flower display, the selective pollinator behavior, and the relatively high levels of fruit and seed set support the hypothesis that the rewardless female flowers of B. involucrata mimic male flowers and are pollinated by deceit.
10.2307/2388684|Observations and experiments show that Erioscelis emarginata (Dynastinae, Scarabaeidae), the sole pollinator of Philodendron selloum (Araceae), is guided at dusk to the inflorescences in their female stage by a combination of olfactory and visual stimuli. At close range, visual stimuli are induced by olfactory stimuli and the beetles orient themselves by the light inner side of the spathe. Light models are more attractive than dark ones. Nonfragrant spathes or spathe models, which are put closest to the odor sources, are most visited. Odoriferous inflorescences in the female stage emit stimuli for Erioscelis that are present to remain, while in male-stage inflorescences such stimuli are absent. Light inhibits beetles from leaving male-stage inflorescences.
10.2307/2388953|The stem allometry (tree height versus stem diameter) of four tree species found in a North Queensland rainforest was examined. These species were dicotyledonous trees, two of which were classed as early successional species and two as later successional species. No significant differences (P > 0.05) were found in the stem allometry of dicotyledonous trees of the same successional status. However, significant differences (P < 0.05) in stem allometry were found when comparing species of different successional status. Later successional species, but not early successional species, were found to be "elastically similar" to a theoretical buckling limit. The relationship between stability safety factors and tree height indicated that both early and later successional species have large buckling safety margins when of low stature. At medium statures (subcanopy), early successional species display a moderate buckling safety margin while later successional species exhibited their lowest buckling safety margin. At tall statures (canopy and above), early successional species exhibited their lowest buckling safety margin while later successional species had moderate buckling safety margins. Stem allometry may be influenced by a tree's life-span, wood density, and environmental conditions in its crown region.
10.2307/2388171|Espeletia schultzii (Compositae) Wedd., a caulescent rosette species common above treeline in the Venezuelan Andes, retains dead leaves on the stem. Plants with bare stems have a higher probability of dying than control plants during the dry season.
10.2307/2989787|The overlooked genus Llerasia Triana (Compositae), which was synonymized with Vernonia by Bentham, is here reinstated and included in the Astereae. Its identity with the section Diplostephioides (Benth. & Hook.) Bl. of genus Haplopappus and its separation from this genus are discussed. The name Neosyris Greene is also a synonym. A key is given for the eleven species of Llerasia, which are trees, large shrubs, or woody lianas of the Andean forests. The intertropical distribution of the genus is emphasized. The distribution of the true remaining Haplopappus species is split into two areas, one North American, the other Chilean-Argentinian. Eight new specific combinations are proposed and a new species (Llerasia hutchisonii) is described.
10.2307/2989661|Very slow sucker shoot regeneration rates are recorded for Vaccinium Consanguinium, Hypericum caracasanum, Chusquea subtesselata, and Castilleja irasuensis three years after a fire at 3300 m elevation in Costa Rica. Colonization after the fire was very slow; three years later there were still large patches of bare ground. Decomposition of stems killed by the fire was so slow that many were still intact and upright after three years.
30043077|We studied changes in a population of red-footed Amazonian tortoises, Geochelone carbonaria, consequent to isolation in an insular forest fragment. Altered age structure, population density, and body growth rate are shown here for the first time to be associated responses. Age structure was strongly biased toward juveniles and growth rates were reduced compared to the mainland. Our data suggest that density-dependent processes induced by habitat fragmentation changed demography and life history parameters in a scant 16 years.
10.2307/2388709|Adult and subadult red-bellied tamarins (Saguinus labiatus) were tested for responses to the odors of predatory and non-predatory neotropical mammals. Methylene chloride extracts of the feces of the jaguar (Panthera onca), margay (Felis wiedi), jaguarundi (Herpailurus yagouaroundi), tapir (Tapirus terrestris), paca (Cuniculus paca), and agouti (Dasyprocta fuliginosa) were presented to tamarins on wooden dowels in their enclosures. Untreated dowels and dowels treated with methylene chloride served as controls. Chemicals from predators elicited more sniffing and avoidance than did those of the non-predators or controls. The tamarins gave alarm calls to margay scent, a response not observed with the other extracts. The responses to predator chemicals were exhibited by captive-born individuals, suggesting that experience with a predator is not necessary for tamarins to distinguish between the fecal scents of predatory and non-predatory species.
30043202|I studied the reproduction of the 9 g nectarivorous bat Glossophaga commissarisi (Phyllostomidae: Glossophaginae) in relation to its food choice in a Costa Rican lowland rain forest over more than 2 yr. Reproduction was bimodal with birth peaks in April/May and October/November. The first birth peak coincided with a period of frugivory, whereas the second occurred during a period of almost exclusive nectarivory. All adult females recaptured in consecutive reproductive periods were reproductively active on both occasions, indicating that individual G. commissarisi females regularly reproduce twice per year at the study site. Throughout the annual cycle the mean testis length of the males correlated best with the proportion of females lactating, suggesting a. post partum estrous pattern. Animals became reproductively active at about 1 yr of age. Fecal samples showed that females consumed significantly more insects than males. /// Se estudi la reproduccin del murcilago nectarvero Glossophaga commissarisi (Phyllostomidae: Glossophaginae) en relacin a sus preferencias alimenticias en un bosque lluvioso de tierras bajas en Costa Rica por ms de dos aos.

30043115|The co-extinction of interdependent species in relation to massive, long-term habitat disturbance has not been thoroughly investigated. Using logistic regression analyses, we examined the relationship between the loss of butterflies and their specific hostplants from the tropical island of Singapore and report the probable occurrence of their co-extinctions at the community level. Our simulation shows that the number of extinct butterfly species is expected to increase exponentially with that of extinct hostplants. The close association between butterflies and their hostplants suggests that the preservation of whole habitats is urgently needed if we are to avoid the possible cascading effects of Species (co-) extinctions.
2663933|Litter disappearance was examined before (1989) and after (1990) Hurricane Hugo in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico using mesh litterbags containing abscised Cyrilla racemiflora or Dacryodes excelsa leaves or fresh Prestoea montana leaves. Biomass and nitrogen dynamics were compared among: (i) species; (ii) mid- and high elevation forest types; (iii) riparian and upland sites; and (iv) pre- and post-hurricane disturbed environments. Biomass disappearance was compared using multiple regression and negative exponential models in which the slopes were estimates of the decomposition rates subsequent to apparent leaching losses and the y-intercepts were indices of initial mass losses (leaching). Cyrilla racemiflora leaves with low nitrogen (0.39%) and high lignin (22.1%) content decayed at a low rate and immobilized available nitrogen. Dacryodes excelsa leaves had moderate nitrogen (0.67%) and lignin (16.6%) content, decayed at moderate rates, and maintained the initial nitrogen mass. Prestoea montana foliage had high nitrogen (1.76%) and moderate lignin (16.7%) content and rapidly lost both mass and nitrogen. There were no significant differences in litter disappearance and nitrogen dynamics among forest types and slope positions. Initial mass loss of C. racemiflora leaves was lower in 1990 but the subsequent decomposition rate did not change. Initial mass losses and the overall decomposition rates were lower in 1990 than in 1989 for Dacryodes excelsa. Dacryodes excelsa and C. racemiflora litter immobilized nitrogen in 1990 but released 10-15 percent of their initial nitrogen in 1989, whereas P. montana released nitrogen in both years (25-40%). Observed differences in litter disappearance rates between years may have been due to differences in the timing of precipitation. Foliar litter inputs during post-hurricane recovery of vegetation in Puerto Rico may serve to immobilize and conserve site nitrogen.
10.2307/2387903|Field studies on seed dispersal by fish in the inundated Amazonian vegetation were carried out in a varzea forest of the Rio Madeira in Humaita, Amazonas. Of the 33 plant species studied, 16 had seeds or fruits regularly dispersed by fish, and in 17 species the seeds were usually destroyed when eaten. Seeds dispersed by fish belong to flowering plant groups which are relatively primitive, whereas those that are destroyed are more advanced; a result which confirms that ichthyochory is an archaic form of dispersal within primitive angiosperms that has been maintained in inundated tropical regions. The high frequency of ichthyochory is associated with nutrient-poor Amazonian waters, where fish depend substantially on allochthonous material such as seeds and fruits which fall into the water. The homogeneity of the inundated vegetation in Amazonia may be the result of migratory fish dispersing diaspores.
10.2307/2989803|Male Euglossa imperialis (Apidae, Euglossini) were marked after capture at cineole, a compound in orchid floral fragrances. Recaptures revealed that a large number of males may be available for pollination of a given orchid and that individual bees may remain at one locality throughout a morning and may be recapturable at that site over a period of several days.
30043276|Structural and floristic components of vegetation and fruit production were examined to evaluate the relative importance of each vegetation aspect on patterns of habitat use and to determine whether differences in degree of frugivory would affect sensitivity of birds to vegetation components. Abundances of 12 bird species were quantified in four different habitat types in the Southeastern Atlantic rain forest of Brazil using captures with mist nets. Structural and floristic traits and fruit production were sampled within plots along the mist net lines. Best explanations for the variation in species abundance were obtained by different combinations of the vegetation components (generalized linear models, Akaike information criterion; R2 mean values = 0.48,  AlCc = 0). Although each species had a particular preference for some vegetation variables, floristic components stood out in those relationships, generating models with a stronger explanatory capacity (ir > 0.40) and higher levels of empirical support ( AlCc = minimum values). The variation in bird sensitivities to the floristic component was associated with bird dependence on a fruit diet: there was a correlation between the explanatory capacity of models built with only floristic composition and a species' degree of frugivory (Spearman rank correlation, r = 0.66, P = 0.04), indicating that floristics had a higher effect in more frugivorous birds. For the other vegetation components, there was no clear pattern with statistical support. These results indicate that sensitivities of bird species to vegetation aspects are associated with their dependence on a fruit diet.
10.2307/2387882|Solitary and group-foraging patterns were observed in the lesser spear-nosed bat, Phyllostomus discolor, while visiting flowers. Observations made at flowering plants of Lafoensia glyptocarpa and two species of Bauhinia in southeastern Brazil suggest that these patterns may be related to the number of flowers or amount of food presented by a given plant.
40863788|We argue that there is not enough science to appropriately support many of the conservation measures currently being proposed, and hence, we cannot be sure of the objectivity of the conservation actions being implemented. The objectivity claimed to be underlying conservation actions is more assumed than real. We also suggest that the approach to conservation is driven more by moral commitments than by tested concepts, and it is further biased by our anthropocentric evaluation of ecological processes and their outcomes. Conservation science is a young subject, which needs to be nourished while it continues to feed on its roots-ecology and evolutionary biology.
30045516|We studied the impact of hunting on monkey species in the Ta National Park and adjacent forests in Cte d'Ivoire. The average wild meat consumption per capita per year was assessed from market surveys and interviews. We determined that the amount of primate wild meat being extracted in the Ta National Park and surrounding forests was 249 t in 1999. Hunting pressure was the highest on the larger primate species such as red colobus, Procolobus badius, black and white colobus, Colobus polykomos, and the sooty mangabey, Cercocebus torquatus atys. Estimates of population densities were based on line transect surveys. The maximum annual production of each species was calculated using the Robinson and Redford model (1991) and assuming unhunted conditions. Comparing current harvest levels with the maximum sustainable yield suggests that harvest of red colobus monkeys (Procolobus badius) is sustainable, whereas current off-take of the black and white colobus (Colobus polykomos), the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys), diana monkeys (Cercopithecus diana), and Campbell's monkeys (Cercopithecus campbellt) exceeds sustainability by up to three times. /// Nous avons tudi l'impact de la chasse sur les espces de singes dans le Parc National de Ta et ses principales forts priphriques en Cte d'Ivoire.

30045377|The Neotropical little fire ant, Wasmannia auropunctata, is notorious for its negative impacts on the native biota of tropical islands, such as the Galapagos and New Caledonia, where it has been introduced. Here, I evaluate the impact of exotic W. auropunctata populations on continental Africa. I surveyed ants at nine sites in Lop National Park in Gabon, Central Africa, and found a highly significant correlation between ant diversity and length of infestation by W. auropunctata. I found many more native ant species present in areas not infested with W. auropunctata (39.0  4.6) compared with areas infested by W auropunctata for approximately 5-10 yr (7.0  6.2 and 1.7  1.2, respectively). In infested areas, W. auropunctata made up the bulk of specimens collected in every plot. This study demonstrates that the threat posed by W. auropunctata to biodiversity is as serious in continental ecosystems as it is in the more fragile island ecosystems of previous studies. Introductions near waterways are particularly devastating: in Lop, the infested territory is most extensive along waterways and occurs in a pattern that strongly suggests moving water facilitates colonization. /// La petite fourmi rouge, Wasmannia auropunctata, est rpute pour ses impacts ngatifs sur la biocnose indigne des les tropicales o elle a t introduite, comme aux les Galpagos et en Nouvelle-Caldonie.

10.2307/2389203|Forest structure and the use of feeding and nest trees by Ratufa indica were assessed at a disturbed and an undisturbed riverine habitat in Bori Wildlife Sanctuary, central India. There were differences in the availability of large trees between the sites. However, despite these differences in forest structure, R. indica at both sides showed similar preferences for feeding in trees greater than 150 cm in girth at breast height (GBH) and with heights greater than 15 m. A preference for larger trees was also observed in the use of nest trees. Though the species may be able to adapt to disturbed forests, there is preferential use of tall mature trees and dependence on canopy continuity. The assessment of forest structure is essential in determining habitat suitability for grant squirrel.
10.2307/2389104|Substrate and elevation fundamentally affect the primary successional fate of plant communities on Mauna Loa Volcano, Hawai'i. Native perennial grasslands dominated by Deschampsia nubigena form after initial forest development within well-defined elevational limits on pahoehoe lava flows. Woody vegetation continues to dominate at both higher and lower elevations. Woody vegetation is also dominant at all elevations of 'a'a flows. The exotic perennial grass. Anthoxanthum odoratum. has invaded sites where D. nubigena is a major component of the vegetation.

10.2307/2387887|The leaf-top herbivore guild of Heliconia spp. is a particularly good subject for the examination of host colonization because individuals may be monitored easily for extended periods of time. Studies of the guild on H. imbricata in Costa Rica and on H. latispatha in Ecuador reveal substantial variation in the rates of colonization among plants. The variation is explained best by the insects' response to environmental conditions, in particular, light and moisture.
4132966|We assessed species richness and composition of ant assemblages in adjacent montane forest and secondary (anthropogenic) grassland habitats in the central plateau of Madagascar. We used five quantitative methods (leaf litter sifting, two types of pitfall traps, beating low vegetation, and soil digging) and compared methods within and across habitats. Sample-based and occurrence-based accumulation curves demonstrated that the efficiency of ant inventory methods is habitat specific. Litter sifting, however, was the single most efficient method in both habitats. Overall, our analyses of the relative efficiency of methods recommend the use of sifting and beating in the montane forest site, and sifting alone in the grassland site. In four of five methods, more species were collected in the grassland site (31 spp.) than in the forest site (26 spp.). Occurrence-based accumulation curves based on all methods demonstrated that species richness was similar in the two habitats, reaching a maximum difference of approximately one species. Only five species were shared between the grassland and forest sites. The presence of a high number of ant species restricted to the grassland site (18 spp.) is the first record of high endemism in this habitat in Madagascar and may have strong implications for the reconstruction of the natural vegetation types at the time humans arrived. Their presence suggests that a comparable open habitat, such as montane woodland, shrubland, or thicket, was present on Madagascar long before humans developed the secondary grasslands less than 2000 years ago. These results are contrary to the "classical hypothesis" that the central plateau was a continuous region of closed forest. These results support the hypothesis that the montane regions, including the central plateau, once contained areas of habitat with an open structure and that the endemic ants now found in the secondary grasslands were originally native to such a habitat.
10.2307/2388395|Ants were sampled using pitfall traps in two replicate 1 ha plots of each of three experimental fire treatments (annually burned, biennially burned, and unburned for over 14 years) in a eucalypt-dominated savanna of tropical northern Australia. The ant fauna was extremely diverse, with 81 species from 24 genera recorded. Species were classified into functional groups based on habitat requirements and competitive interactions, with the most important groups being dominant species of Iridomyrmex (11 species, 14-63% total ants in traps); generalized myrmicines (mostly species of Monomorium and Pheidole; total of 22 species, 11-61% total ants in traps); hot climate specialists (species of Melophorus. Monomorium ("Chelaner") and Meranoplus; total of 14 species, 1-16% total ants in traps); cryptic species (many genera; total of 13 species, 2-27% total ants in traps); and, opportunists (mostly species of Rhytidoponera and Tetramorium; total of 11 species, 3-12% total ants in traps). Ant communities in the annually burned plots were characterized by relatively high numbers of dominant Iridomyrmex, hot climate specialists and opportunistic Rhytidoponera aurata, and low numbers of generalized myrimicines and cryptic species. The reverse was true for unburned plots. Many species were common under one fire regime, but were rarely or never recorded under the other. These differences were attributed to structural changes in the habitat caused by fire, and in particular to the levels of litter accumulation and insolation on the ground. These changes influenced ants directly, but also had important indirect effects through their influence on the abundance of dominant Iridomyrmex, and therefore on competitive interactions. The ant communities in the biennially burned plots were generally intermediate to those of the unburned and annually burned plots. However, one was more similar to those in the annually burned plots, while the other resembled those in the unburned plots. These results demonstrate that different fire regimes have a major influence on one of the most important faunal groups in tropical savannas, and this has important implications for conservation management in these ecosystems.
10.2307/2388288|Chestnut mannikin (Lonchura malacca), an Estrildine finch recently introduced in Puerto Rico, is a widespread Southeast Asian species. In its native habitat it frequently nests in vegetation over water, but in Puerto Rico it usually nests in dense sugar cane. In a marsh ecosystem in Humacao, mannikins nest in clumps of Cyperus spp. growing on top of stumps in a lagoon (depth = 50 cm). Their nests are in sedge clumps that are in shallower water and on higher stumps, and that are taller, wider and denser than clumps without mannikin nests. Nests were usually placed on the south side of the clump, with the entrance facing open water. The predator protection offered by nesting over water may account for nests being placed in relatively open sites.
10.2307/2387794|Eulaema bombiformis, E. meriana, and E. seabrai form part of a Mullerian mimetic complex in the Amazon basin, and all three are exceedingly similar in that region. In eastern coastal Brazil all three species are found, but they are not mimetic there, and are easily distinguished. In coastal Venezuela and northern Central America, E. meriana and E. seabrai form part of a different mimetic complex, and are easily distinguished from E. bombiformis, but show the same color pattern as E. meriana in coastal Brazil (the "flavescens" pattern). It is thought that these mimetic complexes evolved in isolation in Pleistocene refugia, and that the "bombiformis" pattern of Amazonia has invaded trans-Andean Colombia and southern Central America, where it is replacing the "flavescens" pattern in E. meriana and E. seabrai. Critical features are illustrated, and a key to the species Eulaema is presented, together with taxonomic and biological notes.
30043253|Decomposition is a critical process for nutrient release and accumulation of soil organic matter in disturbed soils, such as those found on landslides. I conducted a decomposition experiment on five landslides in the Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico as part of an investigation of the successional roles of two of the most common plant colonists to landslides, Cecropia schreberiana Miq. (Cecropiaceae) a pioneer tree species, and Cyathea arborea (L.) Sm. (Cyatheaceae) a pioneer tree fern. I compared leaf litter decomposition over one year and the initial and 1-yr chemistry for both species. Initial litter chemistry differed between the two species, as Cecropia had slightly higher nitrogen (9.2 mg/g) than Cyathea (8.2 mg/g) and higher lignin (28.6%) than Cyathea (26.0%), but water-soluble carbon and nonpolar extractable carbon (fats and oils, waxes, chlorophylls) were higher in Cyathea than Cecropia. Total carbon, acid-soluble carbon, total phosphorus, and pH did not differ significantly between leaf litter species. Across all five landslides, Cyathea (k = 0.93  0.06) leaves decomposed significantly faster than Cecropia (k = 0.68  0.06). The differences in these species leaf litter decomposition rates and chemical composition could potentially influence organic matter dynamics and nutrient cycling rates in these early successional systems. /// La descomposicin es un proceso crtico para la liberacin de nutrientes y la acumulacin de materia orgnica en suelos perturbados, tales como los que se encuentran en derrumbes.

El carbono foliar total, carbono soluble en cido, fsforo total y el pH no difirieron significativamente entre especies. A travs de los cinco derrumbes, las hojas de Cyathea (k = 0.93  0.06) se descompusieron significativamente ms rpido que las de Cecropia (k = 0.68  0.06). Las diferencias en las tasas de descomposicin de estas especies y la composicin qumica podran potencialmente afectar la dinmica de la materia orgnica y el ciclo de los nutrientes en estos sistemas sucesionales tempranos.
2663836|Most montane rain forests on the island of Hawaii consist of a closed canopy formed by Cibotium spp. tree ferns beneath an open canopy of emergent Metrosideros polymorpha trees. We used artificial seedlings to assess the extent to which physical disturbance caused by the senescing fronds of tree ferns and the activities of feral pigs might limit tree regeneration. Artificial seedlings were established terrestrially (N = 300) or epiphytically (N = 300) on tree fern stems. Half of the seedlings on each substrate were in an exclosure lacking feral pigs and half were in forest with pigs present. After one year, the percentage of seedlings damaged was significantly greater among terrestrial seedlings (25.7%) than epiphytic seedlings (11.3%). Significantly more terrestrial seedlings were damaged in the presence of pigs (31.3%) than in the absence of pigs (20.0%). Senescing fronds of tree ferns were responsible for 60.3 percent of the damaged seedlings. Physical disturbance is potentially a major cause of seedling mortality and may reduce the expected half-life of a seedling cohort to less than two years.
2663871|The mobile crane of the Surumoni project allowed for the first time ever a complete inventory and spatial description of the epiphytic vegetation of a tropical lowland rain forest plot (1.5 ha), at La Esmeralda on the upper Orinoco River, Venezuela. A total of 778 individual vascular epiphytes of 53 species was found, dominated by 19 orchid species and 14 species of Araceae. Fifty percent of all individual plants were obligate ant-garden epiphytes. The distribution of epiphytes was highly clumped and not random. The clumped occurrence of holoepiphytes (complete life cycle on host tree) was the consequence of the rarity of suitable phorophytes (host trees; e.g., size and age) in the plot and the preference of ants for gaps where most of the ant-garden epiphytes were found. In comparison, hemiepiphytes were distributed more evenly because of greater independence from tree suitability. The dispersal modes of epiphytes did not explain their distribution patterns. There was no consistent difference in distribution between anemochorous and zoochorous epiphytes, presumably because availability of suitable substrate is the more important factor for epiphyte establishment and growth. Whereas the vertical distribution of epiphytes could be attributed largely to deterministic factors such as physiological adaptation and requirements, horizontal distribution appeared to be governed by suitable substrate, which in turn seemed to be governed by stochastic gap formation.
10.2307/2388809|The problem of pitviper bite in field researchers working in Middle America (Mexico to Panama) was studied using case histories of nine biologists and one project employee bitten during the period of 1980 to 1991. All snakes involved were Bothrops asper Based on local tissue and systemic effects, seven cases were severe, three with permanent disability There were no fatalities. Although antivenom was administered intramuscularly as field treatment to seven victims and later intravenously as hospital treatment to nine as patients, its effect on outcome was uncertain. Nevertheless, intramuscular antivenom is recommended following an adult Bothrops asper bite when there are signs of envenomation and travel time to a treatment facility is more than four hours. The Extractor (Aspivenin) suction device may be of some benefit, but incisions, constricting bands, and electroshock should not be used. Having a prior plan of action and implementing it effectively is most likely to improve outcome. Three bites occurred during 1.5 million person-hours in the field with Bothrops asper at four field operations in Belize, Costa Rica, and Guatemala. Although risk of Bothrops asper bite to field researchers is low, it should not be ignored.
10.2307/2387760|Wood from buttresses of 48 species in 20 families of tropical trees was examined microscopically for the presence of reaction wood (RW), indicated by gelatinous fibers in place of normal wood fibers. Only Eschweilera (Lecythidaceae), Derris (Fabaceae), and three spp. of Ficus (Moraceae) had RW All other species, including one specimen of Guarea (Meliaceae) in which the buttress was under tension due to a leaning trunk, had normal wood structure. Wood from aerial roots, including stilt roots and flying buttresses, of 18 species in six families was similarly examined. A cylinder of well-developed RW occurred in aerial roots of nine species of Ficus and in stilt roots of Cecropia (Moraceae) Reaction wood also occurred on the upper side of stilt roots of Cecropia and Pourouma (Urticaceae) Contraction of the aerial roots of Ficus is related to RW However, although RW has been correlated with stresses in the wood of trunks and branches of many trees, RW cannot be related generally to a supportive role of buttresses in which stresses have been postulated previously.
10.2307/2989706|The study of the architecture and growth of tropical trees is a wide and almost new field of research involving many different branches of botany such as descriptive and experimental morphogenesis, phylogeny, taxonomy, and biogeography. An analysis of meristematic behavior and branching systems in tropical trees has led to the recognition of 21 architectural models. Some of these are exemplified in the present paper by two families, Myristicaceae, which are poor in architectural types, and Euphorbiaceae which are, by contrast, particularly rich.
27742802|Land conversion for agriculture is an increasing threat to biodiversity conservation, but its ecological effects on African birds is practically unknown. We investigated the impacts of agriculture on the diet and productivity of a small, disjunct population of Mackinder's eagle owls (Bubo capensis mackinderi) in central Kenya. Owl diet was determined by analysis of pellets and other remains and compared to small mammal populations estimated by live trapping in two habitats. Small mammal abundance was low and averaged 7.4 small mammals/ha in farms and 0.5 small mammals/ha in grassland. Owls consumed a wide diversity of prey. The majority were mammals (87%) followed by birds (7%) and insects (5%). The percentage of small mammals in owl diet correlated positively with the relative abundance of small mammals during monthly trapping sessions. Diet composition did not influence owl breeding success. Farming activities affected owl diet composition through crop production. The amount of maize, peas, and carrots growing in farms was correlated with the abundance of Mastomys sp. and Procavia sp. in the owl's diet. Agricultural activities had a large effect on Mackinder's eagle owl diet by increasing the abundance of certain small-mammal prey and attracting owl prey to farms, though farming practices harmful to owls were observed.
41241882|For organisms involved in specialized ecological interactions, the potential exists to have congruent evolutionary histories, such that diversification within one lineage of organisms parallels diversification within another. This model of shared evolutionary history has most often been explored in a bitrophic context, particularly with plants and specialized herbivorous insects, though also with other ecological partners such as vertebrate hosts and their invertebrate parasites. Recently, the possibility has been raised that evolutionary histories might be shared across more than two trophic levels, a phenomenon that we term a phylogenetic cascade. We review previous work on tritrophic diversification and discuss outstanding questions, with an emphasis on plants, caterpillars, and parasitoids, in diverse tropical communities.
41241885|In seasonally dry tropical forests, tree species can be deciduous, remaining without leaves throughout the dry season, or evergreen, retaining their leaves throughout the dry season. Deciduous and evergreen trees specialize in habitats that differ in water availability (hillside and riparian forest, respectively) and in their exposure to herbivore attack (seasonal and continuous, respectively). We asked whether syndromes of leaf traits in deciduous and evergreen trees were consistent with hypothesized abiotic and biotic selective pressures in their respective habitat. We measured seven leaf traits in 19 deciduous and 11 evergreen tree species in a dry tropical forest in Western Mexico, and measured rates of herbivory on 23 of these species. We investigated the covariance of leaf traits in syndromes related to phenology and associated physiology, and to anti-herbivory defense. We found evidence for syndromes that separated phenological strategies among four traits: toughness, water content, specific leaf area, and carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratios. We found a trade-off between two other traits: trichomes and latex. Overall, evergreen species exhibited lower rates of herbivory than deciduous species. Lower rates of herbivory were explained by a syndrome of higher toughness, lower water content, and higher C:N ratios, which are traits representative of evergreen trees. Phenology and trait syndromes did not exhibit significant phylogenetic signal, consistent with the hypothesis of evolutionary convergence among phenologies and associated leaf-trait syndromes. Our results suggest that deciduous and evergreen trees could respond to differential water availability and herbivory in their respective habitats by converging on distinct leaf-trait syndromes.
10.2307/2388542|Marked individual Tengella radiata spiders showed low and variable rates of weight gain in the field in old lowland forest in Costa Rica. Calibration studies of weight gained on controlled diets in captivity and rates of metabolism allow extrapolation of field results to probable rates of predation in the field. The prey capture rate for this species is apparently substantially lower than those of other similar sized spiders.
10.2307/2387775|The aerial stilt roots of Socratea exorrhiza allow this palm literally to pick itself up and "walk" out from under fallen limbs and obstacles that are major hazards for immature palms. The lower trunk and older roots rot away and are left behind as the tree sends out new roots and moves away from its germination point.
30045509|Studies of zoochorous seed dispersal systems often consider crop size, yet seldom consider the kinds and amounts of fruits surrounding parent plants (the fruit neighborhood) when attempting to explain among-plant variation in fruit removal. We studied avian frugivory at 24 Schefflera morototoni trees from February to May 1998 in central Puerto Rico. The number of fruits removed by avian seed dispersers per visit was similar among focal trees (typically 2-4). In contrast, visitation rate was highly variable (range: 0-71 visits per 4 h). We used multiple regression analyses to evaluate the relative roles of crop size (focal tree ripe fruit abundance) and fruit neighborhood variables (measured within 30 m of focal trees) in affecting visitation to focal trees by avian frugivores. Visitation rate was positively related to crop size (although this variable was only significant in one of four regression models considered) and negatively related to the presence or abundance of conspecific fruits, suggesting that trees competed intraspecifically for dispersers. Relationships between visitation and heterospecific fruits were mixed-some kinds of fruits appeared to enhance visitation to focal trees, while others seemed to reduce visitation. In most regression models, neighborhood variables had larger effects on visitation than focal tree fruit crop size. Our results highlight the important effects of local fruiting environments on the ability of individual plants to attract seed dispersers. /// Los estudios de sistemas dispersadores de semillas zoocoras por lo general consideran el tamao de la cosecha, sin embargo, raras veces consideran los tipos y cantidades de frutos en los alrededores de las plantas madres (las frutas del vecindario) cuando intentan explicar entre plantas, la variacin de extraccin de frutos. Nosotros estudiamos la frugivoria de aves en 24 rboles de Schefflera morototoni entre Febrero y Marzo de 1998 en la parte central de Puerto Rico. El nmero de frutos removidos en cada visita por las aves dispersadoras de semillas fue similar entre los rboles focales (tpicamente de 2 a 4). En contraste, la proporcin de visitas fu muy variable (intervalo = 0-71 visitas cada 4 horas). Nosotros utilizamos anlisis de regresin mltiple para evaluar el rol relativo del tamao de la cosecha (rboles focales con abundancia de frutos maduros) y variables en frutos del vecindario (medidos dentro de los 30 m de los rboles focales) en el efecto de visitas por aves frugvoras a los rboles focales. La proporcin de visitas estuvo positivamente relacionado con el tamao de la cosecha (aunque esta variable fu solamente significativa en uno de los cuatro modelos considerados) y negativamente relacionado a la presencia y a la abundancia de frutos coespecficos, sugiriendo que los rboles compitieron intraespecficamente por los dispersores. Las relaciones entre visitas y frutos heteroespecficos fue mixta -algunos tipos de frutos parecen promover las visitas a los rboles focales, mientras que otros parecen reducir las visitas. En la mayora de los modelos de regresin, las variables de "vecindario" tuvieron un mayor efecto sobre las visitas que en el tamao de la cosecha de frutos del rbol focal. Nuestros hallazgos enfatizan la importancia que pueden tener los efectos de los ambientes locales de frutos en la habilidad de plantas individuales en atraer dispersadores de semillas.
30043049|Natural hybrids between Ficus septica and two closely related dioecious species, F. fistulosa and F. hispida, were confirmed using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) and chloroplast DNA markers. Ficus species have a highly species-specific pollination mutualism with agaonid wasps. Therefore, the identification of cases in which breakdown in this sophisticated system occurs and the circumstances under which it happens is of interest. Various studies have confirmed that Ficus species are able to hybridize and that pollinator-specificity breakdown can occur under certain conditions. This study is the first example in which hybrid identity and the presence of hybrids in the natural distribution of parental species for Ficus have been confirmed with molecular markers. Hybrid individuals were identified on three island locations in the Sunda Strait region of Indonesia. These findings support Janzen's (1979) hypothesis that breakdown in pollinator specificity is more likely to occur on islands. We hypothesized that hybrid events could occur when the population size of pollinator wasps was small or had been small in one of the parental species. Later generation hybrids were identified, indicating that backcrossing and introgression did occur to some extent and that therefore, hybrids could be fertile. The small number of hybrids found indicated that there was little effect of hybridization on parental species integrity over the study area. Although hybrid individuals were not common, their presence at multiple sites indicated that the hybridization events reported here were not isolated incidences. Chloroplast DNA haplotypes of hybrids were not derived solely from one species, suggesting that the seed donor was not of the same parental species in all hybridization events.
41241937|Edge effects along tropical forest-pasture margins are thought to cause a shift toward early successional characteristics of the understory forest vegetation. We tested this idea by sampling vegetation at five forest sites in northeast Costa Rica each of which had edges that were established over 20 yr earlier. Four of these sites had been selectively logged. We sampled woody plants > 0.2 and  1.3m height in 54 m within 0.2 ha plots at edges (N = 14), and at 150 m (N= 11) and 300 m from edges (N = 9). Composition and diversity did not vary with edge distance. Abundance of tree regeneration, mainly of canopy and emergent species, increased at edges. Abundance of lianas and slow-growing tree species did not differ significantly across the sampling locations. Weighted mean wood density varied little, with a reduction at edges for canopy species. Palms were less abundant at edges, but not less species rich. At edges, these plant assemblages maintain many of the characteristics of forest interior vegetation, though the changes observed may indicate ongoing functional change. Degradation of forest-pasture edges is not a universal feature of tropical forest fragmentation, and forests with high rates of natural turnover might have a high capacity to maintain themselves within forest edges alongside pasture.
10.2307/2387771|Variation in modern maize relates to recent and ancient cultural events. Large complexes of maize races are usually characteristic of certain cultural regions and help to define boundaries and histories. Most of the regions were established by 2000 years ago; clear differentiation of maize must have also occurred by then. Twenty-four racial complexes, numerous sub-complexes, and six regions have been defined here and elsewhere. Most of the complexes seem descended from seven ancestral types plus continual teosinte introgression. Spreading and interaction of these ancient types has had as important consequences as their isolation within regions. Testing of the component hypotheses will be done through continued interdisciplinary study.
41241896|Calandrinia galapagosa (Portulacaceae) is a threatened plant endemic to San Cristobal Island, Galapagos. The species is threatened by goat herbivory: less than 1300 individuals remain in nine populations, three of which have been fenced for protection. It is not known whether these three populations are genetically representative of the species at large or whether the three distinct color morphs exhibited by the species represent different taxonomic units. We measured the frequency of 113 polymorphic amplified fragment length polymorphism markers in 189 specimens representing three different phenotypes from all nine populations to relate the genetic structure of the species to both its geological history and morphological variation. The analysis revealed high diversity within populations and low, but significant, differentiation between populations. In addition, no genetic diversification was observed across color morphs. We conclude that (1) regular gene flow has historically occurred between populations, and (2) individual color morphs are not separate taxa. We identify another population that should be fenced to ensure maximal protection of genetic variation. Our research serves as a case study of using population molecular genetics for optimizing protection strategies for rare plants in tropical archipelagoes affected by introduced herbivores.
2388835|The occurrence and distribution of dictyostelid cellular slime molds (CSM) in the mantle of dead organic matter (literally a "canopy soil") at the bases of large epiphytes were studied in the Luquillo Experimental Forest of northeastern Puerto Rico. CSM were isolated from 18 of 50 samples collected from this microhabitat, and four different species were recovered. Dictyostelium purpureum was the single most abundant species and represented almost half (48%) of all clones isolated during the study. Total densities (clones/g) averaged only 38 in the five forest types examined, but densities > 75 were recorded for two forest types. Relative abundance of CSM in canopy soils of the five forest types followed the same general pattern displayed by these organisms in forest floor litter, but a particular species was not necessarily common to both microhabitats in a given forest type.
27742867|One of the most significant challenges in developing a predictive understanding of the long-term effects of hurricanes on tropical forests is the development of quantitative models of the relationships between variation in storm intensity and the resulting severity of tree damage and mortality. There have been many comparative studies of interspecific variation in resistance of trees to wind damage based on aggregate responses to individual storms. We use a new approach, based on ordinal logistic regression, to fit quantitative models of the susceptibility of a tree species to different levels of damage across an explicit range of hurricane intensity. Our approach simultaneously estimates both the local intensity of the storm within a plot and the susceptibility to storm damage of different tree species within plots. Using the spatial variation of storm intensity embedded in two hurricanes (Hugo in 1989 and Georges in 1998) that struck the 16 ha Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot in eastern Puerto Rico, we show that variation in susceptibility to storm damage is an important aspect of life history differentiation. Pioneers such as Cecropia schreberiana are highly susceptible to stem damage, while the late successional species Dacryodes excelsa suffered very little stem damage but significant crown damage. There was a surprisingly weak relationship between tree diameter and the susceptibility to damage for most of the 12 species examined. This may be due to the effects of repeated storms and trade winds on the architecture of trees and forest stands in this Puerto Rican subtropical wet forest.
20492568|Mature tropical forests are disappearing and secondary forests are becoming more abundant, thus there is an increasing need to understand the ecology and management of secondary forests. In the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, seasonally dry tropical forests are subject to frequent fire, and early-successional stands are extremely dense. We applied vegetation thinning (removal of all stems &lt; 2 cm in diameter) to hasten secondary succession and open the understory to reduce the fire ladder in an 11-yr-old stand. We quantified the effect of vegetation thinning on above- and belowground carbon over 5 yr. Aboveground carbon included all standing vegetation and belowground carbon included fine roots and organic carbon in the Oi, Oe, and Oa soil horizons. Trees with diameter of 2-10 cm and &gt; 10 cm had higher carbon accumulation rates in thinned plots than in control plots. Carbon stored in the Oi-horizon and the Oe &gt; 2 mm fraction remained significantly higher in thinned plots even 5 yr after treatment. Carbon in fine roots was significantly higher in thinned plots, and radiocarbon (C) data suggest that fine roots in thinned plots were recently produced in comparison with fine roots in control plots. We did not find significant differences in total ecosystem carbon after 5 yr (126  6 and 136  8 Mg C/ha, respectively). These results suggest rapid carbon recovery and support the hypothesis that young tropical forests thinned to hasten succession and reduce the fire hazard may have only a short-term negative impact on carbon accumulation in vegetation and soils.
30043264|We compared the allometry of two contrasting late-successional dipterocarp species to test whether a monolayer (shade-toleran)--multilayer (shade-intolerant) model applies to pole-sized trees. Crown traits of the more shade-tolerant species (Vatica micranthd) did not conform to either of the familiar monolayer or multilayer models for pole-sized trees, but instead were consistent with a "persistent multilayer" model. Species differences in crown traits may be influenced more by future rather than present light environments.
41241917|Quantifying ecosystem carbon stocks is vital for understanding the relationship between changes in land use and carbon dioxide emissions. Here, we estimate carbon stocks in an area of miombo woodland in Mozambique, by identifying the major carbon stocks and their variability. Data on the biomass of tree stems and roots, saplings, and soil carbon stocks are reported and compared with other savannas systems around the globe. A new allometric relationship between stem diameter and tree stem and root biomass is presented, based on the destructive harvest of 29 trees. These allometrics are combined with an inventory of 12,733 trees on 58 plots over an area of 27 ha. Ecosystem carbon stocks totaled 110 tC/ha, with 76 tC/ha in the soil carbon pool (to 50 cm depth), 21.2 tC/ha in tree stem biomass, 8.5 tC/ha in tree coarse root biomass, and 3.6 tC/ha in total sapling biomass. Plot-level tree rootrstem (R:S) ratio varied from 0.27 to 0.58, with a mean of 0.42, slightly higher than the mean reported for 18 other savanna sites with comparable aboveground biomass (R:S = 0.35). Tree biomass (stem+root) ranged from 3.1 to 86.5 tC/ha, but the mean (32.1 tC/ha) was well constrained (95% CI 28-36.6). In contrast, soil carbon stocks were almost uniformly distributed and varied from 32 to 133 tC/ha. Soil carbon stocks are thus the major uncertainty in the carbon storage of these woodlands. Soil texture explained 53 percent of the variation in soil carbon content, but only 13 percent of the variation in woody carbon stocks. The history of disturbance (fire, elephants, logging/charcoal production, and shifting cultivation) is likely to decouple changes in woody carbon stocks from soil carbon stocks, mediated by tree-grass interactions.
10.2307/2389184|From July through November 1988 and 1989, apple snail (Pomacea doliodes) and freshwater crab (Dilocarcinus dentatus) populations were surveyed in rice plantations and seasonal wetlands (or "esteros") in the llanos of Venezucla to determine seasonal changes in density and size. Rice plantation sites had significantly higher densities and larger snails than did estero sites. Snail density did not differ significantly between months or years. In contrast, the density and size of freshwater crabs varied significantly by month but not between habitats or years: crabs were smaller and in greatest numbers at the beginning of the rainy season, and then declined in density but increased in size by November. The sex ratio of D. dentatus was skewed towards females, a ratio which was consistent across habitats and months. Fluctuations in snail and crab density and size are discussed in relation to the effects of wetland flooding regimes on the life history characteristics of these animals.
10.2307/2388027|The Serrania de Macuira (865 m) is a small mountain range rising from the arid lowlands of the Guajira peninsula on the Caribbean coast of Colombia. It supports on its summits a cloud forest which is isolated from the nearest extensive moist area by at least 250 km. Palaeoclimatic and geological evidence indicates that the cloud forest is of recent origin and has never been connected to other moist regions. Hardly any of the 126 species of vascular plants in the cloud forest are found in the surrounding dry lowlands, and it is suggested that long-distance dispersal accounts for their presence in the Serrania de Macuira. Forty-one percent of the flora is adapted for internal dispersal by birds, 39 percent for wind dispersal, and 5 percent for external carriage by birds (or mammals) A small percentage show no obvious adaptations for dispersal, but these nevertheless have small propagules and in some cases may have been accidentally introduced by man.
