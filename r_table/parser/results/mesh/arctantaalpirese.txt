4139100| Repeat photography is a powerful tool for detection of landscape change over decadal timescales. Here a novel method is presented that applies spatial analysis software to digital photo-pairs, allowing vegetation change to be categorized and quantified. This method is applied to 12 sites within the alpine treeline ecotone of Glacier National Park, Montana, and is used to examine vegetation changes over timescales ranging from 71 to 93 years. Tree cover at the treeline ecotone increased in 10 out of the 12 photo-pairs (mean increase of 60%). Establishment occurred at all sites, infilling occurred at 11 sites. To demonstrate the utility of this method, patterns of tree establishment at treeline are described and the possible causes of changes within the treeline ecotone are discussed. Local factors undoubtedly affect the magnitude and type of the observed changes, however the ubiquity of the increase in tree cover implies a common forcing mechanism. Mean minimum summer temperatures have increased by 1.5C over the past century and, coupled with variations in the amount of early spring snow water equivalent, likely account for much of the increase in tree cover at the treeline ecotone. Lastly, shortcomings of this method are presented along with possible solutions and areas for future research. 
10.2307/1552524|In order to study the long-term effect of climatic conditions on organic matter decomposition, the difference in the mass loss rate of organic substrates was examined along the altitudinal temperature gradient (1500-2400 m) of Mt. Fuji, Japan. Two standard substrates, cellulose filter paper and wood chips of beech (Fagus crenata), were placed in the L and FH layers at each altitude. The mass loss rates tended to be smaller with increasing altitude and were significantly correlated with the annual mean air temperature in a log-linear fashion. The temperature dependence of the mass loss rates was much larger than that of microbial respiration. The initial increase in ergosterol content (an indicator of fungal biomass) of organic substrates was more rapid at low altitudes than at higher altitudes. The effects of fungal biomass and freezing temperatures on the temperature dependence of decomposition were examined using a simple simulation model. The results suggest that the effects of temperature increase on decomposition could be much larger than those estimated from the temperature-microbial respiration curves.
4095909|Heavy, increasing recreation on Colorado's high peaks has created numerous social trails requiring restoration. We studied success of turf transplants 3 yr after transplanting on Mount Belford in the Sawatch Range, and Humboldt Peak in the Sangre de Cristo Range. Based on point-intercept data, sum of all vascular species' covers was 12% to 31% lower in transplanted plots than in control areas. We found no differences in canopy density and height between transplant and control plots on Mount Belford, while both were about 40% lower in transplants on Humboldt Peak. Species richness adjusted for plot size was slightly greater in transplant plots on Mount Belford and slightly lower on Humboldt Peak. On both peaks, we found greater absolute cover of grasses in transplant plots, while forb cover was lower. After 3 yr, turf transplants effectively established vegetation cover and maintained high species richness in these communities. Whenever turf is available, e.g., new trail construction, it should be used to restore closed social trails and campsites, and turf transplants can be considered in other ecosystems for small disturbances in high-value areas where restoration would otherwise be slow.
40801763|Kasatochi Island is a small volcanic island in the central Aleutian Islands that erupted on 7 August 2008. An interdisciplinary team visited the island and its vicinity in the summer of 2009 to describe the immediate consequences of the eruptions on terrestrial, coastal, and benthic communities. The initial effects of the eruptions on soils, oceanic waters, benthic terrain, terrestrial plants, land birds, shore birds, nesting sea birds, arthropods, marine algae, and marine invertebrates were described. This overview summarizes the conventional understanding of mechanisms that drive the reassembly of devastated ecosystems and shows how studies of Kasatochi Island may enhance our understanding of succession. The presence of residual soils and low mortality among sea birds will hasten early recovery, but significant erosion (removal of tephra and marine sediments) must occur to permit a return to a fully functional ecosystem. Long-distance dispersal over seawater will be needed to replenish the plant communities. While scavenger arthropods survived, dispersal will be needed to generate complete insect communities. Land birds were killed and their habitats destroyed, so their re-colonization awaits vegetation development. Ecosystem recovery will be facilitated by allochthonous inputs of nutrients and by plant establishment. Monitoring how the biota returns to a new equilibrium and comparisons to adjacent islands will allow tests of assembly and biogeographic theory and further our understanding of terrestrial-marine interactions. The study of Kasatochi Island's recovery will produce a valuable story of ecosystem reassembly.
1552435| Analysis of mass balance data from arctic mountain and subpolar glaciers with an aggregate area of more than 300*10<sup>3</sup> km<sup>2</sup> reveals that these glaciers were the main source of increased freshwater inflow to the Arctic Ocean over the 1961-1998 period. The sum of net water inflow from glaciers was larger than net water inflow from rivers in the panarctic region, and the combined contribution from both glacier and land components had accelerated. Compared to the 1961-1990 averaged values, the largest combined contribution was observed at the end of the 1970s, declined in the 1980s, and began increasing again in the mid-1990s. Net glacier inflow supposedly increased due to Northern Hemisphere temperature warming. We attribute the increase in net river inflow to an increase in annual precipitation over the 50-70N latitude belt in North America and Eurasia. 
41416452|This study reports changes of small glaciers in the Trans-Himalayan Kang Yatze Massif, Ladakh, northwest India, between 1969 and 2010. The region covers an area of about 1000 km and is located in a transitional position between predominantly receding glaciers of the Central Himalaya and some advancing ice masses of the Karakorum. A multi-temporal remote sensing approach based on satellite images (Corona, SPOT, Landsat) was used to detect and analyze area changes of 121 small glaciers and to measure the retreat of 60 cirque and valley glaciers between 1969 and 2010. Over the last four decades, the glaciated area decreased by about 14% (0.3% yr) from 96.4 to 82.6 km and the average ice front retreat amounts to 125 m (3 m yr). The ice cover loss shows a high decadal variability with the maximum shrinkage between 1991 and 2002 (0.6% yr), followed by a lower decrease rate since then (0.2% yr). Due to the high variability of glacier change with a generally decreasing trend and a few stable glaciers, it becomes obvious that an extrapolation even on a regional scale is problematic. Therefore, a consideration of differing responses of various glacier types and glacier sizes is of utmost importance.
10.2307/1552257| We compared growing season CO<sub>2</sub> flux patterns between botanically similar arctic and alpine dry tundra ecosystems in Alaska and Colorado under ambient and experimentally warmed conditions. Measurements were taken during the 1997 growing season, 3 yr after the warming treatments were begun. Under ambient weather conditions, arctic dry tundra at Toolik Lake, Alaska was a net source (4 g CO<sub>2</sub>-C m<sup>-2</sup>) of CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere, while alpine dry tundra at Niwot Ridge, Colorado, was a net CO<sub>2</sub> sink (7 g CO<sub>2</sub>-C m<sup>-2</sup>) during the growing season. Experimental warming of arctic tundra by 1 to 3C, resulted in a seven-fold (32 g CO<sub>2</sub>-C m<sup>-2</sup>) increase in this ecosystem's carbon source activity. Similar warming in alpine tundra changed this ecosystem from a net carbon sink to a net carbon source of 8 g CO<sub>2</sub>-C m<sup>-2</sup> over the growing season. In the Arctic, increased CO<sub>2</sub> efflux with warming was largely the result of increased rates of ecosystem respiration throughout the entire growing season, while in the alpine ecosystem respiration increased only early in the growing season. Rates of photosynthesis were generally not affected by experimental warming at either site. These data suggest that global warming will accentuate the carbon source activity of dry tundra in the northern foothills of Alaska and will change the net CO<sub>2</sub> exchange of alpine dry tundra in the northern Rocky Mountains from a net CO<sub>2</sub> sink to a source. 
20181825|Arctic and subarctic ecosystems have undergone considerable environmental changes in recent years as the result of climate warming. Fossil records of freshwater diatoms in lakes throughout the circumpolar Arctic, including the central Canadian Arctic treeline region, have revealed marked directional shifts in diatom assemblages in recent lake sediments. These algal changes have been linked to longer growing seasons, decreased duration of ice cover, and/or increased thermal stability. The effects of these recent environmental changes on higher trophic levels, such as the Cladocera, are still unclear. Using cladoceran remains preserved in the sediments of 50 lakes, which were previously examined for changes in diatoms, we show that significant changes in cladoceran species composition have occurred from pre-industrial times to the present. However, these changes are considerably muted compared to the more substantial changes observed in the diatom record. We found no consistent patterns of change in planktonic cladocerans (i.e. Daphnia, Bosmina) within our study lakes, and the response of the Cladocera to environmental changes does not appear to be strongly coupled to recent changes in diatom communities, thus further confirming that the previously observed diatom changes were related to bottom-up limnological controls. These results highlight the complex response of Arctic freshwater food webs to climate change, and the need for incorporating multitrophic studies into climate change investigations.
40305839|Photosynthesis, as the basis of most food chains and a crucial global carbon sink, makes chief contributions to overall ecosystem carbon budgets, but specific responses of the plant component cannot be obtained from such budgets. To gain much-needed further information on possible interspecies differences in seasonal patterns of photosynthesis, capacities for light-and CO -saturated rates of oxygen evolution at 25C (photosynthetic capacity) were determined during the summer-fallwinter transition for five conifer species over their natural distribution along a steep altitudinal gradient. Findings include (i) a transient upregulation of photosynthetic capacity during the summer-to-fall transition in all five conifer species that preceded the previously reported winter downregulation in conifers. However, there were (ii) interspecific differences in this response at the highest altitudes, with higher maximal photosynthetic capacities displayed by pine and spruce species compared to fir species. Lastly, the winter downregulation of photosynthetic capacity was not as complete in the present study (winter of 2006) as that which has been reported for previous winter seasons, which has implications for the winter survival strategy of conifers in response to global warming.
10.2307/1552528|A 403-yr tree-ring chronology (A.D. 1595-1997) was developed from living and dead Pinus sylvestris L. (Scots pine) from near treeline on the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. Ring-width is significantly correlated with mean July temperatures. A reconstruction of mean July temperatures generally parallels similar dendroclimatic reconstructions from northern Fennoscandia. The Kola reconstruction indicates that the early- to mid-20th century experienced an exceptional period of warm summer temperatures. Dendrochronological techniques were used to estimate the timing of establishment and mortality of Pinus sylvestris at the site. Tree recruitment and mortality appear inversely related and episodic, with pulses of recruitment occurring during the late-17th, 18th, and mid- to late-20th centuries. The mid-20th century pine recruitment episode lags several decades behind the initiation of 20th-century summer warming. Analysis of instrumental climate records and pine recruitment suggests a link between warm fall and early spring conditions in the mid-20th century and increased pine regeneration. The results of this study are similar to findings from northern Fennoscandia and extend this pattern of recent climatic variation and associated treeline response eastward into the Kola Peninsula.
1552175| We present here the 2001-2004 results of observational field studies aimed at quantifying tropical timberline climate and radial increment of Pinus hartwegii Lindl. trees on Nevado de Colima, in the middle of the North American Monsoon region. An automated weather station was installed at 3760 m a.s.l., 1934.778N latitude, 10337.180W longitude, within a forest where multi-century tree-ring records had been previously developed. At the same time, automated electronic sensors for recording tree growth at 30-min intervals were set up at two sites within a 1-km radius from the weather station. Meteorological observations recorded every 30 min were summarized on a daily basis. Time-series patterns are reported for atmospheric pressure, precipitation, incoming solar radiation, air and soil temperature, relative humidity, soil moisture, and wind speed and direction. Of particular interest is the sudden decrease in air temperature after the onset of the monsoon season, which determines very high relative humidity over the summer and results in air temperature having a spring maximum. Despite sub-freezing air temperatures in most months, soil temperatures never drop below 0C. Dendrometer data show that the timberline growing season begins in March-April as temperature increases, then radial growth continues throughout the cool-wet summer monsoon, and ends in October-November. As an unexpected result, it was also possible to measure the progressive decline of Pinus hartwegii stem increment in response to an outbreak of roundheaded pine beetle (Dendroctonus adjunctus Blandford), which ultimately killed most trees at one of our two experimental sites. 
20181771|We investigated the effects of snow and environmental variables on the depths to which moose sank in snow, and the extent to which moose followed in the tracks of other free-ranging moose in the mountains of the subarctic areas of northernmost Sweden. We tested a method to combine the variables that affect snow quality (e.g. density and hardness) into a single variable that is easier to measure in the field. We also studied the snow conditions in the summer and winter ranges of migrating moose. First, we performed correlation analyses that revealed that sinking depths of moose decreased with increasing snow quality, snow depth, altitude, and air temperature. Next, we next used the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to determine the best model of sinking depth, which indicated that the important variables were snow quality, altitude, and snow temperature. For trail-following behavior, the best model included air temperature only. Regarding seasonal ranges, winter ranges had considerably less snow than the summer ranges that these individual moose left, but snow quality did not differ. Overall, our new method to index snow quality (here, using a dynamometer to measure the force required to press a simulated moose foot down in the snow to the depth of a moose footprint) shows promise, and we suggest that future studies of ungulate winter ecology investigate it further.
20181748|Foliar C values measured in 101 samples from 13 sites in northern Tibet aveaged amplitude -26.9, and were higher than those of other mountain regions in the world. C plants were found at 4161 m, higher than C species have been found before. The foliar C values increased with altitude; however, the amplitude of increase was dependent on species. Furthermore, significantly higher C values were found in plants grown in the southern than the northern Tanggula Mountains, a difference ascribed to precipitation.
23252333|Fine-scale genetic structure of plant populations depends on several ecological processes. In this study, we analyzed the impact of hydrological heterogeneity on the spatial genetic structure of the wind-pollinated black sedge Carex nigra in an alpine fen. We performed amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) with 111 samples collected along a grid covering the whole area of the fen and studied fine-scale genetic structure using spatial autocorrelation and Bayesian cluster analyses. We observed a significant spatial genetic structure indicating isolation-by-distance, which can be ascribed to restricted seed dispersal. Bayesian cluster analysis revealed four groups of genetically related and patchy distributed samples within the fen. Two of these groups were distributed in the deeper and moister regions of the fen, while the two other groups were spatially restricted to the higher and drier regions of the fen. We think that the observed pattern of spatial genetic variation reflects hydrological heterogeneity within the fen and conclude that the four groups represent cohorts of individuals originating from different recruitment events in different parts of the fen. Genetic variation was much lower in the groups from the drier regions of the fen. Since Carex species require moist conditions for germination and establishment, the low level of genetic variation can most likely be ascribed to restricted seedling recruitment in the drier regions of the fen. Habitat heterogeneity affects, therefore, both spatial genetic structure and levels of genetic variation. This study clearly demonstrates that integrating fine-scale genetic analyses with complementary biological data can markedly improve the identification of processes that shape fine-scale genetic structure within plant populations.
4095890|Alnus viridis seedlings were planted on placer mine spoil in an Alaskan subalpine watershed to bypass a seedling establishment bottleneck for A. viridis, and to evaluate the interaction between A. viridis and the dominant riparian woody plants, Salix alaxensis and Populus balsamifera. The study area was divided into 11 replicate blocks, each on a homogeneous recontoured spoil pile. Blocks were divided into two 0.01 ha plots, and treatments without (control) and with 84 planted A. viridis seedlings were randomly assigned to plots. After 10 years, the Alnus treatment had a dense stand of A. viridis 1-2 m tall, while the control had fewer, smaller seedlings. Compared to the control, planted A. viridis had a neutral effect on S. alaxensis and inhibited P. balsamifera at the seedling establishment stage, but facilitated the growth of established plants of both species, with many plants overtopping the A. viridis canopy. Compared to the control, S. alaxensis plants in the Alnus treatment had higher levels of foliar N and 
40305828|The role of backcountry huts as introduction points for the establishment and spread of non-native plants into remote natural areas has received little attention. We surveyed soil and vegetation around 25 backcountry huts in the subalpine landscape of the Australian Alps to examine the role that such huts play in acting as foci for invasion by non-native species into remote mountain areas. We found that the hut surroundings were characterized by greater soil compaction, lower vegetation height, and more bare ground relative to the native plant community located 100 m from huts. At the landscape-scale, a total of 32 non-native species were recorded within 100 m of huts. Seven species were found at greater than 50% of huts (Hypochoeris radicata, Taraxacum officinale, Acetosella vulgar is, Trifolium repens, Cerastium glomeratum, Agrostis capillaris, Poa annua), and these tended to be the species that have (a) been long-established (> 50100 yrs) and (b) are the most frequent in the broader landscape. Hence, huts act to promote these ruderals by providing opportunities for their establishment, but such opportunities are not confined to hut surroundings. Several other non-native species, however, were common around huts but largely absent from the wider landscape (e.g. Anthoxanthum odoratum, Plantago major, Polygonum aviculare, Stellaria media). This suggests that some species are advantaged by the disturbance and dispersal opportunities provided by hut recreational activities in a way that is not catered for elsewhere in the Australian Alps. A weak negative relationship between non-native species richness and increasing altitude was found, but native species richness and distance of hut from access road were poor predictors of non-native species richness. Our study highlights that recreational activities may provide opportunities for the establishment of nonnative plant species in remote high mountain areas, some of which are novel to the landscape, and that these may form the basis for further invasion into adjoining native vegetation.
1552575|We used integrated multiproxy analysis of a lake sediment core and glacial geomorphology to reconstruct the late Pleistocene and Holocene climate and geomorphic evolution of the Burstall Pass area, Kananaskis Country, Alberta, Canada. Analysis of macrofossils, pollen, sedimentology, and sediment geochemistry from a lake sediment core and geomorphology and tephrochronology of glacial moraines provide evidence for multiple modes of climate during the last ca. 11,000 yr. An advance of the Robertson Glacier prior to ca. 9200 <sup>14</sup>C BP is correlated to the Crowfoot advance and was the largest of the postglacial period. Immediately following this event, increased lake productivity and the deposition of marl as well as increased arboreal/nonarboreal pollen (AP/NAP) ratios suggest that the climate warmed, possibly accompanied by increased aridity. Decreased turbidity and clastic sediment flux in Lower Burstall Lake during the early Holocene suggest reduced glacial runoff and may indicate the complete ablation of the Robertson Glacier shortly after 10,000 <sup>14</sup>C BP. Clastic sediment flux to Lower Burstall Lake remained minimal until after ca. 3500 <sup>14</sup>C BP, when decreasing LOI (loss-on-ignition) organic carbon levels in lake sediments signaled the return of glacial runoff to the lake system. The largest Neoglacial advance in the Burstall Pass area appears to have been the most recent and was followed by rapid recession during the 20th century.
24551627|Low nitrogen (N) supply is a limiting factor for plant growth in most terrestrial ecosystems. N-fixing legumes therefore have the potential to facilitate surrounding vegetation by increasing soil N levels. This effect should be especially pronounced in low-productivity habitats where ambient soil N levels are low, such as in alpine areas. We examined whether plant species composition, community diversity measures, and soil N levels differed with and without the presence of two alpine legumes, Oxytropis lapponica (Wahlenb.) Gay and Astragalus alpinus L., in a Dryas octopetala heath at Finse, Norway. Species composition and richness differed between plots with and without Oxytropis in one of two study sites, as other plant species were positively associated with the legume. None of the measured community properties differed between plots with and without the presence of Astragalus. The contrasting influence of the two legume species corresponds to our findings of higher soil N levels below Oxytropis, but not Astragalus. Differences in microhabitat N levels may explain why only Oxytropis acts as a facilitator. By affecting local species composition Oxytropis increases spatial heterogeneity, which may increase total species richness of the ecosystem.
1552353|Nitrogen (N) deposition has been implicated in changes in surface water chemistry and algal composition in several dilute mountain lakes of the western United States. Lakes of the Snowy Range (Medicine Bow National Forest, Wyoming) appear to have low nitrate concentrations currently, and 2 Snowy Range lakes showed strong eutrophication responses to N or N + phosphorus (P) additions in previous enclosure experiments. In this study, we explored the regional extent of phytoplankton N limitation by examining a nutrient ratio index (dissolved inorganic nitrogen:total phosphorus) and phytoplankton species-environment relationships across 15 Snowy Range lakes. Based on this index, we estimate that phytoplankton biomass in the study lakes is largely N limited or N + P colimited. In addition, redundancy analysis demonstrated strong relationships between phytoplankton species composition and N gradients, with chrysophyte taxa favored in low-N lakes and cyanophytes and chlorophytes favored in higher-N lakes. We conclude that both phytoplankton biomass and community structure are sensitive indicators of N gradients in lakes of the Snowy Range, and that eutrophication responses to future increases in N loading could be widespread in these and other low-N lakes.
4095943|The aim of this study was to assess the influence of comparable unequal environmental conditions on primary vegetation succession in an alpine glacier valley by the means of transects. Two longitudinal transects were established along the glacier foreland of the Rotmoosferner, Tyrol, Austria, and two transverse transects were established across the valley on the 1923 and 1858 moraines. The progressions of alpha- and beta-diversity were compared, and vegetation data within the glacier foreland were analyzed. Moraine age emerged as the primary factor within a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), while the second axis separated the two valley sides. A clearly differentiated development of plant communities became obvious especially within the early development stages. Early development of vegetation cover and alpha diversity was further developed on the shaded valley side, and progression of beta diversity differed significantly among the valley sides. The results indicate two different successional pathways, on both the qualitative and the quantitative level. These can be attributed to differences in the extent of solar irradiation (sunny vs. shaded side), lithology, geomorphic processes, and a multitude of other factors, reinforcing the dissimilarity between the valley sides. Our approach highlights the necessity of a deliberate sampling design within different glacier forelands sensitive to environmental conditions created by the topography that may impact comparisons among the forelands.
40305820|The Arctic is extremely vulnerable to projected climate change, and global warming may result in major community reorganizations. The aim of this study was a thorough investigation of plant biomass production throughout an entire growing season in five different high arctic vegetation types: Cassiope, Dryas, and Salix heath, grassland, and fen. The main focus was on the gross ecosystem production (GEP), and the biotic and abiotic factors which may influence GEP. Photosynthesis, aboveground biomass, and carbon, nitrogen, and chlorophyll content were measured weekly during nine weeks. There were large differences in seasonal growth and production within and among vegetation types. Mosses contributed considerably to the total C and N pool in grassland, fen, and Salix heath. Fen, which had the highest pool of leaf N, leaf chlorophyll, and moss N, was the most productive vegetation type in terms of GEP, despite the lowest total biomass. Across vegetation types, leaf biomass, leaf N, and moss N pool size influenced GEP. Within most vegetation types GEP correlated with leaf N, in correspondence with the notion that N may limit plant production in many high arctic ecosystems. The timing of the peaks in C and N pools in leaves did not coincide with that in the mosses and in woody tissues. This emphasizes the importance of sampling throughout the growing season, when using field data from the Arctic to estimate plant biomasses and modeling C and N fluxes and pool sizes.
4095849|Holocene lake and catchment environmental history and regional climate are reconstructed from lake sediments at
10.2307/1552549|Forty-four lakes in the Austrian Alps were studied to examine the influence of catchment characteristics on water chemistry. The lakes are located along an altitudinal gradient (1502-2309 m a.s.l.) in a small study area (35.5 km * 15.5 km) without glaciers. Longitude and latitude accounted for 21.4% of the variation in water chemistry. Bedrock mineralogy explained 14.5% of the variation. Vegetation accounted for 13.2% and slope for 5.5% of the variation in water chemistry. No correlations were found between exposure and water chemistry. Water chemistry appeared to be mainly determined by (1) chemical weathering of carbonate minerals and (2) in-lake productivity. Carbonate minerals were assumed to be present in all watersheds. Trees and shrubs enhanced chemical weathering. Concentrations of chemical parameters indicating physical weathering were high in lakes with large, steep catchments. Steep watersheds were correlated with enhanced nitrogen concentrations in the lakes. In-lake productivity obscured relationships between chemical parameters and catchment characteristics. Nonetheless, catchment characteristics explained 45% of the variation in water chemistry, stressing their importance for water chemistry in mountain lakes.
