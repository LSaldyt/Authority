Die steile sdliche Seite des Berges ist von Quercus virgiliana bedeckt. In den Felsenrasen des Dolomites sind Sesleria hungarica und Carex humilis herschend. Im Frhjahrsaspekt sind stellenweise die kleinerengraseren Gruppen von Daphne cneorum charakteristisch. Das Gebiet ist ein vorteilhafter Fundort von Cypripedium calceolus, aus dem vir etwa 150-200 Exemplare zhlten. Die beilegende Florenliste und die znologische Aufnahmen zeigen die Zusammensetzung der Assoziation. Deren Grund schlagen wir vor dass man die Assoziation von den bekannten Eichen-Pflanzengesellsohaft ale Sesalerio-Quercetum virgilianae Assoziation unterscheiden soll.
43519465|The Bugac area includes several very different habitat types so that some characteristic fungi of coastal sand dunes, deserts, steppes, alder swamps and planted Robinia and Pinus stands occur together. The extremely arid climate causes other species to be found very rarely. This paper summarizes the mycological observations of the author performed since 1965. The list is probably not exhaustive as records of many additional species may be expected in the near future.
43519452|In recent years several studies have reported on chironomid production. The purpose of my paper is to evaluate the theoretical and practical aspects of the problems associated with the experimental investigations on chironomids, more specifically on Chironomus balatonicus, and to propose some solutions. A definition for biological production was selected from the traditional statements, which served as a basis for my study, then a new approach from cybernetical aspect is suggested. I consider eight tasks which are necessary to understand the importance of a quantitatively dominant species in the life of a water-body; these are the following: 1) Investigation of the complete life cycle under laboratory conditions. 2) Estimation of the production of one generation on the basis of breeding experiments. 3) Determination of the number of generations in a water-body. 4) The possibilities and ways of extrapolation from breeding results. 5) To establish the survival strategy and to estimate the elimination. 6) Estimation of the total production of the species in a water-body. 7) Possibilities for estimating the quantity of consumed nutrients. 8) Quantitative evaluation of the role of chironomids in matter circulation and in the energy budget of a water-body.
43518934|Adjacent patches of different community types interact with each other via the efflux of individuals of component populations, influenced by the size, shape, arrangement and distance of patches. In a spatial micromosaic of two vegetation types, it is reasonable to assume that the intensity of interactions is proportional to the distances between patches (more precisely, to the distribution of distances). In this paper, a special type of distance distribution functions (DDF) is introduced to predict potential interactions between two communities. Each community is characterised by two functions (i. e., comm. A - comm.  and comm.  -> comm. A). The applicability of the new function is presented in the evaluation of a vegetation map.
43519245|Net CO assimilation (A), transpiration (E) and water use efficiency (WUE) were compared in two C grasses and two C dicot herbs of a xeric temperate loess steppe after exposure in open top chambers for 1, 2, 11 and 36 months to present (350 mol mol, LCO) and elevated (700 mol mol, HCO) levels of CO. Acclimation of A to elevated CO varied both between species and over the course of the period of exposure. In the first month of exposure photosynthesis of Festuca rupicola grown at elevated CO concentration showed a significant upward regulation. Salvia nemorosa did not show acclimation of photosynthesis after the first month of exposure. After the 2nd month of exposure, F. rupicola maintained its upward acclimation. S. nemorosa also showed upward acclimation of net photosynthesis both in the initial slope and the plateau of the CO assimilation vs intercellular CO concentration (A/ci) curve. After 11 months of exposure, the grasses displayed a downward acclimation in the decreased initial slope of the A/ci response curve and similar A at high CO concentrations in plants grown at high CO concentartion (HCO plants). Transpiration decreased with an increase of Ci in the grass species, while in the dicot species it was not affected by any change in Ci. Long term exposure to high CO causes a similar acclimation of stomatal regulation and transpiration to that of photosynthesis. Instantaneous WUE significantly increased in all species grown at elevated CO. After 36 months of exposure the monocot species showed a downward acclimation in Rubisco capacity and its A/ci curve did not reach saturation. The dicot species showed upregulation regarding either the Rubisco capacity or Pi/RuBP regeneration capacity. In the short term, monocot species are more responsive than the dicot ones. Further, acclimation of photosynthesis in Pi/RuBP regeneration capacity is an earlier response than that of Rubisco activity/amount. In the long term, HCO treatment caused alleviation of the Pi regeneration limitation at high CO concentrations, while in LCO plants the A/ci curve showed saturation in all of the species. Species responded at different time scales and in different ways to exposure to HCO treatments. The grass species responded earlier and maintained their response characteristics after the first month of exposure, while the dicot species responded later and their response characteristics changed with the advance of exposure to HCO treatment. These differences can partly be attributed to probable sink limitation in the monocot species, which was apparently absent or smaller in the dicots.
43519439|The relationship between climatic ordinations and the geographic position of meteorological stations has been studied via Procrustes analysis in order to measure the effects of some geographic features on climatic variation within phytoclimatic zones of China. The analysis showed that for nearly all phytoclimatic zones there is a high correspondence between the position of the metereological stations in multidimensional climatic space and in the territory. This means that the climatic variation follows a regular pattern in the territories of phytoclimatic zones. However, multiple regression confirmed that Procrustes measures of dissimilarity within each zone are significantly correlated with the standard deviation of altitude and the number of rivers of that zone. This indicates that these two geographic features affect the pattern of climatic variation.
