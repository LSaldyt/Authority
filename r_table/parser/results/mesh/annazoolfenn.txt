23737160|In polygynous species, male reproductive effort has been measured both directly in the form of somatic costs and indirectly using behavioral data. We used 12 years of data collected from a semi-domesticated reindeer population in northern Finland to investigate age- and time-specific patterns of dominant males' reproductive effort. Overall, we found that activity levels differed both between young and old dominant reindeer males, and among the early, peak, and late rut, the pattern being age-specific. Reproductive effort was generally higher for old than young dominant males; however, old males reduced their effort in the late-rut period, while young males maintained the same level of activity. There was a positive relationship between somatic costs and activity level only during the early rut for young dominant males, and only during the peak rut for old dominant males. Thus, old males incur the highest energetic costs from rut-related activities when most of the females in the herd are in oestrus. Conversely, young males appear to time their rut-related energetic cost to coincide with the early rutting period, before most females have reached oestrus. Old males are more efficient in timing their reproductive effort so as to maximize their reproductive success. This can be attributed to young males being less experienced than old males or to using an alternative mating tactic by young males who try to avoid competition with old males during the peak rut.
23736841|A fast, inexpensive, and reliable method for sex determination of giant panda was developed using amplification of giant panda zinc finger alleles (ZFX/ZFY). Two sets of primers targeted a conserved region in the exon of the ZFX/ZFY genes worked in a single PCR process, and provided positive results for both males and females. Sexes of individuals were revealed by sex-specific banding patterns (females: 447 bp, 146 bp; males: 447 bp, 350 bp, 146 bp). This method was successfully tested on blood sample from pandas of known sex. Non-invasive tests revealed that this method can also be applied to non-invasive samples such as hair or feces.
23736796|We studied the relationship between landscape composition and capercaillie density in 50 km  50 km grids in Finland, where modern forestry started in the 1950s and most of the forests are in commercial use. Capercaillie density was positively associated with the young thinning stand proportion throughout the country, but unlike in numerous older studies, it wasn't positively associated with the mature stand proportion in any part of the country. In central Finland this relationship was even negative. In central and southern Finland capercaillie density was associated positively with the forest land proportion, and negatively with the open area proportion. Results suggest that the overall amount of the forest cover is important for the capercaillie, and that clear-cut areas in the 1950s and 1960s, known as 'large age classes', have developed as suitable for them. A new aspect based on results is the potential reduction in the mature forest quality as capercaillie habitats.
23735528|We livetrapped enclosed field vole populations with either familiar or unfamiliar founder females in a twofold replicated experiment. The familiar females were kept together in small arenas for two months before the experiment. The unfamiliar ones had no former experience of each other. Home range size, nearest neighbour distance and the behaviour towards other breeding females was similar between the treatments. The same was true for the number of recruits produced, maturation rate and persistence probabilities. Our results suggest that familiarity between breeding females has no important effects in Microtus agrestis.
23735586|Variation in animal numbers is an interesting ecological problem in both theoretical and applied research. Recent research has shown that there is a myriad of problems involved in measuring variability in animal populations, which have not been addressed in most empirical studies on fluctuations of animal densities. Therefore, we actually know less about variability in animal populations and communities than we think. It is rarely possible to accurately sample entire populations and our estimates of variability usually come from spatially restricted samples of counts drawn from local populations. The observed variability not only reflects variability in population density or size but also involves a sampling variance component. Sampling variance occurs principally due to inexactness of the counts (i.e. all individuals present in the sampling unit do not enter into samples) and spatial variance (the size of the sampling unit is inadequate to capture the dispersion pattern of individuals in the field). Many samples are affected by both of these sources of error and in most cases we are unable to separate their effects. Sampling variance usually affects the variability estimates and particularly besets small samples. When comparisons are to be made in temporal variability between communities, species, populations or sites, great care must be taken to mitigate the effects of sampling variance. If the counts are replicated in space or time then sampling error can fairly simply be estimated and removed. Even in the absence of replication, statistical methods exist allowing estimation of the sampling variance. These methods are only applicable if we are prepared to make assumptions about the distributions of the counts. We exemplify one of these methods by considering a classical case of latitudinal gradients in density variability in animal communities. We finally discuss recent studies, the results of which might be artefacts arising from sampling variance.
23735755|Sexual selection in black grouse was studied through multivariate analyses of possible correlates of mating success using data from an eight year study of 10 different leks. Body size was weakly correlated with mating status (0 or  1 mating) and tail length was significantly correlated with mating success (total number of copulations) even after controlling for the effects of age and body size. Among several behavioural variables, having a high attendance, being more active and having the tail feathers lyre-erected more often were significantly related to high mating success also when age and the other factors were controlled for. In addition, there were strong relationship between a combined measure of territorial centrality and territory size and their interaction such that males that held relatively large central territories had higher mating success. Males that spent more time rookooing (display) had lower mating success. This last somewhat counter-intuitive result could be explained by a significant interaction between rookoo and centrality; central and successful males were engaged in more interactions with neighbours, and therefore were not allowed to display as often as peripheral unsuccessful males. Display activity indeed turned out to be a significant factor of mating success when we controlled for territory position. All of the significant variables are likely to reflect male motivation and/or competence. The results thus indicate that successful males are signified by being healthy, active and capable to defend relatively large central territories on the leks. We conclude that sexual selection in black grouse is most likely mediated both by male-male competition and female preference.
23736114|The distribution and migration patterns of overwintering perch were studied by hydroacoustics and gill netting in Lake Constance, central Europe. In autumn, perch left the littoral and moved to deeper waters for overwintering. They lived at temperatures below 6C for about six months. In January, perch were present between the 42 and 69 m depth contours. Their distribution then shifted to increasingly shallower depths by 0.25 m per day, and they returned to the littoral in early May where adults spawned in late May. During winter, perch performed diel vertical migrations, resting on the bottom during day and swimming up to 25 m off the bottom during night. Light was the proximate cause of this regular vertical migration. Perch did not gain an energetic advantage by migrating in a homothermal water column, but they may have gained access to copepods in addition to their main diet of benthic invertebrates. It is hypothesized that predator avoidance is the ultimate cause of diel migration in overwintering perch which avoid piscivorous birds by resting on the bottom during day and avoid burbot by swimming off the bottom during night.
23736187|Remains of Coregonus sp. were obtained from the collection of archeological materials found in 1991 at the site Wola Grzymalina, Poland. DNA has been extracted from vertebrae that were dated about 500 000 years old. Polymerase chain reactions on extracts from the vertebral remains were succesful only using primers that targeted nucleotide sequences that were not longer than about 100bp. The ancient nucleotide sequence of a 102bp fragment of mitochondrial DNA ND1 gene matched the contemporary sequence of European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) and differed from that of vendace (C. albula) by four substitutions. Ambiguous nucleotides were observed at nine positions throughout the 87bp fragment of mtDNA control region (CR), nonetheless the sequence was different from that of vendace by eight additional changes. Phylogenetic analysis utilizing Bayesian inference placed the archival sequence into a clade with European whitefish. The support for this reconstruction was f(|X) = 0.65 after analysis of the ND1 fragment and f(|X) = 0.52 after analysis of the CR fragment. Excellent preservation of the specimen analysed in this study proves the potential for analysing genetic characteristics of species and specimens that are thousands of years old.
23735686|Nutritional components of individual plant species such as protein, nonstructural carbohydrates, neutral detergent fibers and total phenolics are commonly used to assess the quality of vole habitats and food selection. Although voles act individually on each plant species of their habitat, I question the use of such variables for following habitat manipulation by this small herbivore after a summer of grazing. I tested the reliability of using chemical analyses of green biomass from quadrat samples, and fecal matter of meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) for determining changes in habitat quality and food quality by confined animals. Voles were introduced into fenced plots during early summer and reached peak numbers of 350 animals/ha. Green biomass did not vary among the grazed plots, nor between grazed and ungrazed (control) plots after a summer of grazing activity. Chemical components of green biomass did not differ significantly between grazed and ungrazed plots. As a whole, green biomass samples were unreliable for detecting habitat quality changes after vole grazing. Food habit determinations from fecal remains showed that five herbaceous species were selected by confined voles. Moreover, fecal matter contained significantly more carbohydrates, total phenolics, and neutral detergent fibers in the heavily grazed plot compared with samples collected in lightly grazed areas, indicating that consequences of heavy grazing could be detected from such analyses. I conclude that chemical analyses of fecal matter rather than green biomass represent a better way of measuring out changes in food quality of vole habitats. Further studies are needed to know which categories of animals make up the fecal dropping samples in the field, and how much information is lost when samples are collected directly from animals or on bi-weekly or monthly schedules from dropping boards.
23732269|The respiration rhythm of hibernating hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus L.) was studied during experiments in which the composition of the inspired gas was varied in respect of CO2 and O2 concentrations. Body temperature was recorded in an ambient temperature of 4.2 ( 0.5 C). The apnoeic periods became shorter when the CO2 concentration in the inspired gas reached about 1 %, and disappeared completely when it exceeded 5 %. A decrease in O2 concentration affected the respiration rhythm by shortening the apnoeic periods when the O2 concentration was less than 16 %. Respiration became continuous at O2 concentrations of 2  3 %.
23736033|The article summarizes observations of relict malacostracan species made mainly in the lake region of Finland. In addition to geographical location, maximum depth, lake area and altitude, human activity also has an effect on the occurrence of given species. Pontoporeia affinis seems to be the most sensitive to human interference, and this and Pallasea quadrispinosa, which is not as sensitive, have returned to areas in Lake Pijnne that were earlier more polluted. Mysis relicta has the widest environmental amplitude in different lakes, while Gammaracanthus lacustris occurs only in largest, deepest and cleanest lakes. Pallasea should be included in the fauna of the Baltic. The question is raised of whether the concept of relict species should be broadened to include also some other cold-stenotherm species, in particular certain calanoids, harpacticoids and rotifers, and also meiobenthic species. It seems that at least Pallasea might be able to immigrate to areas situated higher up. The reason for the absence of Saduria entomon in the large lakes of Finland has not been ascertained, and the advantages and disadvantages attached to transferring it and comparable relict or other species are not generally known in sufficient detail.
23735690|Chromosomes of two populations of the common shrew, Sorex araneus L. (Mammalia, Insectivora, Soricidae), from the northern Ural Mts. were investigated. In both sites, homozygous, all-metacentric autosomal complements were revealed, with the autosomal arm combinations af, bc, go, hn, ip, jl, km, qr, tu. This karyotype is identical to that predicted by Halkka et al. (1994) as the hypothetical "Old-Northern" race connecting the northern and eastern ratial groups of Sorex araneus in Eurasia.
23736967|Distribution data on beaver populations thriving in central Poland are common. We modelled beaver population viability to assess the current status and threats to the beaver in the 135-km-long section of the Vistula valley. We simulated different densities of expanding beaver populations and evaluated the three most significant scenarios of potential developments in the valley with the LARCH habitat model. The model output indicated higher vulnerability of low density populations to the same environmental changes. At present, suitable habitats sustain a large minimum viable population as part of one sustainable network. Hypothetical construction of two dams and removal of riparian forests within dykes would lead toa 25% reduction in population size. In contrast, river renaturalisation would increase beaver numbers by 42%. Based on the population trends we conclude that scenario analysis is beneficial in helping to evaluate future management decisions.
23734130|The study represented an attempt to clarify whether goldfish, after rearing in monochromatic light, show deviations from normal in their colour discrimination ability. Goldfish were made to spawn, the spawn then being distributed to three rearing basins which were illuminated with red (687 nm), blue (434 nm), or white, light. After 14-19 months, fish of all groups were tested for their colour discrimination ability by means of blue-green and red-green discrimination training. No significant differences between the rearing groups were found. Further, for fish of all rearing groups, blue-green discrimination was significantly more difficult than red-green discrimination. Spontaneous colour preferences were not observed. Neither did lightmicroscopic investigation of the retinae reveal differences  the shape and pattern of distribution of the discernible cone types were the same in all groups and corresponded to the descriptions given by other authors.
23731375|Numerous specimens of Polydora redeki Horst are recorded from the SW coast of Finland, from an area where the salinity is about 6 %. This is the northernmost locality known for this polychaete in the Baltic. Some features of the morphology, distribution and habitats of the species are discussed.
23731714|In the winters of 1968/69 - 1972/73, the ecology of the red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris L.) was studied in the Vrritunturi fell terrain, northeastern Finnish Lapland. A transect survey indicated that the density of the population fluctuated irregularly. No evidence of irregular migrations of squirrels was obtained. Most of the squirrel tracks were recorded in mixed or pure spruce forests. Of the 74 squirrels' nests studied, 42 % were on Scots pines and 58 % on spruces. On pines 87 % of the nests were between 6 and 18 m, and on spruces 84 % between 3.5 and 8 m above the ground. 97 % of the nests were against the main trunk. 77 % of them were on the southeastern, southern and southwestern sides of the trunks. Beard moss and small pieces of branches and shoots of conifers were the main building material. After a warming phase of 10 - 30 minutes squirrels could maintain a nest temperature which was 20 - 30 C higher than the ambient air temperature. In winter 1972, spruce seeds were the main food of the squirrels, and in winter 1972/73, pine seeds. In the latter winter, the nutritive value of the pine seeds was much higher than that of the local spruce seeds and also higher than that of other spruce seed samples studied. The mobility of the squirrel was at its minimum during the shortest days and the coldest months of the year. The activity pattern differed very clearly from that of the pine marten (Martes martes L.).
23734630|The material consists of 11 otters found dead in Central Finland in the 1980s. The concentrations of many hazardous chemicals were low in the fresh weight of liver: alfa- and oxychlordane, HCB, lindane, DDT, DDD, DDE, PCB and dieldrin. The maximum value was 2.5 ppm of PCB. However, the lipid contents were higher, being on an average 2914 ppm (maximum 150) of PCB. Mirex and toxaphene were not detected using a minimum detection level of one ng/g (=0.001 ppm). The effect of the Chernobyl power plant explosion in spring 1986, 1300 km SSE of the study area, can be clearly seen in increased cesium contents. The residues of chemicals were not higher in the older animals.
23733737|The daily food consumption of the three-spined stickleback at different temperatures was calculated from determinations of the rate of digestion. The rate of digestion in fish which had taken food in the sea before being caught was compared with that of fish fed in the laboratory either with Daphnia or with plankton collected from the sea. Owing to seasonal differences in the food available in nature, determination of the digestion rate in fish that had taken food under natural conditions was found to give a better estimate of the actual food consumption of the three-spined stickleback than feeding experiments. In fish averaging 1.0 g fr.wt. the daily food consumption so calculated was 24.27.8 mg (2.4 % of the body fr.wt.) at 10 C, 48,316.3 mg (4.8 %) at 14 C, and 132.828.8 mg (13.3 %) at 18 C. In fish averaging 1.6 g the respective rates were 100.239.7 mg (6.2 %), 186.250.4 mg (11.6 %) and 271.250.4 mg (16.9 %).
23734566|The anterior and posterior pileus in 367 specimens of the common lizard Lacerta vivipara, collected mainly in southern Finland, show different types of variation: geographical in the anterior and largely stochastic in the posterior. This variation was studied in terms of phenodeviants indicatory of disturbances caused by environmental or genetic stresses during ontogeny, with the following results: 1) the differences in the anterior pileus pattern are probably hereditary, 2) the viabilities of the pileus types vary in different environmental conditions, 3) the postfrontal anomalies are much more common among individuals with a particular pattern called "rectangular" than among the other types, the former thus possibly being connected with some specific system of disturbance particularly susceptible to anomalies, and 4) it seems evident that there are genetically determined interrelations between the anterior and posterior part of the pileus through the mediatory role of the rectangular pattern. The problem is treated in terms of phenodeviants indicating disturbances caused by environmental or genetic stresses during ontogeny.
23734571|The antipredatory behaviour of bank voles Clethrionomys glareolus and prey choice of weasels Mustela nivalis were investigated in a seminatural enclosure. Bank voles were observed for three consecutive days. During the second day a weasel was present in the enclosure. The daily activity rhythm of voles without predation risk was characterized by inactivity at nights with pronounced peaks at dawn. When the weasel was present in the pen, vole activity occurred throughout the day. When endangered by a predator, bank voles dramatically increased their above-ground mobility. At the same time, intraspecific aggressiveness decreased. Adult voles were less vulnerable than young ones to weasel predation. In three hunting sessions with different enclosed populations of bank voles, weasels primarily killed young voles.
23736896|Plant responses to mammalian herbivores can be manifold. Browsing by large mammals such as moose may change plant growth and morphology, which, in turn, will change the food quality and availability for e.g. invertebrate herbivores sharing the same forage plant. Furthermore, the intensity and timing of herbivory may affect plant responses and future herbivore attack. In a field experiment, we tested whether simulated summer browsing and natural winter browsing by moose affects growth and morphology of birch Betula pendula, and whether possible changes had effects on abundance and defoliation by herbivorous invertebrates. The simulated summer browsing treatment was applied in two intensities (50% and 100% defoliation of long shoots) during two different periods of the growth season (mid-June and mid-July). Simulated summer browsing delayed the timing of budburst, reduced height and diameter growth and resulted in reduced defoliation by invertebrate herbivores indicating an induced defence. Winter browsing by moose reduced diameter growth, leaf biomass of short shoots but increased height growth, the abundance of aphids and defoliation by insect herbivores. The effects of herbivory on the timing of budburst, leaf biomass of long and short shoots and the abundance of aphids were more pronounced when the birches were both browsed in winter and artificially stripped. The timing of the artificial leaf stripping treatment was important for nearly all tested variables. Concluding, summer and winter browsing by moose can have opposing or additive effects on plant morphology and growth. Therefore, also indirect effects of mammalian herbivory on invertebrate communities feeding on the same plant may differ, depending on the browsing intensity, the season of browsing and even the timing of browsing within the same season.
23736200|About 6 million one-summer-old, fluorescent pigment marked whitefish were released in the northern and central parts of the Gulf of Bothnia in 19951998. Growth and dispersal of the stocked fish were followed by detecting and recording marked whitefish in samples from the professional fisheries catch during 19992002. The yield produced by stocked fish was estimated by assuming that the proportion of the marked fish in the total catch was the same as in the samples. The total yield from the stockings in 1995 was estimated to be 5590 kg/1000 released fingerlings. A better result from the stockings could be achieved by increasing the recruitment size in the fishery. Even for the 1995 stockings, a few of the released fish were probably still migrating in the sea at the end of the study period, although the main part had already been caught. For fish released in 1996 or later, no exact estimates of total yield can be given, as a considerable part of the catch was still to come. The estimates from the preliminary re-catches, however, suggest that the stockings in northern parts produce lower catches than stockings in central parts of the Gulf of Bothnia.
23731763|Marks made by a wolverine to establish its territory were recorded in 26 places along a track 7.5 km long in the Vrritunturi fell terrain, NE Finnish Lapland. One urination and 26 markings with secretion from anal glands had been made on coniferous bushes and trees, stones, a tussock and a dry stick.
23736008|The behaviour of smooth newt adult females foraging on Daphnia was analysed. Newts were given different-sized Daphnia (1.5, 2.3 and 3.8 mm), either as one-sized or two-sized prey in different densities and size ratios. The frequency distribution of angles of turns mede by newts between discrete moves during foraging bouts is a normal function peaking at approx. 0. Increasing prey abundance or size of prey made newts turn more widely during their foraging bouts. The movements of newts during foraging bouts are directional (i.e., moving straight ahead dominates) with the exception that the first turn made after ingestion of a prey tends to be a wider arc than subsequent turns. In other words, newts move straight ahead before capturing a prey, but make random turns just after capturing the prey. A computer simulation with aggregated prey suggests that a "directional-random' turning rule (observed newt behaviour) gives the highest prey capture rate when compared to "directional-directional' (second best) or "random-random' turning rules.
23734485|Diel feeding activity in an enclosed cyclic population of the bank vole Clethrionomys glareolus was studied during an increase and peak year in 198385. An automatic camera at a feeding station was used. The population was also live trapped monthly to follow its demography. The individual voles visited the feeding station most often during spring and autumn, which was obviously due to nutritive reasons. On the population level a polyphasic and irregular activity rhythm was the main pattern observed. However, when all observations during both years were pooled a rather uniform activity pattern could be recognized over the whole 24-hour period during summer, a diurnal activity pattern during autumn and winter and a nocturnal pattern during spring. During the breeding season the activity of the juveniles and subadults was much higher than that of the adult individuals. The juveniles often moved in groups of two to four individuals  these groups obviously consisted of siblings. During spring, after the onset of reproduction, the feeding activity patterns of adult individuals seemed to differ from the patterns of juveniles and subadults. The feeding activity rhythm of young individuals may be more flexible than that of old ones and constitute one reason for the rather uniform activity pattern during summer. The results do not exclude the possibility that different social groups may have different diel feeding activity rhythms.
23736177|Rejection of parasitic eggs is one of the most important adaptations of avian hosts against brood parasites. Multiple brood parasitism is relatively rare in hosts of the common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus), but naturally occurs when the rate of parasitism is high. We experimentally parasitised great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) clutches with non-mimetic and moderately mimetic model cuckoo eggs. In the case of single parasitism, each egg type was rejected at the same rate (68%75%), but in the case of multiple parasitism, the rejection rate significantly increased to 96%. So multiple parasitism is in some way facilitating anti-parasite behaviour in the host. We suggest that when parasitism rate reaches high levels, e.g. at the beginning of the coevolutionary arms race, multiple parasitism may be an important component of the host's adaptation to brood parasitism in general.
23734418|The suitability of four asymptotic growth equations for describing growth of length in populations of Anodonta piscinalis was studied. The Krger function showed the best fit with the observed values, but the other three equations (von Bertanlanffy, Gompertz, logistic) were not much worse. The Krger function was also the best when lengths of very old and young individuals were extrapolated from truncated data. Although the equations closely simulated the sets of material, we could find little evidence that their parameters (growth constant, asymptotic length) were suitable for comparisons between populations. Different cohorts and sexes within a population produced very variable numerical values for these parameters. The correlation between the mean length of the third annulus in a population and the growth constant produced by different equations for the same set of data ranged from 0.539 to 0.640. The von Bertanlanffy equation was the least unsuitable for producing parameters for comparisons between populations.
23735721|Biodiversity conservation in Finland has developed from old hunting and forest-use regulations towards habitat conservation based on ecological research and international agreements on protection of wildlife. Hunting of game animals and persecution of species considered as pests have been legally regulated in Finland since the Middle Ages. The first attempts to control forest destruction date back to the 1600s. Banning of spring hunting of waterfowl was suggested already in 1769. The rise of "modern" nature conservation in the late 1800s was apparently influenced by the European bird conservation movement (introduced to Finland in 1870 by Z. Topelius), the widespread criticism towards the 1898 Hunting Decree, and the growing interest towards conservation issues among biology and forestry professionals, inspired by an article published by A. E. Nordenskild. Already in the 1800s both hunting/persecution and habitat changes were perceived as threats to wildlife. The Nature Conservation Act, which became the cornerstone for Finnish conservation policy, was enacted in 1923. In the 20th century the numbers of protected species and conservation areas have increased. For more than a century Finnish conservationists have participated in international conservation efforts, in which Finland now participates as a member of the European Community.
23736807|Altering environmental conditions affects the genetic composition of populations via demographic and selective responses by creating of variety of population substructuring types. Classical genetic approaches can predict the genetic composition of populations under long-term or structurally stable conditions, but exclude factors such as animal behaviour, environmental structure, and breeding biology, all of which influence genetic diversity. Most populations are unique in some of these characteristics, and therefore may be unsuitable for the classical approach. Here, an alternative approach using a genetically explicit individual-based model (IBM) coupled to a dynamic landscape model was used to obtain measures for the genetic status of simulated vole populations. The rate of loss of expected heterozygosity (He) was calculated for simulated populations using two levels of spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Results showed that both spatial and temporal heterogeneity exerted an influence on the rate of loss of genetic diversity, but the precise effect was a balance between the effects of population sub-structuring, the frequency of founder effects and population size. These were in turn related to habitat availability and their influence on vole behaviour. Interaction between spatial and temporal dynamics altered the ratio of effective population size to census size. This indicates an altered reproductive potential, crucial in conservation biology applications. However, when the loss of heterozygosity was corrected for the harmonic mean of the population size, the rate of loss was almost identical in the four scenarios. Unlike classical genetic models, IBMs are flexible enough to mimic real population processes under a range of environmental and behavioural conditions. We conclude that IBMs incorporating explicit genetics provide a promising new approach to the evaluation of the effect of animal behaviour, and random and man-induced events on the genetic composition of populations. They also provide a new platform from which to investigate the implication of real world deviations from assumptions of traditional genetic models.
23736049|In shallow, northern Baltic archipelago waters, predatory epibenthic invertebrates are rare in relation to fully marine environments. One such predator is the relict isopod Saduria entomon L., which is faced with a choice of prey organisms of varying ecological origin, including marine or estuarine species on the one hand, and "limnic" species on the other. In clearly sublittoral areas S. entomon has no principal invertebrate competitors for food, but in shallow water regions odonata larvae may play a similar regulatory role on the benthic community. Against this background, the structuring role of S. entomon for the benthic infauna in shallow brackish waters was tested in relation to (a) one major invertebrate food competitor (Libellula quadrimaculata; Odonata), and (b) prey species of varying ecological origin (marine or estuarine, exemplified by Macoma balthica and Corophium volutator, and "limnic", e.g. Asellus aquaticus and larval chironomids). Field and aquarium experiments illustrated that S. entomon is technically capable by predation to exhibit a regulatory pressure on all prey items offered, but that the effects at community level are difficult to distinguish from the natural variation within the ecosystem. On shallow bottoms S. entomon exhibits similar predatory effects to the larvae of the dragonfly L. quadrimaculata. It is concluded that S. entomon in shallow Baltic archipelagoes is something of a "universal competitor", capable of affecting populations regardless of their functional origin.
23736697|The phylogeography of north European anadromous and non-anadromous Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations was investigated using 21 nuclear (microsatellites and allozymes) loci and mitochondrial DNA haplotypes. A neighbour-joining population tree revealed several statistically supported groupings that generally corresponded well with the sampling regions. A comparison of FST and RST estimates with a novel allele size permutation method suggested that at least two of the groups had diverged from each other already prior to the ice receding after the last ice age, thus suggesting that north European Atlantic salmon are derived from at least two separate refugia. We propose that the anadromous and non-anadromous salmon populations from the Baltic Sea basin most likely originate from a southeastern ice-lake refugium. The present day White and Barents Sea basins have probably been colonized from multiple refugia.
23732253|The genera Theonina and Microneta are considered to be very close relatives. The taxonomic features of T. cornix, the type-species of Theonina, are described in detail and compared with those of Microneta viaria, the type-species of the genus described earlier.
23735727|We compared the feeding behaviour of lone tenders, multi-female tenders and post-breeding, non-tending eider females Somateria mollissima in the northern Baltic. Few prey species are available for eiders in the Baltic; in the non-breeding season adults prefer blue mussels Mytilus edulis, whereas small ducklings feed primarily on gammarids Gammarus spp. Infections by the acanthocephalan parasite Polymorphus minutus occur when eiders feed on gammarids and this infection may be fatal if the host's resistance is low. The mussel beds and areas with gammarids are close together but do not overlap. Assuming that females always should prefer blue mussels to gammarids we tested the following predictions: (i) non-tending females should exclusively feed on mussels, (ii) lone tenders may be forced to feed like their young, and (iii) multi-female tenders may occasionally utilise mussels, thereby mitigating constraints associated with consumption of unprofitable gammarid prey. Tending females foraged like their young, whereas non-tending females fed on mussels throughout the brood-rearing season. Individually marked females fed on mussels immediately after losing their brood, suggesting that a conflict between female and duckling feeding needs exists during early brood-rearing. However, later in the season all females and young fed on mussels. Multi-female tenders achieved no obvious foraging benefits compared to lone tenders, indicating that crching in eiders may have primarily evolved for other reasons.
23736061|Fourteen species of Pegomya (Anthomyiidae) are the only significant primary fungivorous flies breeding in Leccinum (Boletaceae) sporophores in Finland. The length of the thorax in the flies is negatively correlated with the number of flies emerging from a sporophore, suggesting increasing larval competition with increasing numbers of larvae in sporophores. Further evidence of competition is provided by a geographical comparison: in Central Europe there are only 2 species of Pegomya that use Leccinum, but their abundance is as high as the pooled abundance of all Pegomya in Finland, i.e. 20 to 50 flies per sporophore. We demonstrate that Pegomya are intraspecifically aggregated amongst sporophores, which will contribute to the coexistence of many species in spite of competition. In Finland, the number of abundant species is about 7 throughout the country, though the species pool decreases from south (13) to north (7). Predation of full-grown larvae and pupae is also severe and may inflict up to 90% mortality. Prolonged diapause is common in Pegomya in Lapland but not in south Finland, probably because of increasing year-to-year variation in sporophore production with latitude.
23736771|Martes martes and Martes foina occur sympatrically in most of Europe. Little is known about differences between trophic niches of these species, because martens are difficult to observe and it is impossible to distinguish between scats of both species based on their morphological features. To resolve this problem, we used DNA extracted from faeces for species identification. This method allowed us to compare the diet of the two species in the area of their sympatric occurrence in central Poland. We analysed the composition of 287 scats of stone martens and 155 of pine martens. Both species fed mainly on small rodents, birds and fruits. Although the trophic niches of both martens highly overlapped, we found significant quantitative differences in their food composition. Pine martens fed more frequently on rodents and birds, and stone martens on fruits and insects. These differences were also visible in the seasonal perspective. Although both martens exploited the same forest habitat, genetic identification of faeces allowed us to indicate significant differences in the diet of these closely related species.
43923476|We tested the usefulness of silicone casts for gathering morphological data from freeranging wildlife by documenting the tracheobronchial anatomy of the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx). The silicone compound accurately reproduced the main aspects of the tracheobronchial branching but the demonstration of smaller airways was less accurate. Evaluation of air-inflated specimens and tracheobronchial casts showed that the right lung consisted of cranial, middle, caudal and accessory lobes, whereas the left lung was divided into cranial and caudal lobes. The left cranial lobe was further divided into cranial and caudal parts. The right cranial lobar bronchus was almost tracheal in location. The trachea had an average of 37 cartilages that showed a pattern of random anastomoses between adjacent cartilages. The silicone compound tested in this study holds promise for its use also under field conditions to gather quantitative morphological data.
23733640|O2 consumption was measured in Eurytemora hirundoides Nordqv. individuals acclimated to two salinities, 3  and 9 . In 9  the animals were unable to maintain osmotic equilibrium, and were therefore thought to face physiological stress when transferred to either lower or higher salinity.
23735476|Developmental instability of harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) that died during the epizootic in 1988 in the Kattegat was compared with that of the population prior to the epizootic to investigate whether animals that died were the developmentally less stable individuals in the population. As an assessment of developmental instability the fractal dimension of the paired maxillo palatinae suture was calculated and the degree of fluctuating asymmetry in teeth, foramina and the paired suture was estimated in a total of 240 skulls. Moreover, prevalences of three pathological changes of the skull were compared. No difference was found in developmental instability or prevalence of skull lesions between animals that died in the epizootic and estimates from the population prior to the epizootic. The lack of difference could be in accordance with the suggestion that organochlorines had an influence on mortality during the epizootic. Levels of organochlorines have decreased in the last decade before the epizootic, and thereby could have equalized differences in levels of developmental stability.
23735749|Population densities are heterogeneous across a variety of spatial scales. The variation in density reflects a similar variety of processes ranging from density-dependent habitat selection at small scales to independently regulated populations at much larger ones. I measured each scale with experiments capitalizing on the behavior of individual deer mice foraging in badland habitats in Alberta, Canada. First, I used patterns in rodent density along transects crossing badland and prairie habitats to measure the scale of habitat selection. Consistent with theoretical predictions, differences in the intercepts of isodars (graphs of density in adjacent habitats assuming ideal habitat selection) comparing prairie and badland densities revealed a maximum scale of habitat selection on the order of only 140 m. Second, I used foraging experiments to estimate density-dependent declines in fitness measured by the surrogate of giving-up-density of mice foraging in artificial foraging patches. Habitat selection should tend to equalize giving-up-densities among replicated, but spatially segregated, grids containing different numbers of foragers. Contrary to predictions from habitat selection theory, giving-up-densities declined with increased forager density in the majority of grids. Giving-up densities in nine of 12 grids increased linearly as population density was reduced in 1997. Giving-up densities in eight of 10 grids increased linearly with resource supplements in 1998. The results of both experiments are consistent with independent resource harvest by varying numbers of foraging mice. The identity of "outlier" grids, that showed little response to either manipulation, varied between years. The combined results document spatially-structured populations and allow us to estimate the frequency of stochastic dynamics that may have a profound influence on evolution and conservation strategies in heterogeneous landscapes.
23736740|We studied the relationships between the occupancy of territory sites and environmental and behaviour-related factors in a declining farmland bird, the ortolan bunting Emberiza hortulana, in southern Finland in 19842003. We investigated the dependence of different factors on population density. The surrounding breeding group positively affected the occupation frequency of territory sites before and after the population crash. Bush- or tree-covered ditches and springtime non-vegetated fields also had positive effect on territory site occupancy. We suggest that large breeding groups, and obvious conspecific attraction, give indications of favourable breeding locations. Habitat deterioration may have pronounced consequences for local populations, in which the breeding group tends to be the unit of population dynamics. The results suggest that for conservation of the ortolan bunting, the maintenance and improvement of structurally and biologically diverse habitats is vital, since tendency to breed in groups apparently makes the species more sensitive to habitat changes than many other farmland species.
23734704|Models of interspecific competition in a stochastic environment show that the effects of environmental fluctuations on species coexistence can be expected to vary from community to community. However, by taking account of some basic properties of the species in a community it is possible to predict whether environmental fluctuations should promote coexistence, promote competitive exclusion or have no effect on species coexistence. One such property is the way the growth rates of the species respond to the joint effects of environment and competition. In simple (additive) models the joint effect of environment and competition is the sum of their separate effects. Deviations from additivity, in either the direction of subadditivity or superadditivity, are important determinants of species coexistence in a fluctuating environment. Such nonadditive growth rates are predicted on the basis of life-history traits, heterogeneity within a population and heterogeneity in space. Nonadditive growth rates have intuitive interpretations in terms of buffers and amplifiers of the joint effects of environment and competition. A second property concerns the way fluctuations in the strength of competition are related to environmental fluctuations. We argue that favorable environmental conditions at some stage in the life cycle of an organism may lead to more competition for resources needed at a later stage, and hence positive covariance between environment and competition. In the presence of positive covariance, subadditive growth rates promote coexistence in a fluctuating environment, while superadditive growth rates promote competitive exclusion. Negative covariance between environment and competition reverses these conclusions.
23735446|In the enamel of Ursus spelaeus, prisms with incomplete prism sheaths dominate, although prisms with complete prism sheaths are also present. The Schmelzmuster consists of two indistinctly separated layers. Dominant is the inner layer characterized by well developed Hunter-Schreger bands. The outer layer, varying in thickness, is formed by radial enamel. Aprismatic enamel was found in a few areas close to the enamel-dentine junction but occurs more frequently on the outer surface. The crystallites of the interprismatic matrix are parallel to the prisms or form a slight angle (max. 45). Although Ursus spelaeus preferred a vegetarian diet, its teeth show typical carnivore enamel and have no similarities with herbivore enamel. In many herbivores, crystallites of the IPM are oriented at wide angles (about 90) to the prisms and frequently form "inter-row sheets". In comparison to the enamel in carnivores, herbivore enamel is derived and often combined with a secondary occlusal surface. Examples, however, show that both characters are independent. The enamel of Ursus spelaeus demonstrates that a specialization of diet over a short period of time does not have an immediate influence upon enamel structure. Only during longer phases of evolution does selection result in an almost perfect correlation of the Schmelzmuster and stress patterns during mastication.
23736528|Mating behaviour has long been proposed as a potential cause of inverse density dependence that can affect the viability of small populations through the reduction of female mating rates. However, under the general designation of mating behaviour we may find a diversity of traits that are likely to influence the mating rate. In the present study, we have analysed the influence of the social mating system, mate choice and mating opportunities on population dynamics given a demographic model that explicitly takes mating behaviour into account. The effect of mate choice on extinction risk depends on aspects such as the social mating system, the probability of accepting unattractive males, mating opportunities and variation in reproductive success. Thus, mate choice per se only leads to a significant increase in extinction risk if the social mating system is monogamous. If mating opportunities are limited, however (e.g. reduced encounter rate), the extinction probability associated with mate choice increases considerably. The risk of extinction associated with mate choice further increases when differences in reproductive success due to male attractiveness are taken into account. A comparative analysis of the establishment success of introduced bird species supports our predictions concerning mate choice. Sexually dichromatic species have a significantly lower establishment success than monochromatic species. However, the establishment success of non-native species was not significantly correlated with the social mating system, so that monogamous species are not less likely to be successful than polygamous species.
23736744|Constant re-evaluation of social affiliations and shifting social network structures can profoundly affect the adaptive fitness of individuals within a population, as well as yielding super-additive effects felt by the population as a whole. To evaluate the impact of different social affiliation choices, and the relative ability of individuals to correctly assess the success of other individuals, we have created a set of mathematical models based on network centrality measures. We choose the hypothetical measures of "popularity", "closeness" and "betweenness" to examine the resulting self-organizations of social groups. Our findings suggest that some different types of social behaviors can lead to the same levels of stability and organizational success, suggesting the possibility that complex organizations could have evolved from simpler ones without any change in the selective pressures acting on the population.
23732274|Rates of development of ova and the first three larval stages were determined in some constant-temperature regimes for British, Icelandic, South-Swedish and Swiss populations. Comparison with data for a Finnish rock-pool population revealed poorer tolerance of high temperatures in larvae from the northern and mountain habitats. At lower temperatures no differences could be detected between the populations. The rates of development of the ova of different populations did not differ.
