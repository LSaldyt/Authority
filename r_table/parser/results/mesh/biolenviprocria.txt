20500016|As part of the first study of the smooth newt in Ireland, a population was monitored at a small pond in Dublin over 3 years. Non-destructive skeletochronology was used to examine the life history of this animal. The investigation has also been the first to monitor the population biology of this species and achieve accurate age estimates without the need to sacrifice large numbers of animals. Most newts were found to mature after four winters on land (4+). However, 20% of males were recorded breeding for the first time as 3+ animals, suggesting that two development strategies are open to males: (1) they can mature at 3+ without the benefits of an additional 1-year's growth on land; or (2) they can delay their maturation for 1 year and increase their potential annual reproductive output at the loss of 1 year's breeding. The oldest animals recorded were 7+, and female predominated in the oldest age classes. Annual survivorship was higher in females than males; the overall survivorship calculated for the population was 43%. A regression of total length with age proved non-significant, but the correlation between weight and age was significant.
20799768|Five adult Dreissena polymorpha were found on the hull of a boat moored in Kinnego Marina, Lough Neagh, in November 2005; this is the first indication of their presence in this large lake. This finding initiated a survey to determine whether the zebra mussel was present throughout Lough Neagh. Forty-four settled juveniles on debris were found at twenty sites around the lough shore. As a result of these findings a more extensive study was undertaken in October 2006 to examine planktonic and settled stages. Veliger larvae were at densities of 0.0211 veligers per m. Spat collectors showed settlement at six out of the seven sites sampled at a mean density of 523.76 juvenile zebra mussels per m. No adult zebra mussels were found on natural substratum in the lough during the shoreline survey. However, 24 adult zebra mussels, 7.5mm to 24mm long, were found on the hull of a boat moored in Lough Neagh.
20499971|There is a paucity of published information on the population biology of salmonids in Irish upland soft-water streams despite their relative importance as salmonid nursery areas and their susceptibility to acidification. This paper describes the characteristics of brown trout populations in upland streams in County Wicklow and identifies some of the factors affecting their distribution. The impact of plantation forestry on salmonid streams in this area is also evaluated. Sixty sites in the upland reaches of the King's, Liffey and Avonmore rivers and the feeder-streams of the Vartry Reservoir were studied in July/October between 1990 and 1992 (Vartry 1990 only). Summer trout densities ranged from 0.009 to 2.93 fish/m but were generally well below 0.6 fish/m. At an elevation above c. 300m numbers fell below 0.2 fish/m at most sites. Fish were recorded at altitudes as high as 460m but were generally not found in stretches of stream above c. 400m, especially where gradients were steep. Trout have, however, been observed in Wicklow streams above the 500m contour. Alkalinity, calcium and pH have been shown to be the key factors affecting the distribution of trout. Adverse changes in water quality, such as depressed pH and elevated levels of toxic inorganic aluminium, may be associated with high levels of forestry in poorly buffered streams, and can in turn deplete trout populations.
20694853|Chemical analyses of cations and anions from five Irish midland raised bogs, from blanket bogs in Galway and Mayo and from groundwater-influenced sites in Mayo, Connemara and the Burren are presented. Principal components analysis clearly separated ombrotrophic from groundwater-influenced sites and showed a clear relation between geography and water chemistry among the ombrotrophic bogs. Nitrification was evident in many stored samples taken from fen sites and in some samples taken from raised-bog peat under birch at a pH of approximately 4.0. The occurrence of Schoenus nigricans in western lowland blanket bogs cannot be explained by raised pH or nutrient status due to sea spray, by freedom from aluminium toxicity near the west coast or by historical differences in grazing between Scotland and Ireland. The data show beyond doubt that S. nigricans occurs extensively in truly ombrotrophic sites in western Ireland. The cationanion balance shows a substantial anion deficit in the midland raised bogs (with no Schoenus), but little or none in the western lowland blanket bogs. Irish blanket-bog occurrences of Schoenus may form part of a wide north-west European pattern: obligate 'fen' plants under continental conditions moving successively into ombrotrophic sites with increasing oceanicityinvolving in turn, inter alia, Eriophorum angustifolium, Narthecium ossifragum and S. nigricans.
20728616|The presence of Anguillicola crassus, an introduced Asian parasite of eels, into south Connemara is reported. European eels Anguilla anguilla were found to be infected in the three basins of varying salinity of Lough Ahalia, but eels sampled in the nearby marine Camus Bay were uninfected. Variations in infection parameters were analysed. It was concluded that the parasite is a recent introduction to the river system. The highest prevalence (63.1%) and mean intensity (4.22) of infection in the lower, most saline, basin of the lough suggest that the parasite was introduced to the River Screebe system at that location. Potential dispersal mechanisms by which the parasite may have been introduced to such a relatively isolated location and to such apparently unexploited eel populations are discussed.
20728608|Clara Bog is an oceanic raised bog of international ecological importance located in central Ireland. The occurrence of soak systems (areas of mesotrophic/minerotrophic vegetation within acid bog) adds greatly to the scientific interest of Clara Bog. Recent research into the vegetation history of a soak system on Clara Bog known as Lough Roe indicates that major vegetation changes have occurred within the soak over the past century. Vegetation communities were classified and mapped on three different occasions over the last thirty years, most recently in 2003. The results show that the characteristic fen type vegetation has changed considerably with increased representation of ombrotrophic species and a decline in open water communities. Indications are that these changes are occurring as a result of human activity over the past century. It is expected that the soak system will be totally dominated by ombrotrophic bog communities within the next 50 years. This paper describes research investigating the possible restoration of poor fen vegetation within the Lough Roe soak system. Results of hydro-chemical sampling and vegetation monitoring indicate that it is possible to recreate more alkaline conditions suitable for poor fen vegetation to develop by removal of Sphagnum-dominated floating scragh vegetation from the soak. The possible application of the research is discussed with reference to potential future restoration and conservation of the site.
20499884|A novel marking scheme, using the Panjet inoculator and alcian blue for uniquely identifying large numbers of trout, was evaluated using a natural population of brown trout. This staining technique was found to be a quick, easy, reliable and durable method, having minimal effect on trout behaviour, condition or mortality, and permitted repeated capture and stomach flushing of individually identified trout over a period of twelve months.
20500192|The selection of appropriate conservation prescriptions for Burren grassland is complicated by its fragmented pattern of occurrence and by marked interpatch and intrapatch heterogeneity in both vegetation and environmental variables. Here, a patch scale study into the relationship between flowering plant species distribution and environmental variables aims to inform prescription selection. We found that patterns in species distribution were related to those in environmental variables such as soil pH and slope. Environmental heterogeneity is created by soil decalcification and downslope mass movement, resulting in exposure of calcareous subsoils on steeper slopes and accumulation of carbonate-poor, more sandy soils at slope bases. Conservation of vegetation diversity requires that processes important in creating this environmental heterogeneity continue to operate. Possible threats to the continuance of these processes are identified.
