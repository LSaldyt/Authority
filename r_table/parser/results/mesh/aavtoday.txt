43855998|Proventricular adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in a budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus) and a Grey-cheeked Parakeet (Brotogeris pyrrhopterus). A tentative diagnosis of gastric neoplasia was made in the budgerigar based on radiographic studies. The Grey-cheeked Parakeet died before clinical evaluations could be performed; histology was required to distinguish the proventricular lesion from chronic inflammatory process. Proventricular carcinoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal disease.
43855997|A congenital abnormality, characterized by two fully formed oviducts, is described in a budgerigar. The right oviduct was filled with gelatinous fluid which formed a space-occupying cyst, resulting in egg binding in the left salpinx. Clinical signs and subsequent surgical intervention are discussed.
