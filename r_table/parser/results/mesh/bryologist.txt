10.2307/3240796|A directory to the some 1,150 most frequently cited authorities for the epithets of mosses, hepatics, and lichens is given with standardized abbreviations of the names for use in bibliographic citations.
10.2307/3242556|Air quality improvement near a coal-fired power plant led to recolonization of Parmelia caperata (L.) Ach. in a pollution-induced void area. Recolonization was first observed about four years after pollution abatement. Least-affected sites, i.e. near the edge of the original void, were first to recover while most-affected sites were slowest to recover. After eight years of improved air quality, the distribution of P. caperata has returned to near normal. Lichen bio-monitoring is useful not only to detect the effects of poor air quality but to document air quality improvement as well.
23321071|This study provides a molecular phylogeny of Solenostoma and Plectocolea based on trnL-F and trnG-intron cpDNA sequences of 25 species represented by multiple accessions from different regions of Russia and some adjacent countries. Phylogenetic trees constructed using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods are mostly congruent, except for an unstable position of P. vulcanicola, P. rosulans and S. caucasica. Based on our analyses we accept narrow generic concepts and provisionally conclude that only P. hyalina and the P. obovata-P. subelliptica-P. obscura-P. harana-P. emarginata complex should be transferred to the genus Solenostoma. Moreover, two species new to science are described and three varieties are elevated to the species level. Morphologically, Solenostoma rossica Bakalin et Vilnet is characterized by heteroicous inflorescences, red-purple pigmentation restricted to the perianth beak and a whitish-colored stem. Solenostoma major (S. Hatt.) Bakalin et Vilnet is characterized by deep purple rhizoid coloration and wide, flattened, undulate and distant leaves. Solenostoma ochotensis Bakalin et Vilnet has a Solenostoma-like perianth and well-developed plectocoleoid perigynium. Plectocolea kurilensis (Bakalin) Bakalin et Vilnet is similar to P. infusca s. str. but differs by commonly having smaller, grayish and more numerous oil-bodies, deflexed antical leaf margins, undulate leaves and purplish to almost purple rhizoids. Plectocolea ovalifolia (Amak.) Bakalin et Vilnet is only distantly similar to P. infusca s. str., as it has purple rhizoids, oil bodies unlike P. infusca, a smaller plant size, generally distant to rarely contiguous leaves, and ovate leaves, as opposed to lingulate to broadly or transversely elliptic leaves. It is suggested the new species originated in the contact zone of circumboreal and temperate East Asian floras with the possible influence of modern volcanic activity.
10.2307/3241751|The intensities of photosynthesis and respiration of three montane mosses were determined at winter low temperatures. The experiments were carried out under outdoor light and at air temperature, the exposure lasting 4-5 hours. The lowest temperature for CO
10.2307/3242320| All Campylopus species reported from North America north of Mexico have been critically revised. Campylopus subleucogaster C. Mll, and C. donnellii (Aust.) Lesq. & Jam. are conspecific with C. surinamensis C. Mll. (= C. gracilicaulis Mitt.). Campylopus angustiretis (Aust.) Lesq. & Jam. is newly combined as a variety of C. surinamensis, and C. atrovirens De Not. var. cucullatifolius is described as new. Campylopus aureus Bosch. & Lac., C. introflexus (Hedw.) Brid., C. oerstedianus (C. Mll.) Mitt, and C. subulatus Schimp, are reported new to North America. There is discussion of each of the species of Campylopus presently known from North America north of Mexico, including remarks on the taxonomy and distinguishing characteristics. A key to all species is given. 
20061099|A collection of Hong Kong lichens in the Farlow Herbarium (FH) resulting from the United States North Pacific Exploration Expedition (1853-1856), and mainly collected by Charles Wright, has been examined with regards to two recently published papers, 12 species new to Hong Kong and almost all of the 46 species listed pre-date the earliest first records for Hong Kong. A new microthelioid lichen, Distothelia isthmospora Aptroot gen. et sp. nov., is described and a new combination, Pyrrhospora chlorophnia (Tuck.) Aptroot & Seaward comb. nov., is proposed.
10.2307/3242535|Orthotrichum alpestre Hornsch. and Tortula muralis Hedw. are reported from Newfoundland, and their distributions are considerably extended eastwards in North America. Six other moss species are new to Newfoundland: Bryum tortifolium Brid., Cyrtomnium hymenophylloides (Hueb.) Nyh., Encalypta ciliata Hedw., E. procera Bruch, Tetradontium repandum (Sturm) Schwaegr. and Tortula norvegica Lindb. Data are also provided for five other species, including distribution maps for Homalothecium sericeum (Hedw.) B.S.G. and Orthotrichum gymnostomum Brid.
20110794|Twenty-six lichen taxa are reported for the first time from either the Tierra del Fuego Archipelago, the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), or both, from collections made by Henry Imshaug and his co-workers between 1968 and 1971 and now housed in the herbarium of Michigan State University (MSC). Of these, Alectoria sarmentosa subsp. vexillifera, Bartlettiella fragilis, Micarea incrassata, M. melaena, Parmelia kerguelensis, Rhizocarpon infernulum and R. submodestum are reported for the first time from South America, and Alectoria nigricans, Brigantiaea fuscolutea, Buellia anisomera, B. subcervina, Caloplaca isidioclada, C. millegrana, Lecidella wulfenii and Megalospora tuberculosa are reported for the first time from Argentina or the Falkland Islands.
10.2307/3244469|The new species Brachymitrion immersum is described based on a single collection from Cameroon. The species appears closely related to the new world B. cochabambae from which it differs in sporophytic characters. Brachymitrion immersum is easily distinguished from the sympatric B. jamesonii and B. moritzianum by its immersed to emergent capsules. The species is illustrated and a key to the species of Brachymitrion is presented.
10.2307/3242827| Bryoria subdivergens (Dahl) Brodo & D. Hawksw., formerly known only from its type locality in southwest Greenland, has now been found in several new sites in western Greenland as well as in an alpine community in the Bitterroot Mountains of Montana, USA. The species is compared with two other members of Bryoria sect. Subdivergentes: B. abbeviata (Mll. Arg.) Brodo & D. Hawksw. and B. oregana (Tuck, ex Nyl.) Brodo & D. Hawksw., and is found to be distinct from both. 
20485782|Acarospora nicolai is revised and a lectotype designated. Acarospora caesiofusca is made a synonym of A. nicolai and a lectotype is designated. Acarospora nicolai is a pruinose brown crustose species containing gyrophoric acid and occurs in Mexico (Puebla) and the United States (Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas) on sandstone.
10.2307/3243728|Anomodon lagoensis Hampe is transferred to Rauiella; R. lagoensis (Hampe) Buck is the oldest name for the better known R. subcatenulata. The other South American species treated as Rauiella are discussed briefly.
10.2307/3244392| The types of sixteen taxa of Amblystegiaceae were studied. Most of these taxa are considered synonyms of other well-known species. Several taxa are lectotypified, most notably Thuidium decipiens De Not. (Palustriella decipiens (De Not.) Ochyra) and Hypnum falcatum Brid. (Palustriella falcata (Brid.) Hedens). The latter seems to be the only representative of the genus in North America: all studied specimens labelled P. decipiens or P. commutata (Hedw.) Ochyra belong to other taxa, except for one specimen of P. commutata, whose geographical origin is unclear. 
10.2307/3241946|The type specimen of Pyxine azorea Nyl. is identical with Parmelia caroliniana Nyl. The species is new to the African continent and the Azores.
10.2307/3240810|Fifteen liverworts and nine mosses are reported as new state records or as verifications of earlier reports. The Appalachian nature of the bryoflora of Pickle Spring in Ste. Genevieve County is discussed.
10.2307/3243214|A quantitative study of marine and maritime lichens on serpentine rock on the north shore of Washington Park, Fidalgo Island (Skagit County), Washington, revealed that major changes in the prominence values (or conspicuousness in the field) of a number of lichens and asssociated organisms occurred in the vicinity of certain elevations. This finding suggests that critical changes in environmental conditions occurred at or near these elevations. When the site was viewed as a whole, the zonation was rather indistinct, primarily because freshwater seepages modified marine-controlled zonation patterns. In addition, patchy patterns of feeding by marine snails and manuring by birds modified the zonal distributions. Upper or lower limits of certain taxa, or of conspicuous "belts" of particular taxa, were used in this study to define zone boundaries. General features of zonation at this site, in nonseepage areas, were similar in some respects to those in British studies.
10.2307/3242417|The new Amazonian liverwort genus Verdoornianthus is considered to be a specialized derivative of the widespread tropical genus Archilejeunea. Differences are the absence of innovations, the dull, suberect leaves, the tristratose rhizoid pad and the larger size of the lobule of the female bracts in Verdoornianthus. There are two species, V. marsupiifolius (Spruce) comb. nov. (Lejeunea marsupiifolia Spruce) from the upstream part of the Rio Negro and V. griffinii sp. nov. from Manaus.
41486719|Events of the sexual reproductive cycle of 11 bryophyte species (mosses and liverworts with monoicous and dioicous sexual conditions) were described for two different sites (montane and sea level) of a Brazilian tropical rain forest, during a 15 month-period. The sex expression of many species was continuous over the whole period, irrespective of the seasons and the forest sites. The specific sexual conditions of dioicous species did not change, but synoicous species had strategies to increase the chances of out-crossing, bearing unisexual branches in addition to bisexual ones. The pattern of gametangia and sporophyte development was different among the species, but the same between the sites. There was a seasonal effect on the maturation of gametangia and sporophytes. Male gametangia were mostly mature by the end of the dry season. Fertilization occurred during the wettest months and sporophytes developed during the dry season, dispersal of spores mostly towards the end of the dry season. Female gametangia were receptive over the whole period, with many mature gametangia before the start of the rainy season. Male gametangia, in contrast to female, took longer to develop and aborted in high numbers. Bryophytes in tropical rain forests are favored by wet weather and mild temperatures. Similar reproductive phenological patterns were found in different habitats with minor variations.
10.2307/3243253|Leucoloma serrulatum, Brachymenium systylium, Macromitrium cirrosum, M. fragilicuspis, Schlotheimia rugifolia and Zelometeorium allionii are reported new to Nicaragua along with twelve additional Departmental records.
3244612|Ophioparma juniperiicola, a new lignicolous species, is described from eastern Spain. It is closely related with O. rubricosa by the appearance of thallus and apothecia, and the presence of divaricatic and usnic acids. The outstanding differences are in spore size and shape and the pycnospore width. Ophioparma juniperiicola is a lignicolous species with granular thallus-often reseambling isidia-and three septate ascospores, with average and size interval do not overlap with other species in the genus. A key of Ophioparma species is presented.
10.2307/3241413|Neosharpiella is described as new on the basis of two species, the type, N. aztecorum sp. nov., of Central America, and Physcomitrium turgidum Mitt., of Ecuador and Bolivia.
10.2307/3243866|Neofuscelia halei sp. nov. is described from Spain and the Canary Islands. This species, named in honor of the late Dr. Mason E. Hale, Jr., differs from the related N. verruculifera (Nyl.) Essl. primarily by its production of alectoronic and gyrophoric acids as major medullary compounds, rather than divaricatic acid, and by its much more limited geographic distribution.
10.2307/3242369|One hundred thirteen taxa of foliose and fruticose lichens are reported from Big Bend National Park, keys to the macrolichens and lists of the localities visited are included. Many taxa were collected infrequently, which may indicate restricted local distributions in the park. New records for North America are: Peltula radicata (Ach.) Nyl., Rechingeria cribellifera (Nyl.) Serv., Heterodermia diademata (Tayl.) Awas. A new combination is made for Heterodermia rugulosa (Kurok.) Wetm. and it is recorded for the first time north of Mexico.
10.2307/3243395|Pleurophascum occidentale is described as a new species from Albany, Western Australia. It differs strongly from Pleurophascum grandiglobum, the only other species in the endemic Southern Hemisphere family Pleurophascaceae. In particular, P. occidentale is a larger plant, 2-3 cm tall, with elliptic leaves about 6 mm long and 2.5 mm wide. The acute apex narrows into a flexuose, hoary, serrate hairpoint.
10.2307/3243490|Geographic patterns of intraspecific variation of isoenzymes were examined in Umbilicaria mammulata (Ach.) Tuck., the most common umbilicate lichen in eastern North America. Multidimensional relationships among thalli from 13 sites were expressed graphically through Principal Components and Cluster Analyses and, in some cases, a close relationship was evident between stands located near one another or aligned with prevailing winds. However, that there was sometimes less similarity between nearby collection sites than between geographically distant ones, was a finding at variance with an earlier study based on fewer collection sites. This result indicates the importance of sampling intensity in isoenzyme studies. Wind patterns in the study area were complex and it was not clear whether wind was involved in dissemination or to some extent responsible for geographic distribution of isozyme patterns. In spite of intraspecific variation, many features of enzyme profiles were consistent throughout the sampling range.
10.2307/3242188|Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems can be divided into two main series: those of continental Antarctica and those of the maritime Antarctic. Within the former series, plant "communities" exist as isolated groupings of plants growing under a severe continental polar-desert climate and appear to be similar to communities of the High Arctic (e.g. the interior plateau of Devon Island). Communities in the maritime Antarctic region are more diverse, with less severe environmental conditions, and show affinities with lichen communities occupying similar habitats in boreal-Arctic zones of the northern hemisphere. Roles played by lichens in the two series of ecosystems are influenced considerably by environmental conditions and in continental Antarctica are often completely subordinated to physical processes. Weathering of substrata, for instance, in continental Antarctica, consists of the operation of several physical processes with lichens playing an insignificant role. It is only in the more suitable habitats found in the maritime Antarctic that lichens are able to play their full role in the development and functioning of ecosystems.
10.2307/3242481|Haplomitrium hookeri (Smith) Nees has been reported for the first time from Western Himalayas, India. The distributional range for this species is significantly extended.
10.2307/3243311|The rare species Lophozia (Isopaches) decolorans (Limpr.) Steph., previously known only from alpine and arctic regions of Europe is reported for western North America. A key to the three holarctic taxa in the subgenus Isopaches (Buch) Schust. is presented. The ecology of L. decolorans is discussed, and the scattered and in part contradictory literature is assessed. The ability to tolerate windswept and intermittently desiccated sites suggests the species may have survived the Pleistocene north of areas of continental glaciation and in ice-free corridors situated (in North America) between the major eastern and western ice sheets.
10.2307/3241694|A study of the collective lichen species Cetraria islandica (L.) Ach. based upon some 3,000 individuals from 100 localities in Iceland shows that the extreme morphological variation is not correlated with the chemical variation (presence or absence of fumarprotocetraric acid). This is in striking contrast to the high correlation of chemical and morphological characters in this species complex on the European mainland, which serves there as the basis for the separation of C. islandica sens. str. and C. ericetorum Opiz. Differences in the geographical distribution of the chemical characters, fertility, and the range of morphological variability indicate that there are two ecological races in Iceland: 1) a fumarprotocetraric acid-producing, nonfertile race with rather narrow morphological variability, mainly distributed along the coasts and in the more oceanic southern part of the country, and 2) a morphologically and chemically variable race (with or without fumarprotocetraric acid), frequently fertile, and distributed throughout the Central Highlands and northern Iceland. In the latter race, the frequent occurrence of both chemical types within the same morpho-phenotype at individual localities indicates that gene exchange may occur between the fumarprotocetraric acid-producing and the fumarprotocetraric acid-lacking plants.
10.2307/3242534|Explanted premeiotic sporocytes of field-collected plants of the liverwort Sphaerocarpos texanus Aust. were cultured on defined medium in depression slides. The sporocytes underwent meiosis and early stages of spore wall formation. These results indicate that this liverwort may be useful in biochemical studies of meiosis.
3244348|Harpidium nashii Scheidegger, sp. nov. is described as new to science. The species is similar to Harpidium rutilans, hitherto the only species of the genus, but differs considerably in thallus morphology. Harpidium nashii is known from four localities in Baja California and California. This is the first report of the genus Harpidium from outside Europe.
10.2307/3242021| There are presently 91 species and one subspecies, in 39 genera and 23 families of Hepaticae, recorded from the Yukon Territory, Canada. Sixty-three species are from literature reports and 28 species and one sub species are reported here as new. Significant range extensions are recorded for Macrodiplophyllum microdontum (Mitt.) Perss., Radula prolifera Arn., Scapania spitzbergensis (Lindb.) K.Mll., Frullania tamarisci (L.) Dum. and Hygrolejeunea alaskana Schuster & Steere. With more intensive field work the number of taxa found in the Yukon can be expected to increase greatly. 
10.2307/3242847|The genus Glyphothecium Hampe (Ptychomniaceae) is treated herein as comprised of three species. Glyphothecium sciuroides (Hook.) Hampe is reported for the first time to occur in the New World, growing sympatrically with G. gracile (Hampe) Broth. in Patagonia. The distribution of G. gracile in parts of the world other than southern South America is questioned. Morphological distinctions between G. sciuroides and G. gracile are clarified for the first time. The disjunct distribution of G. sciuroides is correlated with the distribution of a known phorophyte, Nothofagus.
10.2307/3242954|Porotrichum neomexicanum (Card.) Wagn., which has been considered a rare endemic moss known only from Arizona and New Mexico, is believed to be a synonym of the common western North American species, Metaneckera menziesii (Hook. ex Drumm.) Steere.
10.2307/3242376|Grimmia cribrosa Hedw. is reported for two new localities in Canada, Ellesmere Island, N.W.T. and Thunder Bay District, Ontario. Its distribution in North America is mapped.
10.2307/3243509|Epiphytic lichens and bryophytes were studied on five major tree species occurring in two forest regions over 1,200 km apart, the Adirondack Mountains, New York and the Southern Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina. The trees were Acer saccharum, A. rubrum, Betula alleghaniensis, Fagus grandifolia, and Tsuga canadensis. Comparison of species composition and ordinations using quantitative frequency and cover measurements for the five major tree species showed that very few species were host specific, but that most communities of lichens, of bryophytes, and of both combined, were specific to particular tree species. Climate and plant geography proved important to host specificity of these cryptogamic communities. Many more species of lichens than bryophytes occurred as epiphytes; crustose lichens were particularly important in the Adirondacks. Higher diversity of lichen epiphytes, particularly foliose, in the Southern Appalachians influenced differences in host specificity between the two regions. Comparisons are made with previous epiphyte studies in Eastern North America.
10.2307/3242962|A new species of Dicranum, D. tubulifolium, is described from northern Mexico. The species is apparently related to D. muehlenbeckii B.S.G. of North America, Europe and Asia. Two new combinations are made in the Hypnaceae, Isopterygium machrisianum (Crum) Irel. and Taxiphyllum robusticaule (Bartr.) Irel. Three species of Isopterygium, I. distichaceum (Mitt.) Jaeg. & Sauerb., I. homomallifolium Redf. and I. muellerianum (Schimp.) Jaeg. & Sauerb., are reported new to Mexico and a key to the species of the country is presented. The morphology of Mittenothamnium scalpellifolium is discussed.
10.2307/3241535|A type specimen is designated to validate the name Leucodon brachypus var. andrewsianus Crum & Anderson.
41486722|Trichocolea japonica is described as a new species from central Japan, characterized by regular branching habit, massive verrucae on the surface of the leaf cilia, and linear to semiannular thickenings in the epidermal cells of the capsule wall.
10.2307/3241303|Water relations of living lichens, dead lichens, and cellulose model lichens were studied at different relative humidities. An air flow system allowed instantaneous weight measurement while water uptake or loss was occurring. In all cases, living lichens had the greatest uptake rates, followed by dead lichens and cellulose models. Nonaqueous staining techniques showed that in living, but not in dead lichens, most of the water is held in the algal layer. The processes of water vapor uptake and water loss are apparently physical, and the differences in rates can be explained by differences in the physical properties of the test materials.
10.2307/3244470|Didymodon norrisii Zand. is a new species of moss found in California and Oregon, U.S.A., belonging to Didymodon sect. Rufidulus (Chen) Zand. It differs most saliently from congeners by the combination of the deep brick or rose red color in KOH, costa covered by quadrate epidermal cells nearly to the leaf insertion on both sides, and apparent asexual reproduction through fragile branch apices. The new species is included in a key to the North American (north of Mexico) taxa.
3244683|A set of 700 moss specimens from the Monies Azules Biosphere Reserve accounts for a list of 136 species and varieties, including ten species new to Mexico, for the Lacandon Forest of eastern Chiapas. With the addition of eight published reports, a total of 144 taxa are now recorded from major habitats in this area. The Caribbean relationships in this moss flora, with 82 species, are the most important while endemic taxa are virtually absent. Although the neotropical character of the Lacandon Forest moss flora is further emphasized by eleven Meso-American species, the widely distributed groups are also represented; 31 pantropical and 14 disjunct taxa are shared with other tropical areas. The patterns of distribution, the life-forms, and the structural diversity of mosses are features that should be preserved in eastern Chiapas in order to maintain biological attributes that have been eliminated from other tropical areas in Mexico.
20110819|The history and usage of the name Rinodina Rinodina chrysomelaena is discussed. The name is typified and the distribution of the species documented.
10.2307/3242976|Biomass was estimated in stands at about 600 m elevation. Epiphytes were divided into three categories: lichens with blue-green phycobionts, lichens with green phycobionts only, and bryophytes. Total biomass was 3500 kg ha
10.2307/3243243|Data on weight-class distribution, growth rate and asexual propagule (lobule) release are used to analyze populations of the nitrogen-fixing lichen Lobaria oregana in old-growth Douglas fir canopies of western Oregon. A life-table model prepared from observed data is used to produce an estimate of net annual production of biomass, and to analyze the response of a population of this lichen to possible environmental perturbations. The weight-class distribution is similar in each of four trees studied and at different levels within the trees, but differed among the different components of the trees. Survivorship curves (log survivorship versus estimated thallus age) are similar for populations in all trees studied. Estimated net annual production is 31.1% of the standing crop of Lobaria oregana biomass. Mathematical manipulation of matrix formulations of the life-table model indicates that populations would be stable if they recruited 10% of the lobules released each year. In such a configuration, the model population returns to its original size and distribution within 30 years following a simulated storm that removes 90% of the largest thalli and momentarily increases lobule production.
40732259|Lichen diversity and coverage on willow oaks were measured in 16 parks in the Raleigh area of North Carolina, plus one natural area in nearby Orange County (control), as a pilot study for a potential statewide lichen biomonitoring project. This study's objectives were to assess the air pollution effects of the Raleigh urban airshed on these lichen communities, and determine what methods are best for this bioassessment. Thirty-one macrolichens and 24 crustose lichens were detected with average trunk floras of 4-20 taxa per site. Lichen communities were dominated by: Buellia curtisii, Candelaria concolor, Candelariella reflexa, Lecanora strobilina, L. hybocarpa, Physcia millegrana, Pyxine subcinerea and Punctelia rudecta, of which the macrolichen species are known to be pollution-tolerant, including Py. subcinerea, which is here described as such. The control site largely lacked these species, and harbored lichens more representative of nearby protected forests. All sites lacked pollution-sensitive beard lichens (Usnea spp.) and cyanolichens that are found in protected forests. Lichen Diversity Value (LDV) analysis of macrolichens did not result in the expected pattern of increasing diversity further away from the city center, due to a number of factors. However, negative correlations were found between lichen diversity variables and human population and traffic variables, as well as between tree trunk size and crustose lichen diversity. Macrolichen species richness and abundance were higher on mossy trunks, but crustose lichen diversity was lower. Bark texture and moisture as well as air quality appeared to influence the structure and composition of these lichen communities. In summary, the lichen communities on the urban trees appeared to be affected by the region's air pollution both in terms of diversity and species composition. Diversity measures are best tracked if the total community is measured, not just the macrolichen component. Crustose lichen coverage should also be incorporated in abundance studies.
10.2307/3242848|Fungi were observed in the central hydroid strand of underground axes of Polytrichum commune Hedw. Hyphal strands appeared continuous from hydroid to hydroid in certain cases, apparently penetrating the lateral walls of hydroids. Hyphae were also observed on the epidermal surfaces of the rhizomes. Newly initiated gametophores and mature gametophores appeared robust and healthy. Whether the moss-fungus association is a host-parasite relationship or mycorrhizal-like was not determined.
3244665|Tayloria maidenii Broth. is known only from the type locality in eastern Australia. Examination of the type material reveals that this taxon belongs neither in the genus Tayloria nor in the Splachnaceae. Type material of Tayloria maidenii is referable to Entosthodon laxus (Hook. f. & Wilson) Mitt. (Funariaceae). A lectotype for Tayloria maidenii Broth. is designated.
10.2307/3241313|Six hepatics and two mosses are reported as new to Arizona. The taxonomy of Orthotrichum laevigatum fo. macounii is discussed.
20110884|Pleuridium mexicanum is hereby reported for the first time for the U.S.A. from the Santa Ynez Mountains in Santa Barbara County, California. This discovery adds a third species of Pleuridium recorded for California.
10.2307/3241670|The lichen substances produced by 14 species are reported for the first time. The new data constitute the first chemical reports for any species of the genera Arthonia, Bacidia, Lopadium, Omphalodium, Protoblastenia, Solenopsora, and Toninia.
10.2307/3242245|The holotype of Didymodon trifarius (Hedw.) Roehl. proved to be Saelania glaucescens (Hedw.) Broth. The taxon commonly referred to by the former name should now be called D. luridus Hornsch. in Spreng.
10.2307/3243309|Grimmia limprichtii Kern was found 1993 in the French Hautes Alps. This rare alpine species, described in 1897 from the Italian Alps, was subsequently recorded from some French and Swiss localities. Because Loeske incorrectly considered it to be a muticousform ofG. anodon Bruch et Schimp., the species was more or less forgotten. Its morphology, taxonomy, ecology, and distribution are briefly outlined. Grimmia obtusifolia Gao & Cao, recently described from the Himalayas, is conspecific with G. limprichtii Kern.
20110900|A checklist of the 310 bryophyte taxa (two hornworts, 46 liverworts and 262 mosses) reported to occur within the political boundaries of the state of Nevada is presented. 238 new county records are also listed. Notes are provided for species with complex synonymies, taxonomic difficulties or interesting histories. This checklist is intended to improve efforts towards a complete bryophyte flora of the state by identifying those species, habitats and geographic regions that have been neglected or poorly sampled.
10.2307/3244525|Bryophytes provide microhabitats for aquatic invertebrates, many of which are capable of anhydrobiosis. Densities of nematodes, tardigrades, rotifers, and other invertebrates recovered from Eurhynchium oreganum (Sull.) Jaeg, were determined for over one year at an Oregon Coast Range site. Extraction efficiency of Baermann funnels was evaluated by collection on subsequent days followed by squeezing and agigation of moss. Densities of the nematodes, Eudorylaimus spp. and Plectus spp., varied significantly between sampling dates, but densities of Monhystera spp., Tylenchus spp., and Prionchulus muscorum Dujardin did not. Total tardigrade and mite densities differed significantly between sampling dates, but rotifer, amphipod, and turbellarian densities did not. Nematode densities were within the low range of densities previously reported from mosses. Motility efficiency may affect nematode distribution within mosses. Baermann funnels were effective in recovering nematodes and tardigrades, but not rotifers from moss. Nutrient cycling by moss-dwelling aquatic invertebrates is implied by the diversity of their feeding strategies.
3244870| Isopterygium tenerum (Sw.) Mitt., a species previously considered restricted to the New World, is reported for the first time from the Old World. Examination of the type collections of three South African species that were given names under Plagiothecium and Isopterygium, namely Plagiothecium rhynchostegioides Mll. Hal., P. sphagnadelphus Mll. Hal., and Isopterygium brachycarpum Dixon, revealed their conspecificity with I. tenerum. Accordingly, this species is established as one more Afro-American disjunct species. Some gametophytic structures of the type specimens of the South African species are illustrated.

20110956|The interaction between UV radiation and mineral availability has not been investigated in bryophytes, despite the important peculiarities of their mineral nutrition. The question under investigation was whether an improvement in phosphorus (P) availability, and the consequent increase in tissue P concentration, modified the responses to enhanced UV radiation in two aquatic bryophytes (the liverwort Jungermannia exsertifolia subsp. cordifolia and the moss Fontinalis antipyretica) under laboratory conditions. These responses were evaluated in terms of photosynthetic pigment composition, chlorophyll fluorescence, photosynthesis and respiration rates and the accumulation of protecting UV-absorbing compounds (both the commonly used bulk UV-absorbance of methanol extracts in both species and the concentrations of five hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives in the liverwort). The culture period (36 days) affected significantly most variables of both species. However, no variable in either species showed significant differences between the P-supplemented and non-supplemented samples at the end of the experiment, except the vitality index
10.2307/3242350|One new species of Everniastrum, E. paramense, and four new species of Hypotrachyna, H. cendensis, H. meridensis, H. neoflavida and H. primitiva, are described from the paramo region of Venezuela.
10.2307/3243984|Keys, descriptions, illustrations, and discussions are provided for the 11 species of Pleurozia (Jungermanniales, Pleuroziaceae). The unusual morphology of the genus is reviewed. The evolutionary relations within Pleurozia are explored through a cladistic analysis, and as a result of this analysis, two new subgenera are described: Constantifolia and Diversifolia. The genus Eopleurozia is reduced to synonymy under Pleurozia subg. Exauriculata. Pleurozia curiosa from New Caledonia, and P. conchifolia var. papillosa from Indonesia are newly described.
10.2307/3243405|Eleven species of Frullania occur in North America west of the hundredth meridian. The species are discussed and a key is provided. The following are new reports: F. bolanderi in Alaska and Arizona; F. brittoniae in Arizona; F. inflata in Nebraska; F. eboracensis in Arizona, New Mexico, and South Dakota; and F. riparia in Arizona and Colorado.
10.2307/3241625|Desmatodon randii (Kenn.) Laz., possessing a widely disjunct distribution between Europe and North America, has had its European glacial refuge in the recent Ukrainian locality, from where the Baltic Sea shores were invaded. An inbred laboratory culture line has retained a vigorous fertility through 15 successive generations but, on the other hand, also gave rise to a spontaneous apogamous line in haplophase, which, perpetuated vegetatively, has behaved as a persistent modification; being reproduced, however, by apogamous spores, it has lost apogamy stepwise, passing through an amphomorphic stage.
10.2307/3243145|Syrrhopodon isthmi Reese, sp. nov. (Musci; Calymperaceae), is described and illustrated from Panama, Prov. Panama. Diagnostic features include a narrow border on the leaves, ventrally bulging cancellinae, smooth leaf cells, and spinose-ciliate leaf tips.

3244695|Growth form and substrate influences on elemental accumulation patterns were investigated in four lichen species. Two fruticose species (Usnea amblyoclada on rock and Usnea hirta on bark) and two foliose species (Flavoparmelia caperata on rock and Flavopunctelia flaventior on bark) were collected below Massai Point in Chiricahua National Monument in southeastern Arizona, U.S.A. Samples were analyzed for 14 elements. A two-way ANOVA model was used to examine the relationships between substrate and growth form (independent variables) on element accumulation (dependent variable) patterns in lichen samples. In the ANOVA model the growth form variable was significant for K, Ca, Ti, Ba, Fe, Ni Cu, Zn, Pb, Rb, and Sr while the substrate variable was significant for K, Ti, Mn, Fe, Ni, Rb, and Sr. A significant interaction between the two class variables was observed for P, K, Ti, Mn, Fe Ni, Rb, and Sr. Accumulation of sulfur appeared to be independent of both growth form and substrate influences. In this study growth form was a key factor affecting element accumulation patterns in lichens. It is proposed that thallus continuity and orientation, which partially define growth form characteristics, influenced the accumulation of elements from airborne and substrate sources.
3244595| This paper reports nine new moss records for Mexico from the Lacandona Forest: Calymperes rubiginosum, Fissidens guianensis var. guianensis, Mniomalia viridis, Orthostichella hexasticha, Orthostichopsis praetermisa, Phyllodrepanium falcifolium, Syrrhopodon flexifolius, Syrrhopodon africanus subsp. graminicola, and Syrrhopodon hornschuchii. Findings reported here demonstrate that there is still incomplete knowledge of the moss diversity in the Lacandona tropical rain forest region. Future research in tropical forests of southeastern Mexico and Central America will help to corroborate the continuity of distributional patterns from South America to North America through the Central American bridge. /// Se comunican nueve registros nuevos para Mxico de la Selva Lacandona: Calymperes rubiginosum, Fissidens guianensis var. guianensis.

20110781|A large-scale metabolic screen was performed for 51,180 targeted knockout mutants of the haploid moss Physcomitrella patens (Hedw.) Bruch & Schimp. The growth ability of each mutant was compared to the wild type. Plants were cultured on a minimal medium which contained only macroelements, as well as on a supplemented medium, additionally containing microelements, glucose, vitamins, ammonium tartrate, adenine, peptone and Na-palmitic acid. The screen resulted in the identification of 20 (0.04%) auxotrophs. Medium supplementation tests were performed for five auxotrophs, which showed no growth on minimal medium, but were rescued on supplemented medium. One vitamin-deficient mutant was identified as p-aminobenzoic acid auxotroph, three plants were nitrate assimilation deficient mutants and one transformant showed undefined growth requirements. The screen resulted further in the identification of two physiological mutants, exhibiting an albino phenotype on minimal medium but a green wild type phenotype on the supplemented medium. The culture of both albinos under low light intensities could not prevent bleaching, revealing that the missing production of chlorophyll was not caused by light sensitivity. Astonishingly, the supplementation of the minimal medium with selected compounds of the supplemented medium did also not prevent bleaching. Moreover, both mutants produced green protonemata, even if single substances of the supplemented medium were lacking. It was concluded that a complex network of interactions related to photosynthesis in Physcomitrella was disturbed. This is the first detailed study of auxotrophic and albino Physcomitrella mutants produced by transformation-mediated gene disruption. The described physiological mutants provide valuable resources for the identification of essential gene functions of plant metabolism.

10.2307/3242212|Data on growth and reproduction in relation to microclimate in boreal forest populations of Polytrichum alpestre Hoppe at Elma and Pinawa, Manitoba, and in sub-Arctic populations at Churchill, Manitoba, are compared with previous results from Antarctic regions. Thermistor readings at 15-60 min intervals for over two years indicated that moss level temperatures at Pinawa were relatively stable between 0C and -10C beneath winter snow cover but showed wide diurnal fluctuation in summer. Mean daily maxima were commonly ca. 40C from May through August, but mean daytime temperatures were normally ca. 15 degrees lower. Freeze-thaw cycles in spring and autumn were less frequent, with higher minimum temperatures, at moss level than 200 cm above the ground. Shoots of P. alpestre show annual growth segments due to variation in the length of leaves produced at different times during the summer growing season. Stem elongation at Pinawa plotted against time showed a sigmoid curve. Both stem elongation and leaf production occurred principally during June and July, but current season growth segments may continue to increase in weight until September. The mid-summer cessation of stem elongation showed no strong correlation with temperature or moss water content. A similar sigmoid pattern was recorded when plants were grown under constant environmental conditions, at photoperiods of 12 h or 17 h, suggesting that growth may be partially under endogenous control. Shoots less than 4 years old predominated in samples from colonies at Pinawa and at Churchill. Replacement occurred through the development of lateral shoots from buds commonly located 5-10 cm behind the apex of the parent shoot. The young shoots were initially non-photosynthetic, bearing only white tomentum and scale leaves until the apices reached the surface of the turf. Net annual shoot production in two colonies at Churchill was estimated as 97 and 148 g m
