20794475|In Belgium as in the rest of north-western Europe, the restoration of heath-lands has become a major nature conservation priority. The target species for this restoration process may be present in the relict seed bank, which can be used to restore the ecological diversity of heathlands successfully. This study focuses on the consequences of a highly dynamic and complex historical land use pattern on the composition and heathland restoration potential of the soil seed bank of a sand stone hill in central Belgium. The presence of typical heathland species was negatively correlated with historical orchard land use. Former land use as orchard imposed both biotic (low seed densities of target species) and abiotic (high soil phosphate level) constraints in the restoration of heathland. Time since abandonment of the heathland and conifer land use negatively affected the presence of heathland species due to seed senescence in the heathland species seed bank. Especially more than 50 years after the reference land use, the number of heathland species has become very small and restoration is hardly possible. On parcels that had no historical orchard land use and having a current land use as oak-birch forest, the chance of successful restoration of heathland is greatest. Densities of heathland species in the seed bank of these parcels are relatively high and the densities of non-target, potentially competing, species are relatively low.
20794476|The Kansanshi copper outcrop (Zambia) has been very poorly investigated botanically. A recent survey has revealed much of floristic interest, in spite of mineral exploitation since the beginning of the XXth century. The various vegetation types still occurring there today indicate a former richness both in terms of flora and phytosociology as well as phytogeochemistry. Ecological units have been classified on the basis of the topography and vegetation composition. Several copper-accumulating taxa, including three new hyperaccumulators are reported. Various environmental management proposals are suggested with a view to preserving the existing biotopes in the face of the potential threats of further mineral extraction. Le gisement cuprifre de Kansanshi (Zambie), trs peu prospect jusqu prsent d'un point de vue botanique, recle un grand intrt, et ce, en dpit de l'exploitation minire dont il fit l'objet depuis le dbut du XXme sicle. En effet, les divers facis prsents aujourd'hui tmoignent de la richesse tant floristique et phytosociologique que phytogochimique existant par le pass. Un certain nombre d'units cologiques y ont t recenses sur base de la topographie et de la vgtation rencontre. Plusieurs taxons accumulateurs, voire hyperaccumulateurs, de cuivre s'y rvlent. Dans une perspective de prservation des biotopes prsents et d'une reprise ventuelle de l'activit minire, un certain nombre de propositions de gestion du milieu sont suggres.
20794474|A wide range of variation of Zn concentrations in leaves occurs between individuals within an Armeria maritima population growing on Zn-rich spoil heaps from an old Zn-Pb mine. Experiments on controlled soil conditions with a metallicolous A. maritima population show that there is a family (genotypical) component for Zn leaf concentrations. Specific Plumbaginaceae-excreting glands regulate to some extent the Zn concentrations in capitulum stalks and probably leaves. Under greenhouse culture conditions, a non-tolerant coastal population can grow reasonably well for several months on an highly toxic soil, accumulating two to four times more Zn in leaves and performing better in Zn accumulation per individual than mine populations. Additional examples from populations of Thlaspi caerulescens suggest the general assumption that search for genotypes efficient for phytoremediations must not be restricted to metallophyte populations.
43996253|A new genus of agarics, Heinemannomyces is described and assigned to the Agaricaceae ; the spore-print cast is lazuline blue. A single species is recognised, H. splendidissima Watl. sp. nov., with a known distribution in Malaysia and Thailand.

Une cl de dtermination est propose; la mise en synonymie de diffrentes espces est discute. This revision permitted to determine 12 species with 4 varieties and 4 cultivars. A determination key is proposed and the synonymy is discussed.
20794669|In this paper, results from an intensive two-year monitoring campaign of a wetland gradient are presented and analyzed. Two spatially adjacent sites along a wetland gradient are described by means of abiotic variables, groundwater level, and soil temperature and soil moisture at several depths throughout the vertical soil profile. The vegetation of the sites is described on the basis of a species cover inventory, and two different vegetation types are distinguished along the wetland gradient: Arrhenatheretum elatioris at the highest end of the gradient and Caricetum gracilis at the lowest end. Aboveground biomass and leaf area index of both Arrhenatheretum elatioris and Caricetum gracilis were measured on a monthly basis, and their seasonal variation could be related to specific site conditions. Furthermore, evidence was found that vegetation was not passive to the environmental site conditions but actively influenced them. The groundwater at the lower Caricetum gracilis site showed diurnal fluctuations with amplitudes up to 10 cm, which could be attributed to transpiration losses by phreatophytes.
20794625|In terms of phytosociology Nuphar lutea and Nymphaea alba are species characteristic of the same nymphaeid association. In many lakes, however, they develop separate communities. Habitat differences between patches of both species may thus be expected. The aim of this study was to find out if neighbouring patches of Nuphar lutea and Nymphaea alba were characterised by different water and substratum properties. Field investigations ware carried out in a shallow lake with well-developed macrophytic vegetation (Lake Jarosawieckie, Wielkopolski National Park, mid-Western Poland). An additional sampling site was located in the macrophyte-free mid-lake. Water and substratum samples were collected twelve times during a two-year study. Considering the whole data set, the water properties did not differentiate significantly the studied phytocoenoses and the open water. Temporal differences appeared to be more significant. In the case of substratum properties, habitat differentiation was found for organic matter content, which was significantly higher at the Nymphaea alba site, whereas total nitrogen content was higher at the mid-lake site. Seasonal dynamics of the habitats followed a similar pattern for the water properties, whereas differences in organic matter content were found for the substratum properties.
